lk6grz,The truth is? Nobody cares anymore.,"Not just Greek Row. As a ""primary source"", someone living in the dorms, I can tell you that the people living in the dorms and hanging out around campus don't care either. No social distancing at all, a bunch of friends playing in the snow together or inviting each other over into dorms for little kickbacks, etc.

Greek Row gets scapegoated once again while not a **single** soul on the Ave, Campus, U-District, etc. follows guidelines. Is Greek Row wrong? Yes. But if you want a petition to suspend them, you better suspend the dorm students as well. In other words, suspend everyone who came out to live on/near campus this year.

It's extremely naive to think they are the only ones in the entire city of Seattle ""ruining it for us"" hahaha, HFS ain't even truly regulating shit to be completely honest. I remember when we had a fire drill and we all huddled up together on the field. Some employee said ""hey, social distancing"" and nobody listened and remained huddled up. Like, hundreds of people.

It is what it is. You guys who are completely remote (most of the people on this reddit) just have no idea what's really going on. The problem is everyone, me included. Shit really got worse in regards to social distancing after the constant stream of great vaccine news, I'll tell you that much.

Go ahead and downvote this post, but I'm just telling it like it is: they aren't the only ones and honestly haven't been since like September. The entire United States fucked this one up, and so we just wait until we're vaccinated by summer and carry on with our lives. If Fall is online again, it wasn't because of Greek Row. It was due to poor vaccine distribution. But, Biden is making good progress and daily vaccinations passed the million mark, so there's that. Cheers.

Edit: If you wanted to complain about Greek Row in the summer, that makes sense. Vaccine was far off and the situation was ""in control"" up until that point around early July. But now? Give me break. We're averaging 1000+ cases a day (7-day average) without their help. This shit is all fucked.


Edit 2: No I’m not gonna go around taking pictures of the dorm people or people around campus and report back to this subreddit. I’m not fucking weird. Remember that deleted post from the summer where one of you weirdos took a picture of some Greek people chilling on their front lawn with their live-in mates and complained despite the fact that that was their family unit? That was fucking weird and I’m not gonna become that.

I honestly wonder like, do these people really think it was a good idea to sit in jam packed traffic just to come take some dumb pictures in a giant crowd? Seriously? There is no way in hell it is enjoyable at that point and they shouldn’t have come. 

 I’ve always had a slight distaste for tourists because I feel like they get in the way of people who are actually affiliated with the school in some way but most of the time I remain indifferent since they seem docile.

3svoj7,How can the Black Lives Matter movement gain YOUR support on campus?,"As this is a college subreddit, I was wondering why you do or don't support Black Lives Matter.

One of the main issues I see with this movement is that it has horrible leadership. Perhaps it is an issue with media coverage but it always seems that some idiot gets everyone fired up in the wrong way (i.e. getting up in Bernie Sanders face, blocking highways, or most recently blocking 45th).

Also, they seem to pick the wrong people to use as symbolism for their movement. Mike Brown was the go-to representative death to use for the BLM protests, but he was a violent thief that charged a cop. Why not choose Eric Garner or Ervin Edwards?

Also this mob thinking that all white people are the same and that colored people cannot be prejudiced. Some of the most hateful, racist comments I have ever heard uttered have been from black people (but most recently the internationals who come here who rant about EACH OTHER! Chinese vs japanese, koreans vs japanese etc). That's just my anecdotal evidence, not saying all are like that, but that's what I have been exposed to.

This video in particular, during which they silence a young asian woman speaking out against group-think and taking a very MLK like stance really grinds my gears: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8UTj8lQJhY

We have to face the facts: black people are disproportionately targetted by police, were the original targets of drug war campaigns, are underepresented due to their low economic class, underepresented further by the high rate of felony incarceration which leaves them unable to vote for life, and of course daily misjudgement and treatment by other races who fear/loathe them because of persistant blind bigotry, and the gangs and high crime rates the black race is associated with here in America.

However, as one commenter said below, the BLM crowd tends to focus on these outside forces and never on internals. The black populace needs to be equipped with the institutional tools and financial support to rid their communities of black on black violence, reinforce the role of fathers, drive the gangs and violent criminals out, and educate their children so that they don't fall into the poverty trap that is the current state of black society.

These are blatant faults that are not the MAJORITY of the reason their society remains beaten down after so many years of ""equal opportunity"" laws, but should be acknowledged by the BLM crowd as further evidence that the black community needs attention. Replacing the constant ""check your privilege"" jabs and anti-white brigades with this acknowledgement won't piss off the people who are in position to help you and will gain the support of other minorities who face many of the same issues.

s1r1lj,Still Mad about CSE 143E Still Having No Resubmissions,"Really am struggling to get over this. In a recent Q&A session, Hunter Schafer addressed the absence of resubmissions for this quarter of CSE 143. He explained the reason for the absence was ""a Staffing Issue"".

There is no doubt resubmissions have a significant impact on your grade. This was one of the only ways I was able to learn in 142; in these times of pandemic there already isn't much teacher-to-student contact and communication. I used feedback from my TA's as a place to get personal help and explanations on what I was doing right or wrong and then have the opportunity to resubmit with my new knowledge. Now we are in a new offering of 143 that has even less teacher to student contact, due to the lectures being videos from other quarters, and there still is no resubmissions

So now my grade might suffer drastically due to a ""staffing issue"".

Not saying the CS department is to blame for this. Sounds like there truly is a shortage of TAs this quarter. Not sure what the solution is, but what's frustrating is there are staffing issues plaguing UW in all areas yet we are still getting charged the full price to go here.  \~60k for me to not receive what is promised from this education. For example, we are forced to have a dining plan if on campus but the dining options are super inaccessible due to ""staffing issues"". Well if you didn't require it then there would be less strain on the dining system and in turn higher accessibility. Of course, this won't happen because UW has proven time and time again it loves money.

I understand they don't have enough TA's for resubmissions, I just think they should do something grading-wise to account for this change, something that would still give me a chance in competing with students who took 143 in a quarter that had resubmissions.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/s1r1lj/still_mad_about_cse_143e_still_having_no/,15,0

Are overpriced soggy sandwiches draining your bank account? Are the slippyred bois in Red Square making your tushie hurt? Perhaps a support group is for you.

The UW is currently investing hundreds of millions into the fossil fuel industrial complex, and we need the UW community's help to stop it!

ICA is about to formally file their demands but the UW board won't recognize anything unless we show there is ""broad support"". So it is URGENT that you [SIGN THE PETITION](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOgjCNpHwtPFFJu3X5YidOgJQgGXoIS9tPexiG-pPU_gpP2w/viewform) and share it with all students, faculty, groups, etc. to let those in power know that industries funding police and violent suppression of human rights and the deadly Climate Crisis WILL NO LONGER BE TOLERATED!

I chose to attend UW because I liked the weather and my program is ranked highly but I never thought this place was this crazy. How are the faculty and especially the students of a university not allowed to speak freely? Every time I speak on topics such as how republicans have some good policies or give an opinion such as how the lack of women programmers can actually be explained scientifically and not just solely on them being oppressed, I am looked at weirdly and ostracized. I heard they are trying to force out a CS professor for some of his views, we live in America for goodness sake we are supposed to be allowed to do things freely within reason. I had an HCDE professor ask to speak outside the classroom solely because I said some of Seattle's policies enable the drug problem. We are in a university of God's sake, differing opinions are NORMAL. If the school and the people in the school want to keep pushing the narrative that they welcome everyone then could we please start looking at ourselves in the mirror and ask why this is being allowed to happen?

1hpgce,Keep NSA Out: Encrypted Email Services for University of Washington,"Our school currently contracts with two of the corporations implicated in the NSA spying scandal for email services: Microsoft and Google. Continuing to provide these compromised services is a disservice to students and faculty. Free speech is vital to the university environment and we must be able to rest assured that our ""private"" communications with our professors and colleagues are not being spied on by government agencies or corporations. 

I recently contacted school officials about the issue and received this response:

>We actually have special contracts in place with both Google and Microsoft ensuring a certain level of privacy and full FERPA compliance.  The UW Google Apps account we offer, for example, is different and has a higher level of privacy than a consumer gmail account.  **We don't have any plans to abandon either Microsoft's or Google's cloud based email solutions, in fact, we are currently working to implement Microsoft's newest version of their service: Office 365.**
>
>Having said that, most of our decisions regarding email are a direct result of decisions made by the Student Tech Fee Committee:

>http://techfee.washington.edu/
>
>**If you would like to see resources devoted to a more secure or private email system, you may want to consider submitting a proposal.**
>
>--Chad Haffenden, Consultant, Customer Services, UW Information Technology, University of Washington

Due to the University of Washington's plan to continue using compromised services, we are in desperate need of a new email service. This service could be self-hosted and implement the latest encryption technology to better protect students and faculty.

I would like to find like-minded individuals that would be interested in making secure communications at our university a reality! Computer Science and Engineering has considerable resources and talent that could assist in development of this system.

We've asked graduates from across the Humanities Division to write about what their current jobs are like, and how their educations helped prepare them for the challenges and responsibilities of their current work.

Right now, we're spotlighting Maureen Trantham, who discusses how her humanities education has helped her to become Senior Vice President of Operations, Social Impact and Philanthropy at Sesame Workshop (yes, the people who make Sesame Street)!

Maureen majored in Comparative History of Ideas (CHID) and Journalism. She writes, “At the UW, my CHID and Journalism professors not only encouraged me to engage in my own independent research and inquiry through the Mary Gates Undergraduate Research Scholarship, but also apply my learnings and develop practical skills via internships like the Journalism Foreign Intrigue Program. This blend of theory and practice taught me to be flexible, creative, pragmatic and solution-oriented. It also strengthened my ability to pull from multiple disciplines to deconstruct a problem – whether I am advising executives, analyzing the merits of different strategies or developing implementation plans. This laid the foundation for my work in journalism, education policy and advocacy, management consulting and now operations at Sesame.”

Because it seems like not everyone knows: 
• You’re not immune to SARS-CoV-2 because you got vaccinated 
• You can still shed the virus if you’re still vaccinated 
• You shed DAYS BEFORE you develop symptoms and you’re at your most infectious during this time 
• Others are still not vaccinated and some cannot get vaccinated 
• Masks work to prevent spread to those around you and they don’t work if you have your nose out. 

All in all, remember to distance and mask up. These preventative measures protect no only yourself, but everyone else and that’s exactly why we have to keep doing them.

ofynwi,These vaccination attestation forms,"Got the attestation form email earlier today and it seems… lazy to say the least. The same check boxes to fill out for both employees and students and it takes less than 5 minutes to click through without verifying any information and relying entirely on the honor system. They also never mention how they can enforce any of this since vaccination stuff is classified information? How easy would it be for some a$$hole antivaxxer to quickly lie on their attestation form and show up to class without a mask on or being vaccinated. No one would be able to verify anything and we’d have another outbreak on our hands because of it. I’ve been fully vaccinated for a while now but I’ll be carpooling with someone who medically cannot be vaccinated and no matter how much they protect themselves with the mask or distancing, all it takes is a couple meaningless clicks for their life to be at risk. More than anything, these attestation and exemption forms don’t seem to do much besides give the university a cop-out excuse if another outbreak does happen.",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ofynwi/these_vaccination_attestation_forms/,7,7
1af6esk,is there even a chance to get accepted?,"i'm currently a 3rd year pre-major in an out of state university, but i've been struggling academically.

for a small backstory, i grew up in an abusive household and don’t have the best mental health. all the years of abuse reached its peak and its making it hard for me to keep up with school, so i've decided to take a break this semester to recoup. my gpa is definitely under 2.0, which is not competitive at all for what UW looks for. i also only went to the university i'm at because it's what my parents wanted. i come to realize that i can’t achieve what i want as well as thrive under my current living conditions, so i would like to transfer to a school i actually want to be at. 

with that being said, is there even a chance for me to get accepted? i bet its very unlikely due to my low GPA, but i do have a lot of EC throughout my college years + my high school years. i also had a 3.7 GPA in high school and took a lot of dual enrollment classes, so i once was academically successful.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1af6esk/is_there_even_a_chance_to_get_accepted/,19,2

fk1b3f,Someone invited me to cheat with them on a test,"So, with finals and midterm retakes being offered online, there is a test in the next few days that will determine a decent chunk of our grade. This guy that I've seen around invites me to work in a group with him on the test, and uhhhh, I don't wanna do that cause the test is supposed to be individual. 

 My question to the people who roam this subreddit, should I tell the professor that this person is working in a group on this specific test? 

Some details:
1. Class is not curved
2. Not a lot of people taking this test so it's easy to distinguish who is cheating
3. I don't even know his name or his major, so this isn't personal
4. I know a friend who is friends with this person, so it's possible to figure how his identity
5. He will be taking 3 different tests, which I am fairly certain that he will be working in a group for all of them. Therefore, giving him an advantage
6. I have studied for this test, so it's not a sense of jealously (I think)

I don't wanna ruin someone's life over uncurved exams, but I don't like the fact that he is getting an intentional advantage. Related question, am I the asshole for feeling this way?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/fk1b3f/someone_invited_me_to_cheat_with_them_on_a_test/,18,0

Do people find that GPA plays a big role in landing better internships? If so, is there a strategy for avoiding certain courses that might bring you down until later years? I’m primarily concerned about required non-major courses as those seem to have the most potential for subjectivity.

I might be overthinking it, but I keep reading horror stories of professors at various schools who curve down or classes that nobody can get an A in and want to keep that in mind when the time comes to plan my schedule.

26tln0,Why is the UW screwing over students so hard in tuition?," Why is the tuition a whopping $12.5k a year when the UW is sitting on an endowment bank of 2.3 billion dollars up 235 million on last year? If they took the 235 million dollar increase from last year and put it towards lowering the tuition of the 29 thousand undergraduate students they would  have lowered it by over $8k meaning it would instead cost us only $4.5k. They would still have their 2.1 billion dollar bank that they had last year.

And to make matters worse despite the overpriced tuition and large endowment the university still won't get its act together regarding the abysmal acceptance rates of its engineering schools and other programs. Computer science and engineering has dropped below a 28% acceptance rate and other programs are having similar funding issues.

What the fuck is going on and why the fuck are we getting screwed over so hard? What happened to this being a public university? I don't know how they expect students like me to be able to afford $27k a year costs. The only reason I'm able to keep attending is because summer software internships pay well and I work 40 hours each week while going part-time(which doesn't save much on tuition...). Which is pretty pathetic for a public university. By no means is the problem only relevant to the UW. It's an issue across the entire American public university system at the moment.

5pg06u,Response to UW Presidential Statement Regarding Shooting,"If you're a UW student, you should've gotten President Ana Mari's email about our non-acceptance to violence.

A few months ago, a Muslim girl was attacked on campus. We asked that an email be sent out at the time, so that the UW community would not make light of crimes against Muslims or put anyone's safety in jeopardy.The perpetrator was on the loose, we wanted to know who he was.

CAIR set up a press conference on Red Square, and yet the UW did not release any statement on the assault. CAIR even put up a reward for any information on the attacker.. and still a silence from the university.

I am asking you to respond to Ana Mari's email informing her about your concern for violence using the template below and how silence about it may mean it will reoccur. A strict stance against it means speaking about it every time it happens and finding every subscriber to it.

Fill in the spaces regarding your affiliation the UW, and your name at the end. Copy/paste into a reply email to the President's earlier statement (and share with your friends).

Dear President Ana Mari,

I am writing to you today not only out of gratitude for your acknowledgment of the incidents which transpired last night, as well as your reaffirment of our University’s intent to serve as a violence-free zone, but also out of disappointment over the lack of similar concern over a violent act which occurred on-campus the afternoon of November 15th, 2016.

The messages you espoused regarding the election results on November 9th were hopeful and inspiring. As a ___________ (student, faculty member, worker, researcher, alumni, etc.) of the University of Washington, I was proud to uphold “...our responsibility to serve the public good...” which would “never waver” and to be working “...to reaffirm our ongoing and unwavering support toward creating and nurturing an inclusive, diverse and welcoming community.”

However, that right and gratitude was tarnished shortly after the receival of such uplifting messages, when I heard no word from my University’s President concerning the violent physical assault of a female Muslim student on-campus. This silence spoke volumes. Instead of apologizing on behalf of the University for the struggles she faced on its grounds, and educating the rest of the community body on the crime’s specifics to promote help in finding the perpetrator, and providing information for everybody’s safety, I can only assume an e-mail sent on November 17th was intended to encompass this incident along with others by stating, “[t]here have...been several reports of harassment, vandalism and violent incidents, in our state and even on our own campuses. We want to be clear: assault, discrimination, harassment, or vandalism have no place on our campuses.”

Although such statements were necessary to make, they were not sufficient. The nature of this crime was such that the outrage for this crime, seeking justice for this crime, and intolerance for any such crime - then, now, and in the future - should stand alone, and not be inferred as being a part of a broader statement. This was an assault, this was discrimination, and this must be prevented in the future in keeping with the vision for this University that you have shared of a nurturing, inclusive, and welcoming community.

My concern is the safety of everyone on campus, as is yours. I hope to see action from the University of Washington administration that reflects a consciousness for every student regardless of their background, way of life, or faith. The concern should be vocal, prominent, and transparent.

I thank you in advance for your willingness to speak up on behalf of all of us, especially the purposely marginalized.

Sincerely,

cxr7mj,CS Direct Admit first quarter schedule/other general advice,"Hey guys,

I'm an incoming freshman DA and I am worried about the schedule I am registered for currently; I tried reaching out to a cs advisor but they haven't gotten back to me yet. I'd really appreciate any advice you have for me.

The classes I'm registered for now are CSE 311, 351, and 391, with a 7 credit Landscape Architecture FIG. The total credit amount is 16, but it will be 18 after adding the DA Seminar class. I'm concerned that this schedule would be very time-consuming. I know a lot of students take two CSE classes a quarter but 17 credits are quite intimidating. I was hoping to take a lighter course load for this fall quarter in order to get used to UW and the dorms, make new friends and have fun, focus on trying to get an internship, etc. What do you guys think? 

I am leaning towards dropping 351 and 391 and adding an easier general education class, but I wanted to know if I'd be alright for the future and not too overwhelmed with CSE classes. For reference, I am bringing in 105 total credits from running start/AP and would like to graduate in three years. I need 23 more credits of general education, need to take Phys 122 and Math 308, and then the rest are CSE classes. I want to balance how many CSE courses I take so that I don't take too many or too little in the 3rd year. I want to fill out the rest of my classes with electives in business, statistics, economics, communications, etc. to help me in the industry. I am unsure of double majoring/minoring. 

Finally, I want to get a new laptop for school and was interested in the difference between MacBooks and Windows laptops for CSE. Would MacBooks be easier? I heard they might because they are Unix machines but I have no knowledge about that. Do most students prefer one over another? I would love to buy a MacBook pro but they are very expensive, even with the student discount right now. Would a premium laptop be helpful with the nice computer labs in the CS buildings?

Do you guys have any other general advice for new computer science students?

Thanks

1bkp5gk,Why the fascination with Ivys over CS at UDub,"Unless  the CS rankings on USNews and other sites are totally messed up, the way I look at it is that besides MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU and UIUC, every other college is ranked lower for CS. And looking beyond the rankings, I see so many other tangible advantages that aren’t taken into account in the rankings - like UDub’s proximity to all the amazing companies in Seattle - Amazon, Meta, Google, the endowments from Pauly boy and BillyG, the guest lectures by Distinguished Scientists from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others, the wealth of nearby companies to intern at who don’t have to pay for your accommodation in this tight market, the startup scene, and the constantly rising bar of incoming CS Freshman, mostly gene-gifted kids of the sea of software engineer parents in the Puget Sound and beyond. I think UDub CS has an amazing future.

Yet I see this intense fascination with the lesser ranked Ivies and non-Ivies. Are these folks mere brand name chasers who want bragging rights, and/or have been conditioned to think that way by their helicopter parents, or am I missing something else. Do they not know about the CS ranking? Have they just given up on UDUb as out of staters, given its heavy preference for instaters?

tnwahh,So far have any of you met someone “crazy left” like everyone says UW has? Or has this school been basically been stereotyped as one?,"The only time I can remember is that famous video/meme when there were anti-racism protestors yelling in the library and when a foreign Korean student said “this is library” (basically asking them to quiet down) then the protestors immediately told him to “go back to Beijing”. 

I believe everyone has a right to protest when it comes to racial inequality but you’re literally gonna go to a library where the rules are to be quiet so people can study and then get mad and  immediately blurt racial slurs just because someone politely asked you to be quiet? Hypocrisy much? Like do you even care about your movement if you’re just making yourselves look worse?

Anyways,

I also do remember the Republican club being banned or something but I don’t really care ab that anyways. Let’s be real who in their right mind would join a Republican club at uw? Or join one in general?

On the other hand, I do see a lot of those annoying pro-life/anti-lgbtqia people with the speakers on telling everyone they’ll go to hell and stuff like that.

People warned me that this school is a “leftist hell hole” with a bunch of teenagers following “woke” trends but really “don’t know what they’re talking about and just repeat what they hear on Twitter” and etc.

But so far, I haven’t seen any of that. I haven’t seen an evergreen college situation. Is it just me? Has anyone else had a politically annoying person bother them in some way? If not, where tf is this reputation coming from? I get we’re in WA but they’re acting like the dining hall only has vegan food or something.

ao2q4u,We don't have all the information about the recent tragedy! Stop witch hunting!,"I think it's important to remember that in the face of tragedy it's easy to leap to conclusions. While the recent death on campus is a truly horrible event, we simply don't know enough to make a judgement on the role of the administration in the recent death.

&#x200B;

All the evidence we have that the administration could have prevented the tragedy is a haphazard collection of anecdotes. Sure, people are posting here that they slipped and fell and that they saw substandard work being done to de-ice walkways, but is that really enough to make an empirical judgement on the safety of campus? A bunch of random redditors and students can't judge the administration's effectiveness in dealing with the ice, instead we need an official investigation by qualified authorities. 

&#x200B;

Next, I'm not convinced that we should be expecting the university to completely de-ice campus. Is it reasonable to buy enough salt and sand to cover all of the walkways on campus, and is there enough time and money to hire the workers needed to spread it? I don't know, and neither do you. We simply aren't aware of the logistics behind a thorough campus de-icing, and before leaping to the conclusion that the administration is mishandling the situation we should consider the possibility that completely de-icing the campus (as some people on this sub seem to want) is unfeasible.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I'm sure the administration is under considerable pressure to reopen campus as soon as possible. Every day campus is closed, the university is losing a considerable amount of money. Research isn't being done, floors aren't being cleaned, books aren't being shelved, students aren't being educated. Cauce simply can't shut down  campus without extremely good reason. A death is more than enough reason to close campus, but hindsight is 20/20. Cauce chose to open campus with the knowledge that something like this may happen, because there was obviously still ice on the ground. Us experiencing such a tragedy doesn't necessarily mean the Cauce made the wrong call. 

&#x200B;

Of course, the administration could be at fault. The thing is, we don't have enough information yet to say. Stop jumping to conclusions!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ao2q4u/we_dont_have_all_the_information_about_the_recent/,3,0

n7kdi7,I feel like the whole uni is being my enemy,"I think I'm doing alright in academics, but when I attend class, or even thinking of going to campus this upcoming fall, I feel like everyone would gang up on me and throw hate, and even try to make fun of me; stress from studying doesn't bother me, but thinking of meeting a fellow student from UW is now a biggest fear I have now because I keep building anxiety of thoughts that everyone fucking hates me. And now it just turned into a scale of whole uni; I'm scared of even being here but I have to stay to graduate. 

I'm just done with everything, I'm fucking done. I don't want to feel like shit for not being able to express my opinion and always criticized for what I say; yes most of things were very dumb and I just ranted about things and apparently people got really mad and confused about it making me feel dumb but that's fine. But I guess no matter how nice I approach or how much I try, at least nobody in this school going to take me seriously and be friend or even acquaintance. ""People are usually nice here."" Yes that might've been true to you, but not for me. Or some of you might say ""You probably have never really try to be friends with them."" Well I tried. I tried to talk to classmate and tried to be active on discussion, everything. And almost every single one of them treated my opinion and thoughts like a garbage. I feel like I'm extreme minority who never gets along. There was literally no room for me to really ""enjoy"" this place and opportunity I have without fearing the backfire and aftermath of me speaking up. 
But then you might say ""well if your opportunity is shit, that's what you get"". I think it's not civil when you try to put me down for having different opinion. 

I guess it started with imposter syndrome, but it turned into something bigger than I thought, and I just need a help. I'm gonna get downvotes but I just wanted to share a piece of thoughts. Some of you might say ""well that's not what everyone thinks and people I've seen so far are nice so you are wrong."" I don't care how nice everyone was to you, my encounter and experiences in this place was terrifying and lonely all the time. I don't want to have a debate over if my feeling is right or wrong. Just scroll down if me or this post bothers you because it's cringe. I know I am cringe for everyone but I think I'm still entitled to how I feel. I'm fucking terrified with this place.

40pna2,"Why is everyone on reddit udub a CS, Math, or engineering major?","My title is obviously an exaggeration but it's to highlight something I've noticed.

Why does it seem like an overwhelming amount of people who post here are either computer science, math, or engineering majors?

I know computer science and engineering are popular degrees at UW, but as far as I'm aware Math isn't a very popular major relatively speaking. I'm a math major and it's rare for me to find other math majors in general ed courses.

There are a ton of people at UW who major in biology and I also know psychology is a popular degree as well. Yet I rarely ever hear anybody on this reddit say they are either one of these degrees.

Also what about the liberal arts and the social sciences? I think I've only seen maybe 2 or so people say they are a liberal arts or social science major. I've seen a little more people say they are business majors, but again not very much despite the fact that business also is a pretty popular degree at UW.

Do you think it's possible that people who don't major in STEM don't post here or don't admit to being a non-STEM major even if they post here because of potential STEM degree arrogance on the part of STEM students?

If you think that explanation is wrong what do you think is a possible explanation for this? Or do any of you disagree with my observation to begin with?

After lots of research, I have found that if you want to be a UW CS major as a running start student it is most important that you get the CS major [prerequisites](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/currentuw) finished ([with nearly perfect grades](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/transfer)) so you can enroll for direct admission into the CS major as a freshman because as of 2019 the CS major became a [predominantly direct admission major](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm). You should only go for an associate's degree if you have enough leftover classes after finishing the prerequisites for the CS major with high grades. An associate's degree is good for your resume and working before you get your bachelor's. I don't think most people will work at more than minimum wage jobs until after completing their major anyways, making the associate's degree seem nearly pointless for UW CS majors. After completing the prerequisites it is important to get as many [CS Major Graduation Requirements](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/ugrad/curriculum/CS_reqs_wi22.pdf) as your community college offers as possible to finish the required courses at an easier and cheaper college.

I did really well in HW but Finals screwed me over. If it weren’t for the finals, I would have 4.0’ed it. I am not just gonna rant and not offer a solution. Imo they should only have Cr/Nc for people who need it for graduation requirement. 

It wasn’t fair when they cancelled finals last quarter. It isn’t fair now!

184u4ow,Your thoughts on urinals in all-gender restrooms?,"Right outside the classrooms in the basement of the Art Building, there’s an all-gender restroom with a urinal. Certainly not a common setup on campus. It doesn’t bother me and most of my classmates seem okay with it. Based on my experience, people of all genders are able to behave like adults while using it and just go about their business without bothering anyone else (though I don’t know to what extent there’s a self-selection bias in terms of who’ll use this bathroom).

What are your thoughts? If you’ve used this restroom (or any other one like it on campus???), how was your experience? And if you haven’t, would you use it when there might be someone of another gender in there with you? And would people support/feel comfortable if this kind of bathroom situation became more common across campus—like if buildings without existing single-use gender neutral bathrooms had **some** of their gendered ones degendered for inclusivity?

I know this is all done in some seemingly-positive effort to try and force students to feel like school still matters or whatever, but doesn't even motivate me to go to class! If anything I'm flooded with anxiety and loath the class more and more. These tricks and gimmicks to force attendance just feel insensitive and deceptive. Attendance shouldn't be mandatory.

qpsjxa,Faux-Change,"Yesterday I posted a picture of garbage as the result of a party hosted by a Greek House. 

First an update, they have filled a few bags with trash but have decided that any trash that has strayed beyond what is directly in front of their house as not their problem. That trash is there because of your party, so pick it up! That is the mindset of those dawgs and it is why I said that trash is never picked up. 

I want to point out the absurdity in the outrage that followed my post. Why are you getting upset over something that is illegal and causing harm? Are you not outraged when somebody is unjustly killed or raped or do you pass the responsibility of a crime onto the victim? Maybe the issue isn't so clear because our environment does not have a voice, but protecting it is just as valid a reason as protecting another human from injustices. Drop the antiquated and misogynistic idea of ""we're just having fun"" or ""it's not a big deal."" These are the same arguments that people of privilege use to justify their disgusting actions against the lesser in society. If you are one of those people who are angry with police-brutality, racism, inequality, dismissal of victims, but are at the same time outraged because somebody is bringing to light your own bad actions, then you are just advocating faux-change and latching onto movements because everybody else is doing it.

1oggek,"""End Rape"" and Reporting Other Graffiti","I think students at UW would appreciate the fact I think it should be common knowledge that there has been a recent graffiti outbreak both on campus and in the U-District.

The graffiti I am referencing reads ""End Rape"", and first showed up a few weeks ago, with more appearing just this last weekend.

Obviously if you know anyone who might have been involved in writing graffiti or has actually written this or other graffiti, you should contact the Seattle Police Department at phone number (206) 625-5011.

I understand [from this page](https://www.seattle.gov/police/contact/reporting/default.htm) that if your tip leads to an arrest or charge, you can earn up to a $1,000 reward. (Disclosure: tip leading to an arrest on graffiti will probably only get you $10-$20. HOWEVER, since this same graffiti is sprouting up everywhere, I'd imagine they would hand over something closer to $100-$150, especially since some of it is on-campus.)

You can also report graffiti to SPD using [this online report form](http://www.seattle.gov/police/prevention/graffiti.htm). It takes about 5 minutes.

aojiqg,I feel uneasy about this.,"So while the ice wasn't directly to blame for her death, it doesn't change the fact campus was still left with dangerous conditions. They could of done better deicing campus, as shown by the response of ice clean up directly after the death of that student. 

It doesn't change the fact that people still injured themselves on the ice the past few days. If you have limited mobility or a mobility based disability it was extremely challenging to navigate campus, unreasonably so. It doesn't change the fact that people didn't feel safe on campus. People are saying we're treating students like they're inept by advocating for less ice on campus. But not all of us are familiar with navigating ice. Not all of us can just get back up if we slip on the ice. Not all of us can pay for a trip to the doctor if we fall and get a concussion or break our nose (both of which happened to people due to the ice).

People jumped to conclusions but that doesn't change the fact that campus was still dangerous. UW didn't take proper precautions, didn't work on cleaning up the ice and then when something might of happened due to it, they finally cleaned everything up. They could of done better from the start and that's clear. 

I'm not calling for anyone's head on a plate, just I feel uneasy that the state of discussion about the ice has turned to ""it's just ice, stop being such a baby"" and people being downvoted for anything to the contrary. It's clear we tend to have a bad mob mentality, even now with our response with concern to the ice after we realized someone didn't die as a direct result of it.

It must be great to be short and just hide under your little canopy of umbrellas but god damn it's just so selfish.

For example, pigs are quite intelligent and, for this reason, I do not eat them.   I do not have a hard a fast rule for which animals I will and will not eat.  But, the larger, older or more intelligent an animal, the less likely I am to eat it.

I understand that most of the plant food we eat does not live that long.  But, let's suppose, for example, that humans could eat oak trees.  I would definitely avoid eating oak trees because of their immense size and age.  Same goes for those beautiful cherry trees we have on campus.

So, to reiterate my question for the vegans in the room (or anybody I guess): are plants that you avoid eating, specifically because you think it is wrong to do so rather than because the plant was farmed in a unsustainable or environmentally unfriendly way?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/rgbpxv/serious_question_for_vegans/,14,1

8rddso,Univ. of Washington vs. Univ. of Connecticut?,"Husky vs. Husky

I'm a rising junior in high school. Connecticut resident. I know going to an OOS public school isn't... smart... but I know that the University of Washington is a great school and I've always wanted to visit/live in Seattle (never been, though; I should probably do that). 

UConn's also a great school, but I don't know about the campus life. I'm not into partying or anything, but the only thing to do over there is to visit the cows they have on a farm and sporting events that I have little interest in (I'm down for hockey, though. How's that at UW?). Apparently administration is pretty uncooperative as well at UConn. 

I'm pretty sure that UConn and UW (if that's the correct abbreviation) are pretty much equal in academics. **I'm more concerned with post-graduation: co-op/research/etc. opportunities, job market, career guidance/resources, etc.**

**Prospective majors/programs — in order of interest:** 

- Chemistry 

- Pre-pharmacy (will likely major in chem during this time, and I'd hope to get both degrees)

- Engineering (big oof; Chemical Engineering or Material Science and Engineering) 

- Pre-dentistry (would also major in chem and hope to get degree in both)

- Undeclared if I can't figure it out by then. 

Also, how similar to NYC is Seattle? I'm not too fond of the former, but Seattle seems like it's own thing. 

Back to hockey: what team do you guys like over there? You don't have a team, so I guess I'm free to continue rooting for the Rangers. Big criterion in my college search.

“Guys did you hear? Delta variant is a thing and now cases are going up again, we’re fucked! Everything’s locking down, UW Seattle is going online! Fuck!”


“Guys, COVID hasn’t disappeared off the face of the earth yet! We need to go back online before we die!”


SHUT THE FUCK UP. SHUT THE FUCK UP. SHUT THE FUCK UP.


Please fucking read what I’m going to type right here: **COVID-19 will fucking wax and wane for fucking ever, due to not every American vaccinating and not 100% efficacy rates. And? Who the FUCK cares. Seriously, with all due respect, who. The. Fuck. Cares.**


Use your fucking brains for one fucking second: do you really fucking think every time there is a fucking spike (which will happen for the next 2-5 years), the entire world will shut down and we have to fucking go back on Zoom and wait until its “normal” again and then it spikes again and then we go back online and then we go back to in-person but wait nope it spiked back online, etc. etc. for fucking ever? **Or do we fucking accept that this shit is here and fucking LIVE WITH IT.**


At least **Ana Marie Cauce** has a fucking brain and literally put it into basic words for you fucks to understand: it will **WAX AND WANE**. You know what that means? Nobody is going to fucking base their entire logistical decisions around it anymore. Nobody is going to fucking launch their organization’s finances into the pits of hell to deal with “spikes” that don’t cause hospitalizations (at least in, you know, fucking **Seattle**. The only place that fucking matters here). 


You know, I used to hate Ana Marie. Now I realize she is the only one around here with a fucking brain. If she was like you dumb fucks, she would’ve announced online for the next 10 years just in case we get the occasional COVID-19 case or two (remember that virus? yeah me neither). But nope, she had a brain, and y’all are going IN-PERSON thanks to that.


“But but…a school in Texas is going online!”


Have you fucking seen Greg Abbott? Have you fucking seen him? Have you fucking seen the vaccination rates over there? Do you really wanna play this dumb fucking game of comparing **Texas** to **SEATTLE**, you know, the fucking city that had a cop-free zone not too long ago with extremely high vaccination rates?


Guys, please laugh with me for a second 😂 Can you fucking imagine the packed dorms (McMahon included) being sent home because of a resurgence of a virus that ~100% of the student population is vaccinated against? 😂😂😂😂 Fucking LMAO.


I will say it again, loud and clear for your ape brains to understand: **You are going in-person. You will have to ask mommy and daddy for school supplies and get your first day of school outfit ready and make sure you aren’t late to your first day honey! And last but not least, SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP with these fucking doomsday posts about OMG we might go online 🥺 because NO YOU FUCKING WON’T UNLESS COVID-20 SPAWNS AND THE VACCINES NO LONGER WORK, BUT EVEN THEN YOU PROBABLY WON’t BECAUSE WE DO NOT GIVE A FLYING FUCK ANYMORE.**

ltttpi,Questions on drinking/partying/social life/housing from an exchange student from the UK,"Obvious COVID disclaimer, any questions related to partying assume it'll be safe to do so next year.

I will (most likely) be studying as a junior at UW next year as an exchange student from the UK, and my only knowledge of drinking/partying/social life at US colleges comes from TV and movies so I've got like a dozen questions. Male, will be 20 for most of the school year.

Given the drinking age of 18, ""partying"" at uni in the UK involves just buying alcohol and drinking in halls, or going to university bars, or going to clubs/bars in the city (I live in London) like any adult. Pretty standard at my uni at least would be clubbing or going to student bar 2-4 times a week. How does UW compare?

The consensus from previous posts seems to be that if you're not ""in the Greek system"", as a guy you're not going to get into any frat parties. Is this still/actually the case? Also, what does ""in"" mean? Do you have to actually be in a frat, or if you are friends with fraternity member(s) will you be able to reliably get onto guestlists? Or is having friends get you on guestlists more of a sometimes works/sometimes doesn't thing?

If to reliably (like every week or fortnight) get into frat parties you actually have to be in a frat, is this an option for an exchange student? 

What are the non-frat options like? Do people under 21 generally have fake IDs and go to clubs/bars in the city? How common are non-frat house parties, and how is it to get into them? Is it just a case of knowing people?

Do most juniors/seniors live off-campus? I don't really want to have to try to organise private accom abroad, so assume I'll apply for halls/apartments, so would I live predominantly with people younger than me?

Are any halls more/less social than others? (the reputation seems to change year by year from previous posts). What are apartments like, as in do they have staff, or can you just drink as if it were private accom?

2g1xc0,What is actually GOOD about UW in comparison to other colleges?,"So far, all that I've heard is horror stories, and a general feeling of ""meh"".

Housing is really expensive, and the system is poorly organized. The undergrad classes aren't as exceptional as the high academic rating, which only comes from the amazing graduate schools, would make it seem. Class selection is average (in comparison to other colleges). 

Registration is horrible. But like many other things, this is mainly because of the awful technology department. 

The enormous population decreases the quality of everything. Housing becomes highly limited, registration is crowded and competitive, there are fewer open job opportunities, less professor-student interaction due to large classes,  etc. 
You just become another part of the huge, faceless crowd. Making friends or distinguishing yourself in any way is difficult because the sheer number of people, unless you deliberately go out of your way to do so. 


I need someone to remind me that there are other reasons to go here besides the cost and convenience for in-state students. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/2g1xc0/what_is_actually_good_about_uw_in_comparison_to/,30,2

evqade,Why are we still so chill about the Ave,"Edit: Now I am really disappointed. On my last edit I said something about how I felt safe in China. People immediately started firing at me and some say I’m a 12 year old and some say I embarrassed the rest of you. I seriously lost hope in this city. I am an outsider and I will leave in just one year. I absolutely have no duty in making this place safer. However, I think it is in everyone’s favor that tragical incidents will not happen in the future. I posted this, at least as a reminder to raise awareness. What do I get? Criticism and hatred. Is it all because I said China is safer? There are a lot of country that are safer than the US and you are just going to sit there and be grumpy about it? I thought I did a good thing posting this in remembrance of the horrible incident that happened on the Ave yesterday. Apparently I’m wrong. You rather things stay this way than having an outsider pointing out the problem should be dealt with. 

           ————————Original Post———————

Almost everyday there is violent crime happening somewhere near the Ave. I just saw the email saying a girl was assaulted, pushed to the ground and slashed with a razor blade. Yesterday some one displayed a pistol; and just days ago some one even had an ax.

Why are we still so chill about it. The Ave has become the home for homeless people and every time I walk near them I feel deeply disturbed because they are all crazy and yell on the street all day. Incidents like those happen almost everyday and never was a suspect ever found by the police. There are no cameras, no nothing. And UW never did anything other than sending emails. As an university, UW has the responsibility to make its campus a safe place for everyone; but now, our very life is threatened everyday and there is nothing they are doing to prevent it. If it was other places, students would go on a strike a long time ago. We have to do something. Crimes like this is happening more and more often and we cannot just sit back and watch them happen. Next time, the victim might be us.

Edit: Why no one is focusing on the real underlying problem I’m trying to say here? I am not saying homeless people are the cause of all those problems. I don’t believe it was homeless people who robbed key bank yesterday, and I am not saying we should just make them leave. I am truly sorry for them and I often help them whenever I can. However, there are a lot of crazy people around the campus and you cannot deny that by saying the Ave is not part of the campus, that’s just ridiculous and lying to yourself. What I’m trying to say is we should urge the university and the police department to have better protection.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/evqade/why_are_we_still_so_chill_about_the_ave/,65,60

88ooyx,Feasibility of a CS Double-Major? (Hear me Out...),"So I am currently in the IBDP, and the way things are going, it's looking like UW is going to give me 45 credits at the start of my freshman year for doing so. From what I have seen, this is approximately a year's worth considering the minimum to graduate is 180 creds.

I am also a DA for UW CS, so that's my planned major.

I don't want to graduate early. So I have been thinking about possible alternatives. One of which is double-majoring. Now under normal circumstances I would understand being bombarded with ""dude, don't do it, you're going to die"" comments, but it doesn't seem that double-majoring within four years with 45 starting credits seems that ridiculous. But of course, I accept that I am probably totally naïve. 

I know that CS is going to be hard, but I think that doing another supplementary major like Statistics or Physics or something that would make me even more attractive for hiring could be a good idea. 

Any thoughts on this? Is there anyone who has done this with one of the majors being CS? Is this the most idiotic plan you've ever heard?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/88ooyx/feasibility_of_a_cs_doublemajor_hear_me_out/,34,4

96lm90,"Dear freshmen,","A message from my friend with not enough karma:

“Please stop asking about schedules/courses.

I know you guys are freshman and are worried about maintaining a good GPA but college is about learning independence. The point of freshman year is to make decisions for yourself and learn about yourself and grow as a person. Your first year in college, you will run into difficulties, and you have to learn to manage it. 

Asking if 3 STEM class is manageable is a silly question. You know yourself better than we know you. If you are willing to put in the effort and time, you will be fine. If you don't think you can manage your time correctly, maybe take less STEM and explore other interests. Stop worrying if a particular class will be challenging, if it's a prerequisite class, you're going to take it eventually.

All in all, most classes will be hard. You will need to put in enough effort to do well in your classes.”

It’s crazy and surprising to see so much variety but I can’t help but realize that how much it can pigeonhole people to hang out with only their own ethnic groups.

7lqs7s,"Applying as a transfer student to CS, have lots of questions","So I currently go to a four-year state school on the east coast (nothing prestigious) and am interested in transferring to UW for CS. I feel that I'm not challenged at my current university. It's a huge party school and that's not really my scene. As pretentious and elitist as it sounds, I feel diosyapointed in myself for attending a university with the kind of people that attend my current school. Thus, I want to attend a university with excellent academics and a strong CS program.

Anyways, I applied to transfer last semester for aerospace engineering, and was rejected. I was a mechanical engineering major at the point and believed that I was interested in doing aerospace engineering. I have since switched to CS since I don't really want to be doing stress analyses for the rest of my life and am more interested in CS anyways. Since I switched majors, I am a freshman in terms of my major, so I am planning on transferring to UW as a sophomore. I selected to apply directly into the major as a transfer student, since I will have pretty much all of the prerequisites done (see questions below).

My GPA is much better this semester (~3.8/3.9 this past semester, 3.5 the semester before that, and a 3.0 my first year) after switching to CS. I think part of this that I decided I would give pre-med a shot, and that has given me the motivation to push for a 4.0. Without pre-med, my mindset was that I'd be able to get a job right out of college with my degree and work experience, and that I'd be fine with anything above a 3.0. Thus, there wasn't any motivation for pursue a higher GPA and that I could put in the minimum amount of work and get above a 3.0. But now I've proven to myself that I can get a good GPA!

Anyways, here are my questions:

1.  Unfortunately, my calculus courses did not cover double integrals or a few of the topics that MATH 126 covers. This shouldn't be a problem, should it? Luckily our intro to CS courses also cover Java, so they should count as CS 142 and 143. 

2. How competitive is it to transfer directly into CS as an out of state student (I put down informatics as my second major)? I have decent ECs (IMO) and a decent GPA (at least from this past semester). While I think that applying to UW and not applying for CS directly may be easier admissions wise, I don't want to be stuck with having nothing to do for a semester while I wait to apply for CS once I'm there (if that makes sense). Is that concern valid?

3. It shouldn't be an issue that I applied for a different major last year and was rejected, would it? One of the things I'm planning to address the fact that I keep switching majors in my essay, and say how switching to CS gives me the potential to take part in all of these industries that I might be interested in.

4. I'm currently a pre-med student, but I'll probably drop this if I transfer to UW to focus on CS, since I imagine the courses will be much harder and I won't have as much time to spare on taking pre-med prerequisites. Plus, I don't think I'm that interested in health anyways, now that I'm interested in doing CS. Should I mention the fact that I'm a pre-med student in my application? I'm worried that saying I will drop it in pursuit of CS is a red flag.

5. Is it okay to re-use passages from my essay from my last application? There are a few passages that I am proud of and are still accurate today that I am interested in using.

6. Is there anything like a student-run angel investing fund on campus? I'm pretty involved with one at my school currently, but, as much as I love what we do, I don't want it to be the only thing that keeps me at my current university. I'd love to participate in one at UW (if I get in).

7. The application says that I'll need to submit an application for my major along with the transfer application since I'm applying directly to the major. But, the CS school website says that students do not need to submit a separate application. Which is true?

xjpj0e,Is UofWa actually toxic?,"Hi all,

So as an incoming transfer student, I have heard absolute HORROR stories about UofWa being extremely toxic, especially in the STEM field, which I so happen to be in. My sister attended here and even said that her ""friends"" were hesitant to help her because they feared she would get a better score than them

However, despite just finding this out, I'm worried, to say the least. I want to be in a community where everyone can help each other and be able to ask questions without feeling less-than. I don't want to be a part of a culture where I feel the need to constantly compete with my friends and peers. I want a supportive community where I'm able to be vulnerable when I truly don't understand something and ask for help.

If anyone has experienced this, please comment on some good ways to block out this certain culture. I want my college experience to be fun, not competitive. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/xjpj0e/is_uofwa_actually_toxic/,36,12

1bv58ns,UCSB vs UW Seattle,"I am stuck between UCSB vs UW Seattle. I got into UCSB for Pre-Economics & Accounting, and UW Seattle as a Direct Admit to the Foster School of business. I am a California Resident but cost isn't that much of an issue.

**School: UCSB Vs UW**

US News Rank: 35 Vs 40

Acceptance Rate: 29% Vs 46%

Total Cost Per Year: 40k Vs 60k (oos)

Location: Beach Town Vs Big City

Student-Faculty Ratio: 17:1 Vs 21:1

Overall, UCSB appears better in every meaningful statistic, however, the specific program is what I am more curious about. In 2023, UW Foster's starting salary for undergrads was 76.6k in 2023 with a 94% placement after 3 months, and the average signing bonus was 8.5k. This makes it significantly better than UW overall.

On the other hand, UCSB Pre-Economics & Accounting major has very little data available online and feels like a bit more of a gamble. Does anyone have any data on UCSB accounting major? I am leaning towards Foster since their MBA is ranked 20th on US news (which is still relevant to the undergraduate program) and since I have concrete data on outcomes. Some data on UCSB's accounting/econ program and any possible first-hand experience would be super helpful before making a decision.

Extra: I have also been waitlisted by Michigan and UCSD and was wondering how they would stack up in case I am offered a spot.

I want to apply for direct admission to Comp sci, because I initially heard that if you don't get into the major, they won't reject you because of it.

If this is the case, wouldn't it be better to decide on something that doesn't require direct admit (ex. Informatics, which I would be more than willing to do) if I don't have a stellar chance at majoring in CS? I would also like to know my chances of getting into UW in general.

Math 125 (124 done from AP credit)

Phys 121

ESS 106 (Wanted an easier class to round out my schedule)

EFIG stuff

I heard M125 and P121 are weedout classes, is it a bad idea to take them both first quarter or will it be manageable but hard?

82lerk,"Is 13"" laptop too small (School vs. Work)","I was in here a few weeks ago inquiring about laptop needs for the Foster School. Now I am back because I checked out some 13"" ultrabooks (Dell XPS 13, Macbook, & Macbook Pro) and realized how small 13 inches is. I am used to a 17"" gaming laptop and dual 27"" monitors.

My plan was to get a top-of-the-line ultrabook that I would use for the two years at Foster then at least two more at my job (currently aiming for general manager). 13 inches looked too small for good productivity though. I wouldn't be able to have two windows open (such as Word + a PDF). I'm thinking 13"" is a better size for school because of the reduced weight and for fitting onto small classroom desks, but for work, with a real desk, 15"" seems much more productive.

Does you guys share your good and bad experiences with 13"" and larger laptops at school?

The smallness of a 13"" laptop is making me think I should get a cheaper 13"" laptop for the two years in business school, then upgrade to a high-end 15""+ once I have a real job.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/82lerk/is_13_laptop_too_small_school_vs_work/,8,0

- Internship doing CS at a national lab
- Volunteered at local library
- Did club swim for a billion years

1ugv1z,CAREFUL!!! faulty UW software is misleading,"Be very careful not to rely on the General Education Requirement Course Search tool located in the student guide at:

http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/genedinq.html

This software is extremely easy to use. However, its yet another piece of poorly-written UW software released without testing or any indication that it doesn't really work. 

Though Academic advising says it locates all open courses, it misses many open UW courses. It doesn't locate any open online courses which fit just about anyone's schedule, or open courses where the professors don't specify times and puts ""to be arranged"". Often, these professors will arrange days and times that all students can attend later or will work out with students when to meet. These are among the best courses at the UW since they are usually small with very caring professors. 

You can find some of the UW's online courses at

http://www.pce.uw.edu/online-learning/

This probably isn't all of them. 

Again, beware of this tool. You'll miss hundreds of UW classes that might be perfert for you if you use it. Instead, use your advisor and the ENTIRE UW list at:

Edit: I think I have to re-iterate. I’m not asking that we go fully in-person in the Fall, and nor am I asking that every sub-50 student class goes in-person. I’m asking that the current time schedule stands, and I think it’s very very likely since few classes are fully in-person. I have no idea if UW plans to add more classes to the in-person list before Fall, and not sure if that’d be wise. It’s perfectly fine how it stands, no reason to go fully online every damn quarter until we have 0 cases.

I do a lot of theater at school and is a drama officer. I wrote my optional essay about how much I love theater and what I love about it. I also do DECA on the side too my senior year.

I think my biggest strength is my Pokémon card business during covid that has helped me make over $10k and learn about marketing.

rwgzpw,Two of my thoughts that seem to be controversial on this subreddit.,"1. Speak out and advocate for yourself. Roommate didn't clean up after themselves, person hogging the sidewalk, or somebody occupying the middle seat in a three seat couch? Call them out on it instead of being passive aggressive about it and hoping that'll get the point across. In any relationship, even with strangers, communication is key, instead of letting things reach a boiling point for yourself or the other person.

2. A person's past actions don't define who they are today. If I could shoot the person I was 10, or hell, even 5 years back, I would out of absolute disgust, but that's what we as humans do- we evolve from our mistakes and change over time. Critiquing somebody for things they did or opinions they held years back vs who they are today seems wrong- we should be able to look past that.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/rwgzpw/two_of_my_thoughts_that_seem_to_be_controversial/,5,19

- GPA 3.2 ( pandemic freshman year basically failed but had 4.0, 3.5+ grades ever since) 
- Associates Degree/Running Start 
- 4 AP/honors classes when I was in the high school
- Publicity manager of FCCLA club for a single year before I did running start 
- Vice president of PTK Honors Honors society at the Community College I attend for two years 
- Senior class Treasurer in ASB (1yr) 
- Basketball for two years 
- Varsity Lacrosse for three years 
- Work part time at a small business for two years 
- No ACT/SAT 
- First Gen college student 
- Mixed race (White/Pacific Islander/Asian) 
- Low Income house hold

I’m really nervous because this has been my dream for a long time but the school gets more and more selective each year, and I feel like my stats are all over the place- like I’m not consistently great at one thing so they’ll reject me. so lmk what you guys think, possible or pipe dream? 

Also in my personal statement I was going to mention how I actually work two jobs under the table because the state would take my families food benefits if I worked legitimately…..

9th grade:

English I Honors
Biology Honors

Chemistry Honors

(Community College) Physics for non-science majors (this was the only class available for me at the time)
(Community College) US History II and American Government
(Community College) Intro to 3D computer animation 
AP Language and Composition

12th grade:

AP Literature
AP Studio Art
AP Computer Science A
AP Calculus AB

Also, since I haven’t taken my 12th grade schedule plan just yet (I’m still a Junior), I could theoretically switch my remaining two classes (I didn’t list them but they are Intro to Game Design and Engineering Ia and Ib) to college Physics which I could then take online as a Running Start student.

ao8p3g,Message From Ana Mari Cauce,"Dear UW Community, 

We are all in shock and sadness over the death of a UW student after a tragic fall on the Seattle campus yesterday. I have spoken with the student’s father and my heart is with her grieving family and friends and all who knew her. 

This was a tragic accident, one that is felt very personally by me and all the UW staff who work to keep our campus safe, every day. Resources for anyone who needs support can be found in the links below. 

The decision to operate or suspend operations on our campus during inclement weather is ultimately my responsibility. It is made after careful assessment and deliberations with our facilities managers and the safety of our campus community is always the determining factor. By Wednesday, we determined that campus operations could resume. It is important to note that as a public, residential space, our campus is never “closed” and that there will always be people on the grounds. Our crews work around the clock to keep our campus roads and sidewalks as clear of snow and ice as possible, regardless of whether normal operations are suspended. 

With more snow in the forecast, we are already assessing campus conditions — the safety of our community will continue to be our priority. If you know of or become aware of places on campus where additional clearing or signage is needed, UW Facilities asks that you contact their customer care team to identify areas to service. I also encourage everyone to sign up for UW Alerts for updates and notifications about campus safety. 

The weather conditions we are experiencing are unusual and challenging for Seattle due to the combination of snow and below-freezing temperatures that prevent a full melt. Please take extra precautions, move a little slower, have patience with delays and watch out for your friends and colleagues. 

Please do know that we are doing, and will continue to do, all that we can to keep you and all who visit our campus as safe as possible. 

Sincerely,


Ana Mari Cauce

gutu4d,LETS BE REAL UW,"I love UW and honestly do not regret the choice of calling UW as my home because I made so many great friends, met amazing professors, and great memories formed at UW. However, I do not understand why UW is still asking students for full tuition when all the learning is done at home without getting any access to the facilities provided by UW. UW President is making millions of bucks by the way which I do not understand why they feel the necessity to leech off of us for the full tuition. Also, times like this, I think the acamdeia people need to reconsider about the upcoming finals for this quarter. I am not using the protest as an excuse to pass on the finals but more of can you guys for once be realistic and take the side of the students and the things we are going through. This protest is effecting many of us and I know that times are not easy for everyone to be in the right state of mind to push through school. One of my friend I know wanted to part of the peaceful protest but she realized she has classes to pass and had to pass up. I know as a student academic is important but this protest is more than just Floyd's death. It is fighting for justice and the mistreatment happening in the society for so many years and this is the time to put the government back in its right place and have them stop treating working and middle class like shit. All my thoughts and prayers are out there fighting for justice on the street and I hope that everyone stays safe and hope we get justice. 

So please UW, please hear out the students and please be a little bit more humane. Thanks",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/gutu4d/lets_be_real_uw/,4,9

e8j1vn,Stop whining and handle it like an adult,"I mean seriously guys. I understand if youre feeling bad about not being prepared or simply not understanding course material for finals, but unless youre paying for your classes all by yourself, not taking a final or putting in 100% of your effort is not an option. It doesnt matter if you do poorly, but giving up is the easy way out especially if someone else is paying for your education. 

I would feel fucking horrible if my parents were paying for my tuition and then not putting in all the effort I can. There are soooo many other people who wish they could be here but cant because of financial issues. Some people need to grow up and make smarter decisions. 

And im not saying im perfect. I slack off and procrastinate but I have never considered not taking a final or doing all that I could to get a good grade and understand the course material. (PS: I pay for my education by working and scholarships not one penny comes from my parents). 

Just a lil rant, I know its finals time but everyone is going through stress studying and depression in extreme cases. Dont give up",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/e8j1vn/stop_whining_and_handle_it_like_an_adult/,9,0

Interlake,  Newport, International and Big Picture hugely outperformed other  schools in the area. International was the clear leader with \~70% of  seniors getting an admit. On the other hand in LWSD, Tesla STEM school  fared poorly vs. last year, although LWSD was clear #2 in the state.

since i was like 10, ive wanted to go to uw for computer science but when i actually did some research into uw’s cse program it seems kinda bad. i mainly want to do something in the software engineering or game design scene but i heard that uw seattles program is mainly oriented towards research and not practical coding. am i just completely wrong? for anyone thats gone through the allen school for cse could you give me a little run down of how your experience was and what u came out learning from it? 

I read a little about the uw bothell program and it seems more about programming and exploring career paths in coding. obviously id rather go to uws if there program is the same tho.

another option too is to just go to a different university like western washing university which also seems more about programming as a whole.

I also heard a little bit about possibly going to the school of information and pursuing an informatics major. it seems to me that its just about user interface and improving media apps but again i could be completely wrong. if someone wants to touch up on that it would be super helpful. 

i guess what im trying to say is is uws cse program good for software engineering? or is it probably in my best interest to go to another school that may be more focused on programming? thanks redditors :^)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/de60db/cse_program_vs_informatics/,28,0

The big kicker: I’m a novelist: wrote and published a book on Amazon about a young girl breaking into the STEM field (inspired by my experiences in Robotics); garnered nine International #1 Best Seller Badges on Amazon (10, 11, 12)

Personal Statement Essay was about how the faith of my 4th grade teacher pushed me far beyond primary school to try out for Robotics and eventually led me to write a children’s book about my experiences. Starts a little cliche but is def somewhat interesting.

osufuo,"Rant: Convinced UW will Rescind ""No Mask Requirement"" for fall","[First, here's a CDC study about the effectiveness of vaccination.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7013e3-H.pdf)

Now that the CDC is recommending ""universal masking for teachers, staff, students and visitors in schools, regardless of vaccination status and community transmission of the virus"" I'm planning to take fall quarter off.

I've followed the science, I've masked up, I've gotten vaccinated.  I've returned to not wearing a mask. 

But then this dropped.

But now I'm tired of these masks, I'm tired of the isolation, I'm tired of the fear, I don't expect I'll return to the devoted quarantining that I practiced for the past 16 months.  I've had an incredibly hard time staying motivated in my coursework with this whole ""remote learning"" fiasco. 

I've been vaccinated.  *We've* all been vaccinated.  We will not be able to attend classes unless we attest that we are vaccinated.  Does the vaccine work or doesn't it?  Who are we, the vaccinated, protecting?  Am I supposed to wear a mask so that if I get COVID, I'm protecting the anti-vaxxers?  Not worth it in my mind.

No more gym w/o a mask?  No library without a mask?  We're going to go back to all of that?  No thanks.  I'd rather opt out of fall quarter.  If it's so dangerous, classes should still be remote, anyways.  This is not worth the *massive* amount of money I'm paying for this bullshit college experience.

From the CDC: “In rare occasions, some vaccinated people infected with a Delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others.”

Sure, I get it.  But this is no longer our pandemic.  As the Director of the CDC said, this is now a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” But she's worried that ""vaccinated people who are in a place with substantial or high transmission could contract a breakthrough infection, and could pass the virus onto unvaccinated family members or those with weakened immune systems and others most at risk.""  Not my problem.  I'm vaccinated.  You're vaccinated.  I'm not going to give it to you.  You're not going to give it to me.

And now that I've written this incredibly self-centered post, I still see the importance of protecting those that are vulnerable, including the IDIOTS that have just decided not to get vaccinated.  So, I guess I'll see you all on campus.  But you won't be able to tell I'm grumpy, cause my frown will be covered.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/osufuo/rant_convinced_uw_will_rescind_no_mask/,68,131

izn6iy,Math Placement for 120,"Hello all

I've applied to UW for Winter 2021, but am preparing to take the Self Guided Math Placement so I can be ready to take MATH 120 on my first quarter.

Currently, I'm working through Khan Academy and doing pretty well (I'm working through Algebra II and will probably work on Precalc if I have time -- I like maths!). My question to you all is are there resources where I can get a 'practice' test? I know that UW has a couple of sources for review which I will probably use if nothing else, but they have the answers directly next to the questions which kinda makes it difficult. 

I've taken practice Accuplacer tests and I'm nearly 100% confident that I've studied enough to get a half-decent score, but I'm not sure how well these translate. I'm also not sure if I'm able to retake the Self Guided Math Placement before I start UW (acceptance permitting) in case I end up in a lower class than I had hoped. 

TL;DR 

-- Are there any resources with an actual test practice that are similar to the Self Guided Math Placement, or are the resources on UW my best option?

-- Can I retake the Self Guided Math Placement before taking a maths class if I'm unhappy with my placement?

Thanks in advance!

I am currently taking Math 308, PHYS 121, and AFRAM 337 and research credits. I'm a Freshman applying to Computer Science this summer.  I did poorly on the first 308 midterm and I think at best I could get a 3.3.   My other classes have been: Math 125: 3.8, Math 126: 3.7, CSE 142/143: 3.8/4.0 ENGL 111: 4.0, ENGR 115: 4.0.  Will having the W on my transcript be more detrimental than having a grade around a 3.3 for Math 308 (best case scenario)?  It's been hard adjusting to online classes so it makes me think that an admissions committee wouldn't really care as much if you had a late drop in Spring quarter.

dwnj3s,Should I apply for the Honors program at UW?,"Hi! I'm applying for freshman admission this year and had some questions regarding the Honors Program. You might think that I'm a bit late since the deadline for applying is just hours away. But I got to know about this program a few minutes ago :(

What I've understood from their website is that it is an interdisciplinary program for students interested in more than one majors. Correct me if I'm wrong, as I think I don't understand what it is. 

I'm applying for Electrical Engineering (first choice) and Computer Engineering (second choice). I'm interested in Brain-Machine Interfaces and might work on them in future. This will require knowledge in other fields like Neuroscience, Material Science etc. 

Do you think I should apply for the honors program? Also, will applying for the honors program affect the chances of my admission into UW. I saw a video in which they said: ""admission into the honours program is contingent on admission into UW"". I don't understand what that means. 

Stats (if they matter)

SAT: 800 Math ([UW only looks at Math scores of International Applicants](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/how-to-apply/#test-scores))

School doesn't give a GPA, but I rank around 50-100 in a class of 900 with the percentage I get each year.

I have pretty good ECs: robotics and aerospace projects, along with awards at International Robotics Competitions and a few competitions at NASA (can't go into more details to maintain anonymity).

That is just an example, but there are more.

&#x200B;

78hy7r,UW International Student Application,"Hello everyone! 

I am an international student applying to the University of Washington from Russia. I have a few things to clarify, and I am convinced that this is an appropriate place because some of my questions are specifically about UW.

Major: International Relations/Political Science.

Here are some stats: 
1. Ethnicity: Russian. I believe it might help because there are very few (if any) Russian at the University of Washington. Here comes diversity. 
2. GPA: I believe it is something around 4.6-4.7/5.0 (on 5 scale). I attend very rigorous school in my country, so it is really hard to be a stellar student, taking into account that everyone is obliged to follow a national curriculum. Anyway, GPA is probably within the range of acceptance. 
3. TOEFL. I have got 85 overall, with 28 out of 30 on the Writing section. Some of you might say that it is not that much, but I personally believe that it is quite good; UW requires the minimum of 76, so I am okay on this requirement. I have also taken IELTS, and I have scored 6.5 overall. Still not sure which one to send. 
4. SAT. I have had a bad experience taking the SAT exam because I am not used to such system. I mean, it was quite hard to do 60 problems in like 60 minutes. No way. You would say it is all about strategies and time-management, but those who say these things were educated in the US and they were taught these things (the way things are teacher in every country is different, just saying). Well, I scored 1060, which is above the national average (and I should be proud of myself because many U.S. students did worse than I did). I have not studied for it, by the way. Of course, you must think that I am very dumb, but this is who I am. Yes, I did badly on the test, but I am very industrious, willing to work and passionate. It is just not the way I should be judged. And here is the thing: UW does not require SAT/ACT for international admission. I am taking ACT just for a change (maybe, it will be better). But I do not really plan to send it to the UW. 
5. Essays: I have done a good job writing my essays. They are almost completed. I assume they are quite good, but I also don't have a explicit idea what I am expected to write about, though. 
6. ECs: Not much to say about it. In Russia, the priority is given to academics, so we do not really have any clubs, organizations, volunteering, etc. Nonetheless, I have done some things outside the classroom. First of all, I have served as Steam Community Translator @ Valve Software translating Valve games into Russian. I was some kind of leader when it came to proofreading Russian translations. It is so because I had the deepest understanding of how the Russian language was structured. Secondly, I have participated in many All-Russian Olympiads in Social Sciences (Law, Russian History, Sociology, Russian, English). I have done pretty well on them, and they are really rigorous. I guess it is worth mentioning on my college application. Secondly, I have been playing as a goalkeeper for a local soccer team. We are not really good, but since the US college want to see that you are active, I guess it is worth telling them that I am also sporty. I might also mention that I am a participant of the UN Model. So, am I good in terms of ECs? 

Please chance me for the UW based on the information above. Thank you in advance. 

Here are few questions that concern me: 
1. Why UW does not require SAT for international students? Does it mean that they are basically cash cows and they are treated this way? I do not think that is cool.
2. Will I be able to find any job in the United States after graduation if I major in International Relations or Political Science? Provided that I also speak Russian fluently and + one more foreign language. My main goal is to stay in the US, so it is really important. I do not mind hearing from international students, and I would especially appreciate your responses. 
3. How is the school overall? Tell me your experience. 

Thank you for your attention and patience.

Looking at the honors physics 121-123 details, it looks like it would be a lot more enjoyable, with smaller class sizes, better instructors, and a focus on quantum mechanics and relativity. Can anyone who has taken it talk about the difficulty and workload of it compared to the normal classes?

I also have the problem of admission to the EE department that I want to sort out. I want to apply ASAP, and the science pre-requisites are CHEM 142, and PHYS 121/122. Honors physics only runs in a specific order from Autumn to Spring quarters, which means that I can't take CHEM 142 first quarter. If I take chemistry Spring quarter, then I lose priority registration for PHYS 123 in Autumn of the next year, and I also can't do honors for the last section. However, this lets me apply to EE by the end of freshman year. I could also take two science classes in one quarter, but I've read around here that it is a very bad idea to try that. On the other hand, if I take all of honors physics during freshman year, and take chemistry in fall of sophomore year, I can get all of the classes I want, but it delays the application date. This worries me, due to the possibility of having to re-apply several times if my GPA is too low, and it's cutting it close to the beginning of the major-specific courses.

uawj5h,New thrifting app for UW students !,"I stumbled across a QR code on campus the other day and found out about Thrifthouse which is an app made by some MIT students that allows you to sell your clothes, shoes, textbooks, appliances, etc. to other students at your college campus. You need to log in with your student ID and everything so it is very secure and only reaches other UW students. It makes selling shit so easy because you don’t have to package and ship out your item like you would for Depop. You just need to meet up at like paccar or ode and that it. Anyway I’ve been using the app for awhile and have been selling stuff here and there just because the creators of the app sometimes give you free money to spend on the app as an incentive to buy and sell things. The only thing is, as with any startup, not a lot of people know about the app so there’s not many new items being sold or even being listed on the app on a weekly basis. 

So I am here to tell all of y’all to GET THRIFTHOUSE. 

I feel like this app has the potential to be a mainstream UW student app just because it’s so convenient and allows you to make a few bucks if your moving out and trying to get rid of things. Anyway, if any of you guys are interested here’s the link:) I feel like I’m an ambassador or something but I swear I actually just love the concept of this app so much.

I was interested in taking an intro class of a different study than my major.  Turns out it was a ""weed out"" class (this is my first quarter).  They really showed me.  I'll never explore my academic interests again.  I was one of the few people who got As in it and I had no life for 3 months in order to do it.  It wasn't even useful learning 80% of the time, it was like learning a rubix's cube version of information you already knew so you could do well on a bunch of trick questions.  Such a waste of time.  At the last college I was at I had extra time to read literature and philosophy.  I was creative and was always growing intellectually.  After 2 quarters here, with a 4.0gpa, I actually feel stupider.  No wonder UW has never produced a Nobel prize winning writer or some great innovator in their field like the real top-tier schools.

1bzciqi,Idea: Be nice to the people you want to convince,"EDIT: I am making the exact same mistake, the title is ironically a lesson I should listen to. The original post was a cathartic angry release and it was more about me feeling better than addressing the audience (""HUB vandals"", etc). 

Especially w/Gaza war and killing, it's too much death to wrap your head around and I think that it is probably unleashing shock/defensiveness/cognitive dissonance worldwide. I got in my own way by just indulging in being pissed and I respectfully do believe vandals did as well.

It is much easier to cross the bridge and change your mind (political opinion, etc) when the other person is inviting you in with open arms. I have been in the situation of needing to change before and you can psychologically feel the difference between when ""agreeing"" is framed as ""defeat"" and when it's ""joining your friends to do the right thing"".

I know that it is possible to get ourselves out of the way (vandals, reactionaries, me yapping and malding etc) and keep keep keep telling the people we know about all the bombing and killing in Gaza. It should be impossible to ignore.

This is exactly why I was writing about ""being careful about how we do it"". I think that it's important to be measured in your activism because you can appeal to people's emotions, beliefs etc without inviting pride, defensiveness, ego etc to the door.

This is one of those massively important and sickening historical events, and as a consequence it is so easy to frame as something to get on board with rather than using shame or force. We are very lucky to not have to use force in our situation.

I believe you (vandals) are righteous motherfuckers... you make me think about how much I'm willing to be uncomfortable... AND I think the expression of that has impacts; you can certainly see them below.

ORIGINAL POST:

This is addressed to ""the HUB vandals"", to distinguish between those who were trying to show the world the horrible truth about Gaza, and those who were ideologically masturbating with Sharpies.

Israel's reputation thrives off being known as the ""orderly security force"", as opposed to the ""frothing radical Palestinian terrorists"". This is a lie. Regardless, western media, American politicians, and the public are looking closely for examples.

This is an unfair box to be put in. You cannot be complacent sign-holders, and at the same time, you cannot be window-breakers. Civil disobedience is the remedy, this is a PERFECT opportunity for a sit-in. The cause needs the attention.

You can really tell how much someone gives a shit by how much they're willing to decenter themselves. And it seems that some of you really hate your audience. Yelling at reporters, slinging slurs, etc. Openly harassing anyone who came to PUBLICIZE YOUR DEMONSTRATION. (The goal)

When directly offered media attention... by the THE STATE-SPONSORED UNIVERSITY NEWSPAPER... which was going to show up, and has the largest audience... you cut off your nose to spite your face, and decided the Daily was ""too liberal"". And now the people you yelled at have a statement out about how much you yelled at them.

The vandalism is the perfect example. You could have covered the HUB wall to wall in flyers, communicated just as well, and then you would have had plenty of photos of UW staff taking them down. The cause gets the attention for longer, the administration has less to slander you with. You GAIN ATTENTION and SYMPATHY (support. for the cause. remember the cause?) at the cost of IMMEDIATE CATHARTIC RELEASE.

These choices were clearly made to show that ""the movement"" would not be moderated or constrained by authority. These are choices of ideological purists, tribalist book-thumpers, self-interested folks.

Have you noticed how protestors in worse circumstances-- PALESTINIANS, FOR EXAMPLE-- seem to be chiefly interested in impact, effect, and visibility? There is no armed struggle to wage on Red Square, so surely you are responsible for crafting the most-heard protest, not the most-strong.

There is NO EITHER-OR CHOICE between ""caring about optics"" and ""denouncing civilian carpet-bombing"", actually, and Lenin's spirit is not judging you from the sky. 

How can you so desperately want power and refuse to level with your audience? 1960s revolutionaries knew how to strategize to defeat the Western media machine, you guys just seem to know how to get mad. To those stubborn leftists who are putting themselves before their cause, I hope you are ignored in the public square for as long as you can't figure out how to accept what you can't control. 

(If you are unfamiliar with the killing in Gaza, you ought not to be hated for it, and you are welcome under the umbrella of protecting innocent life. The Wikipedia page for the ""Israel–Hamas war"", while Westernized, is a much better picture of the situation than what American news media will promote)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bzciqi/idea_be_nice_to_the_people_you_want_to_convince/,7,40

2. Is it really manageable to maintain a 3.5+ GPA in UW?

bgmdlp,Is competing for CS worth a shot in my case?,"I'm a freshman applicant and current student at SPSCC. I have a 3.9 GPA, 4.0 in STEM prereqs, iamverysmart, etc. etc. I want to study computer science. However, I have been rejected from a number of CS programs, including DTM CS at UW.

My choices have boiled down to:

- UW (Seattle):
Pros: Can actually compete for majors. Seattle is the best location for me personally.
Cons: No guarantees.

- UCSD:
Pros: Backup majors are tier 2. To not call them top-tier is splitting hairs. Location is ideal for career.
Cons: CS transfer admissions are literally random. Once you pass the cutoff GPA, you have no influence.

- WSU:
Pros: They'll let me study CS
Cons: They're WSU. I don't think I need to say more here. :) I've lived in Pullman. It's not the greatest place for me.

Going to WSU seems silly. Shade-throwing aside, they'll eat me up should I decide transfer out of either UCSD or UW, so picking one first makes sense. So the question is then: Should I just settle on a backup and make the best of it at UCSD, or try my hand at pre-CS at UW?

P.S.: Tried to keep the bragging to a minimum, but it seems exceptionally relevant to my projected performance that I have about a decade hobby/open-source experience in CS/software engineering.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/bgmdlp/is_competing_for_cs_worth_a_shot_in_my_case/,37,4

70inew,What are my chances of getting into UW (NOT Trolling),"I had posted about this before, but I'd like to go a little more in depth.

So I royally screwed up when I was in high school. I graduated in 2009, but my final GPA was 2.6.

Anywhew, for a litany of reasons (mainly alcohol/drug abuse and major depressive disorder), I continued my terrible academic streak with a stint at a state college in Connecticut, where I am originally from.   

I ended up essentially skipping out on all my classes for one semester, and did not return.

I just looked at my old transcript from this school, and I received one F, three W's (withdraws), and one N (never attended). 

That was in 2010.

In spring of 2016, after living in Washington for a year, I decided to give college a more serious go. I am two quarters away from finishing my DTA Associates Degree from Whatcom Community College, I currently have a **4.0 GPA** and plan on keeping it until I transfer. 


 Obviously I plan to elaborate on why my High school and early college careers were such disasters, I was attending rehabilitation for a period in high school, my parents divorced, mother diagnosed with cancer, general angsty teen stuff.... constantly struggling to maintain a sense of well being. 

I plan on highlighting my strengths in my application as well, duh.

 I don't want to bore you too much with them, so I'll be brief:

Basically around 2012 I started working for a high profile entertainment promotions/marketing company named ""Celebrity Access"". I worked there for 4 years, was promoted to Tour Date Manager after the first year. This was essentially the type of career that a Com major like myself seeks. In other words, I have already worked in the field. 

I began to realize that it was possible to make it without a college degree, however the further I went in the field the more I recognized the importance of having a formal college education. These days, you are always given more opportunities when you have that badge under your belt. 

That being said, I eventually left the job on good terms, to travel the country and find the right school, eventually finding myself in Washington state. 

Its been a roller coaster ride, but I am hoping that UW will see the stark contrast between my academic record as a kid, and my academic record now as a 26 year old. It truly is a night and day difference. 

What do you think my chances are of getting into UW?

Has anyone been in this situation before? If so, please share!

Do you think they will seriously take into account my first college stint when configuring my ""transfer GPA""? I don't think W's and N's can be taken into account, meaning the one F may be the only grade to potentially transfer (and haunt me). But come on! I've got a 4.0 now... 

Obviously there are a lot more things I could tell you about myself (volunteer work, passions, etc), but I think you get the gist. 

Edit - oh, and yes, around the age of 22 I did in fact take control of my own life. I do not drink or take drugs anymore. At 26, I can 100% say that I am the happiest I have ever been, more focused than ever!

b0c4ev,"To the girl loudly ""complaining"" in class about her worry of getting a 4.0 or 3.9","I get it. You worked hard all quarter and you want to maybe do a little bit of gloating about it. But doing so in a classroom full of people who are struggling to just pass the class with a 2.0... that's not cool. I know you're a freshman, but I can only hope for your sake that you learn the difference between *gaining an education* and *earning a degree* before you graduate. This isn't high school anymore. Grades aren't everything. Grades don't make a person. Grades are not an accurate measure of the skills and capacity of a person.  And to top it off by ostentatiously boasting about yours in a class full of struggling freshmen, many of whom might be first-generation college students, or students away from their home with little-to-no support structure? Do everyone a favor and brag to your parents or your friends instead, not loudly during class, repeatedly throughout the quarter.


Edit: My intent in this post was not to make leaping, unfounded accusations about the original student not being a first-generation student or being disadvantaged in someway herself. It was to illustrate the point that there are people who might be disadvantaged from circumstances outside their control who could become discouraged and on top of that because they’re not doing well. I also wasn’t meaning to attribute their success to something outside of their own work ethic and drive. 

Edit2: Since everyone is assuming I’m jealous: I’m not. I have a 4.0 as well. I just don’t agree with bragging openly at the risk of discouraging other people who aren’t doing as well. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/b0c4ev/to_the_girl_loudly_complaining_in_class_about_her/,55,145

1ryb8e,The future of the University of Washington?,"Hey Huskies,

I had an interesting conversation with a recruiter at Amazon (UW Alum), and she was talking a lot about the computer science program here at the UW, how it is amazing, but recently some professors are leaving (she mentioned a name and said he is a very popular researcher in the field, just don't recall the professors name) to other universities such as Stanford, or other elite schools. I myself am a freshman here at the UW, majoring in CSE, but after this convo with the recruiter, it is making me think, how is the UW doing right now? I know it is ranked top 50, or even 16th in some rankings, but as a school, is it doing better? or is it doing worse than previous years? This years incoming freshman class was the largest, so I'd imagine this is a good sign?

The university is constantly expanding, and for such a HUGE university, it is quite impressive how laid out the programs are here (excluding registration hehe). I was accepted to top CSE programs too (Columbia, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley) but I choose the UW mainly because of it being located in Seattle, as I want to be apart of the giant startup scene, and of course, it is a top 10 school in the field. But even with that aside, is the UW progressing in terms of being better? or is it really falling behind? 

Sorry for rambling and probably being redundant, I've been studying for finals, and figured it would be awesome to hear more from other huskies about this topic, as I definitely feel the university is heading towards the right path...

We're at the early stages of developing a doc management app to increase efficiency in a workspace by decreasing the amount of steps and time people have to look for their important documents. We're currently on our alpha stage, and would love feedbacks!

What are we looking for? We're looking to recruit 15 (> 23+) grad students who were or are freelancers, mid-late stage startup leaders, or dealing with clients, ideally with pain points in managing documents on Google Drive and Slack, to help us test the app. Volunteers will be testing the app during their free times throughout the alpha stage (beta will be released sometime in February 2021) and will be asked to give feedback once a week. If you find value in the app, we would love for you to continue throughout our product stages! In return, users joining during our exclusive alpha stage will get free access to our beta product, as we will be planning to charge people for beta!

Hey there, r/udub. I'm torn. So, I'm an incoming freshman and I'm still deciding between where to go for university, and it's down to UW and UBC (yes, that UBC in Vancouver). I'd be majoring in Environmental Sciences in both schools, and they both seem to be strong in that. Cost wise, I'd be considered out of state/international (I'm coming from Maryland, so distance and travel costs are about the same) and UBC is a bit cheaper given the exchange rate, but UW did give me money all four years. So my costs would be like 39k comprehensive UBC vs 43k comprehensive for UW. And between the two cities, I like them both enough. Anyone else had a similar choice to make, and how did you make that?

I support saving all civilians, both Israel and Palestine, but fuck both Hamas and Benjamin (Israel PM) - Both elected governments and head of states are corrupted to its core and both sides of their civilians should elect a new government 

I support neither/rather not say - Pretty much you shut your mouth about this or don't have a final opinion yet

Ah shit here we go again - Another broken ceasefire for the 66th gazillion time and more human suffering that both sides blame each other for

9jtjzj,"Anybody living in Stevens Court J, K, L, M","Hello, 
I am a female, living in Stevens Court A, it's a 2nd floor 6 bedroom apartment, 9 months lease. I want to switch to a room in Stevens Court J, K, L, or M.

I know the A building is much older and you are thinking, ""why should I swap rooms with you?"". Reasons you may want to switch are: 

* you live on the ground floor and feel unsafe opening the window  for fresh air. If you swap rooms with me, you can open the window with no worry of someone breaking into the room.
* you live on the ground floor and feel hesitant to open the blinds for light because people will see into your room. If you swap rooms with me, you can open the blinds more freely as I have a room on the second floor, and it faces the back.
* you don't like sunlight shining into your eyes at 7:00 am. The room I have currently does not have that problem, as it does not face the direction of the sunrise.
* you don't like your roommates. You can get new ones if you move into my room.
* your roommates are too loud. The other people in my apartment keep to themselves mostly and I haven't really heard anything from them.
* your currant roommates are slobs. The people in my apartment are not.

The reason I want to move is because I am a very private person and sharing a bathroom with 5 other people is not ideal for me. 
If you are interested in switching but are worried that one bathroom is too small for 6 people please do not worry too much. During the past week, I have not seen anyone trying to use the bathroom while I was using it. If you are worried about someone using the bathroom when you also want to use the bathroom, there are two toilets/sinks/showers so there is enough room for everyone. 

If you wouldn't mind living in Stevens Court A, but think switching rooms is too much of a hassle I can pay the room switch fee for you, help you move, and pay you an extra $100 dollars for switching with me!

So if you are interested in switching, or know someone who is interested in switching, please PM me!

3tut0z,The difference between a 3.8 and a 4.0,"What do you guys think is the difference between a 3.8 and a 4.0? Is it just going the extra mile - always going to office hours, doing all the practice exam problems an extra time? Or do you think that people with 4.0's generally just understand the material better? Do you think there is a certain point with grades where getting a higher grade doesn't get you any tangible benefits? Is a 3.8 vs a 4.0 really a big deal?


I ask because I am applying to the math major for spring quarter, and my grades for the Calc series are: 4.0, 3.8, 3.9. Now in Calc 2 and 3 I felt that I really understood the material, but I had other engagements outside of class (work) and was taking Physics in addition to Calc. In the case of Calc 2 I actually underwent surgery during the quarter which caused me to get a lower grade on one of my midterms. I still feel that I could have done a lot better in those classes. The prerequisite GPA that they ask for on the app is your grades in the calc 12x series, correct?

Does UW not care about this? I mean, I have no problem with them hanging out here and all, but sometimes it makes me a little uncomfortable.

So far, I have noted:


*Location: 3rd Floor Ode

Person: Old white lady all in black.

Description: All she does is hang around on a computer on the quiet floor and watches videos all day. If she has to leave to get food or whatever, she will leave all her garbage/mess there for people not to take her spot. She sometimes answers the phone and answers it then after like 30 seconds finally goes to the bathroom to talk more comfortably.

Note: Ode staff never checks if she has a Husky Card after 7pm. Weird.


*Location: Suzzallo/Allen Basement

Person: Black dude with an oxygen tank.

Description: This guy just posts himself at the same desk here everyday and looks homeless. When the library closes, I see him just walking around campus at night. Not sure what he does until it closes.


*Location: Ode 1st & 3rd Floors

Person: Old Asian guy with a beanie

Description: This dude just hangs around Ode and just pulls his beanie over his head and just sleeps it off. Can be found on single chairs in first floor or 3rd floor.


*Location: HUB area on first floor where people take naps

Person: Old white lady

Description: This lady is just flat out crazy. If you sit by her, you'll just see her lying down on a couch, possibly sleeping. When she's not slumbering, you'll hear her talking to herself in an aggravated tone, which makes me a little uneasy for my safety at times.


*Location: Savery Hall

Person: Older white guy dress all in black.

Description: This guy hangs around in Savery during the night. He's dressed all in black with a black beanie covering most of his head that makes him look a little sketchy. I've seen him walking around campus sometimes, definitely not a student here. You can find him sleeping in Savery rooms throughout various times of the day since Savery apparently never locks their doors at night.


*Location:Ode

Person: Old white guy with a weird dress attire + bucket hat and glasses.

Description: This guy just lingers around Ode all day. I've made eye contact with him so many times and it feels like he just stares at me. Just plain creepy.

But it seems that the visa officer did not read it in full detail at all(maybe because it was kind of long) and did not acknowledge my situation. It is likely that they only thought about the fact that I am older than other ordinary students and just rejected me, assuming that I have ***immigration intent*** because I am attending college at my current age. They may have concerns that I would overstay/work illegally once I got the visa.

But it is not the truth, bullying is nothing that should be considered my fault and I suffered a lot from the situation. I have seen quite a lot of people with similar situations never be able to rise up from the abyss where they were struggling. But God knows how I managed to overcome those exceedingly insurmountable obstacles and managed to come back from that. I think it is the innate determination that has pushed me finally to this stage of life. It is funny that the bullies and everyone else from my previous school here in China never made it to UW or other similarly prestigious universities. 

After I was forced out of school because of these incidents, I almost never ceased learning everything I had at hand. I have been so desperately working hard to absorb every bit of knowledge that I have in my sight. I have come back from that abyss where a significant number of people were crashed, hammered, and scattered in pieces and I do not want this to affect my hard-earned opportunities anymore. I want to go to UW without being accused of having immigration intent and being older than other students. I hope everything I worked up will eventually pay off for me and I know I am well worth it. I promise I will work hard amongst the top determined students you have ever seen in your career and I hope I can have a chance to make you and UW proud! I have come back from a student who did not know how to cope when forced out of a Chinese middle school to someone that finds his way to finish four years of U.S. high school in one year and successfully send himself to college. I want to keep being a miracle worker! I love UW and desperately want to come!

Sincerely, may I please have some assistance regarding my visa application from UW? Today, I was rejected by an officer in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, likely due to my previous visa rejections when going to a community college(I wanted to transfer to a 4-year university from a CC first) and the fact I am older than other undergraduate college students, which means I am 26 years old now. Could you please offer me some guidance and assistance regarding my unique situation? I really want to nail this visa application and successfully come to UW.

I still have quite a bit more friends, I have a handful of extra curriculars, a job, I'm in some clubs, I feel like I am doing everything I am ""suppose to do."" But, the social scene that's now in my classes is hard to deal with and I have had people I never knew tell me they heard about what happened.

I have this fear that there are people in my classes that truly wish the worst for me, but I don't even know who they are. School has become such  stress inducing situation I feel like I have to navigate. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to deal with it and I feel like I genuinely would be uncapable of taking a class with one of the people I had a falling out with. Part of me wants to not come back to school or at least take a really long break and maybe come back looking like a completely different person and pretend I am someone else.

1apfply,"Why UDub? (And why not UC Berkeley, Brown, or Cornell?)","I'm a prospective grad student for all of the above schools (applied to molecular & cellular biology or genetics PhD programs). I'm having a tough choice deciding where to go. The community at UW MCB seemed wonderful when I visited, but I've also gotten good vibes from the other programs so far (except for Cornell, which I haven't interviewed with yet). Obviously there's no guarantee I'll actually get offers from all of these places, but right now they're top of my list and I want to hear others' perspectives on where they would go, if they were in my shoes. Would especially love to hear from you if you were also a prospective grad student at some of these other schools but instead decided to go to UW!

Background on me, if it helps:

\- I've grown up in small (Midwestern) towns and don't mind them. But I also feel like I could adapt to a smaller city like Seattle relatively easily

\- I LOVE seafood, hiking/camping, water activities, and skiing. I know it'd be harder to fulfill all of these requirements in Providence or Ithaca compared to Berkeley or Seattle...

\- I plan to go into academia, and would very much like to become tenure track. Unfortunately, I have heard that prestige and legacy really do open doors in academia. Genuinely asking (because I'm truly ignorant about these things), how recognizable is the UDub name? How prestigious is UDub's MCB graduate program? Would I have to do my PhD in Fred Hutch to turn heads, or would other partner institutes and UW campus labs also garner major respect? 

\- At this point, I have fairly equal labs/PIs of interest at all 4 institutions, so availability of research interests are not a limiting factor in my decision",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1apfply/why_udub_and_why_not_uc_berkeley_brown_or_cornell/,12,0

hxrbt9,I’m surprised,"I know US is kind of a hellhole right now, but can I just say how pleasantly surprised I am by the number of people who are wearing masks, at least around the campus area and the area near Canada-US border.
I’m currently back home in a suburban town in Canada and most people don’t wear masks here and no one says anything to them. Heck even the US border guards when I was going back to Seattle were wearing masks, but when I came back to Canada, the border guards there weren’t wearing them and they were sitting less than 2m from each other just chatting.

I think seeing so many “Karens” on social media refusing to wear mask and flaunting their white privilege can be frustrating and discouraging, and as much as Canadians like to feel we’re superior to the Americans, I think the majority of people in the US, or at least in Washington state are taking this seriously.

q4uebp,Let's have a serious discussion - What will be the necessary conditions for COVID to no longer impact our daily lives?,"Many parts of the country have already begun a transition back to normal, but I have observed the state of Washington, and apparently the students at UW, are very resistant to this transition. There has been this delta scare that has gone on now for a while, which has appeared to keep us in a perpetual loop of restrictions. 

What I want to address today, is what exactly the road to 'normalcy' will look like. There seems to be no mention of when the mask mandate will be lifted, or what the actual plan is for resolving our current state of affairs. Regarding vaccines, a strong majority of people are **already fully vaccinated**. The only people that aren't are:

* Those that are immunocompromised - this portion of the population is not going anywhere, there will always be people with weakened immune system and they will always be unfortunately over-susceptible to a **wide array of illnesses**, not just COVID.

* Those that are resisting getting vaccinated for their own moral or religious reasons - at the end of the day, there isn't much you can do about people who are delusional without going against their civil liberties and forcing them to do something against their will (which we need to ask ourselves, can we really resort to that?)

So as we have logically established, these two groups are not going anywhere, and by the way, neither are viral variants. Viruses adapt the same way any organic system would, and there will **always be** new mutations to deal with. 

-------------------

Also, before you tell me to ""suck it up and wear a mask"", I would like to point out that current restrictions extend way beyond just mask wearing:

* Many events (at least in my experience) that would normally be held in-person have still been virtualized, taking the human element and ability to meet other people out of them, despite the fact that a return to classes has been allowed. 

* Eating food in any area that is not an 'established common area' like the hub is disallowed (this doesn't even make any sense to me, if we have allowed people to eat maskless at the hub, why not in other indoor areas?)

* Currently you are not allowed to even drink coffee during classes (only water) due to having to pull down your mask to do so.

* Everyone must continue to wear masks even when inside gyms or fitness centers, and if you are engaging in a particularly aerobic task such as treadmill running, the issues with wearing a mask while doing so can range from miserable to straight up dangerous (asphyxiation). 

* I am not even sure why, but it seems like a lot of the students here feel compelled to wear their masks even when walking outside - I personally don't and I constantly feel like I am being stared at as if I am some sort of anti-vaxxer...

------------------

So now, to conclude, if all of these things have now reached a point of 'static equilibrium' and we still have all of these restrictions placed on us, I question how exactly we can ever contemplate the idea of returning back to some notion of normal. Now I ask all of you, what do you envision the roadmap might look like, or do you believe we should permanently live our lives as we are now?

12lkdhm,Incoming Husky worried about getting RESCINDED,"I was recently admitted to the UW for the CS major and the honors program as an out of state student. My stats were fairly good before senior year (4.0, 1550 SAT + ECs). However, I really tanked hard starting this fall (especially after submitting college apps). I earned at least 3 Bs in my 1st semester and astonishingly received a D in AP CS A (I had no prior CS experience by the way). I stopped attending school consistently due to a string of numerous illnesses (flu, covid, staph infection) starting in November 2022 and that has led to me ""snowballing"" my lack of preparation for tests and school in general. 

In short, I am very worried about my 2nd semester grades (potentially dropping below 3.0) and whether or not I would be rescinded for this precipitous drop in academics, and I am unsure if my explanation to the admissions office about my illnesses would suffice.

r7ma9z,Husky Card Rant (keep scrolling),"Disclaimer:  I'm not looking for solution, as this is not a *real* problem.  I have just found the scenario humorous enough to write about while drinking a beer.  If you're a hater, kindly downvote and leave your negative comments to yourself.  I'm fortunate enough for the following situation to be the biggest issue I've got right now, following traffic & MGH wifi, and I do not take this seriously.

I'm a weird person and I don't like cords or plugging things in.  I love the fact that I can place my phone down and it starts charging instead of having to plug it in.  I made a decision on the air buds I use because the case can be charged wirelessly.  These simple pleasures I treasure.

I keep my husky card in my phone protector.  When I need to get on the light rail, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  When I need to get into UW buildings after hours, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  I love how seamless this is.  But then there is the IMA.  Because of COVID and a lack of lockers, I have to keep my stuff at my locker in the HUB, where I change and then jog to the IMA.  I don't like heavy things in my pockets when I'm running, so I don't bring my wallet, I don't bring my keys.  I bring my phone and that's it.

But at the IMA we have to *swipe* our ID card, to obtain access.  That's no biggie, I changed my phone protector to be one that has the cover that opens up like a book, which has a place to put ids, etc.  So, I get in, I take out my card, swipe, and then happily go to sweat and suffer.

A couple weeks ago the magnetic swipe stopped working.  The very kind and patient staff at the IMA happily took my card and manually looked me up to make sure I wasn't some degenerate WSU student or something, and then let me pass.  After this happened multiple days in a row, one of them suggested that I get a new card; I could tell their patience was wearing thin.  I thought, why should I get a new card?  It still works everywhere else?    When I need to get on the light rail, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  When I need to get into UW buildings after hours, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.

I found out that the reason is that magnetic swipes are prone to corruption when they are placed in electromagnetic fields like the ones created on wireless chargers.  I got a new card.  This time, I decided to just leave it in my wallet.  That worked fine.  Lightrail - still worked.  After-hour access - still worked.  I just hold my wallet next to readers instead of my phone.  But then - of course - I forgot one day to remember to take my card out of my wallet to bring with me to the IMA when I tried to take it out of my phone.  Next week, I did it again.

I've now purchased a new phone case to allow access to the card, and two new husky cards.  But there is an obvious solution, here.

Our    project needs short-term volunteers (no skills or money required) to    help build a database to train a machine learning algorithm that will    contribute to our overall project of tracking Russian military  movements   in Ukraine. We need individuals to help us with the  following tasks:

1. Identify images of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers and military equipment.
2. Collect images featured in Russian propaganda. 

The    individuals volunteering to sort images of soldiers and military    equipment will be provided an easy crash course by the verification team    lead (me). Here is an example of the material that will be covered in    the crash course: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo).    Volunteers will be provided images and clearly marked folders in  which   to sort them. Military knowledge helpful but not necessary.  
The    atrocities committed by Russian forces every day are testament to the    need for efficient and reliable real-time tracking of Russian troop    movements for the safety of Ukrainian civilians. Please help by  donating   some of your time. Even as little as a couple hours would be  helpful.   It’s possible to volunteer remotely any day of the week, but  we usually   meet at 10pm over Zoom. **I  am  also a college student in Boston, and our team consists of college   students and subject field experts in the US and Europe.

lk6grz,The truth is? Nobody cares anymore.,"Not just Greek Row. As a ""primary source"", someone living in the dorms, I can tell you that the people living in the dorms and hanging out around campus don't care either. No social distancing at all, a bunch of friends playing in the snow together or inviting each other over into dorms for little kickbacks, etc.

Greek Row gets scapegoated once again while not a **single** soul on the Ave, Campus, U-District, etc. follows guidelines. Is Greek Row wrong? Yes. But if you want a petition to suspend them, you better suspend the dorm students as well. In other words, suspend everyone who came out to live on/near campus this year.

It's extremely naive to think they are the only ones in the entire city of Seattle ""ruining it for us"" hahaha, HFS ain't even truly regulating shit to be completely honest. I remember when we had a fire drill and we all huddled up together on the field. Some employee said ""hey, social distancing"" and nobody listened and remained huddled up. Like, hundreds of people.

It is what it is. You guys who are completely remote (most of the people on this reddit) just have no idea what's really going on. The problem is everyone, me included. Shit really got worse in regards to social distancing after the constant stream of great vaccine news, I'll tell you that much.

Go ahead and downvote this post, but I'm just telling it like it is: they aren't the only ones and honestly haven't been since like September. The entire United States fucked this one up, and so we just wait until we're vaccinated by summer and carry on with our lives. If Fall is online again, it wasn't because of Greek Row. It was due to poor vaccine distribution. But, Biden is making good progress and daily vaccinations passed the million mark, so there's that. Cheers.

Edit: If you wanted to complain about Greek Row in the summer, that makes sense. Vaccine was far off and the situation was ""in control"" up until that point around early July. But now? Give me break. We're averaging 1000+ cases a day (7-day average) without their help. This shit is all fucked.


Edit 2: No I’m not gonna go around taking pictures of the dorm people or people around campus and report back to this subreddit. I’m not fucking weird. Remember that deleted post from the summer where one of you weirdos took a picture of some Greek people chilling on their front lawn with their live-in mates and complained despite the fact that that was their family unit?

1bnsll2,I wish I could tell all the tourists that the cherry blossoms are NOT worth it ,"My family literally dragged me to go take pictures with them when we were stuck in hours of traffic because the ramp to the 520 was closed, so we had to go all the way around the U district to get on the I-5 to go home. I honestly wonder like, do these people really think it was a good idea to sit in jam packed traffic just to come take some dumb pictures in a giant crowd? Seriously? There is no way in hell it is enjoyable at that point and they shouldn’t have come. 

 I’ve always had a slight distaste for tourists because I feel like they get in the way of people who are actually affiliated with the school in some way but most of the time I remain indifferent since they seem docile. But when it comes to cherry blossom season it becomes super annoying and I had to get ready for spring quarter the next day. Hope those stupid pictures were worth it.

3svoj7,How can the Black Lives Matter movement gain YOUR support on campus?,"As this is a college subreddit, I was wondering why you do or don't support Black Lives Matter.

One of the main issues I see with this movement is that it has horrible leadership. Perhaps it is an issue with media coverage but it always seems that some idiot gets everyone fired up in the wrong way (i.e. getting up in Bernie Sanders face, blocking highways, or most recently blocking 45th).

Also, they seem to pick the wrong people to use as symbolism for their movement. Mike Brown was the go-to representative death to use for the BLM protests, but he was a violent thief that charged a cop. Why not choose Eric Garner or Ervin Edwards?

Also this mob thinking that all white people are the same and that colored people cannot be prejudiced. Some of the most hateful, racist comments I have ever heard uttered have been from black people (but most recently the internationals who come here who rant about EACH OTHER! Chinese vs japanese, koreans vs japanese etc). That's just my anecdotal evidence, not saying all are like that, but that's what I have been exposed to.

This video in particular, during which they silence a young asian woman speaking out against group-think and taking a very MLK like stance really grinds my gears: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8UTj8lQJhY

We have to face the facts: black people are disproportionately targetted by police, were the original targets of drug war campaigns, are underepresented due to their low economic class, underepresented further by the high rate of felony incarceration which leaves them unable to vote for life, and of course daily misjudgement and treatment by other races who fear/loathe them because of persistant blind bigotry, and the gangs and high crime rates the black race is associated with here in America.

However, as one commenter said below, the BLM crowd tends to focus on these outside forces and never on internals. The black populace needs to be equipped with the institutional tools and financial support to rid their communities of black on black violence, reinforce the role of fathers, drive the gangs and violent criminals out, and educate their children so that they don't fall into the poverty trap that is the current state of black society.

These are blatant faults that are not the MAJORITY of the reason their society remains beaten down after so many years of ""equal opportunity"" laws, but should be acknowledged by the BLM crowd as further evidence that the black community needs attention. Replacing the constant ""check your privilege"" jabs and anti-white brigades with this acknowledgement won't piss off the people who are in position to help you and will gain the support of other minorities who face many of the same issues.

There is no doubt resubmissions have a significant impact on your grade. This was one of the only ways I was able to learn in 142; in these times of pandemic there already isn't much teacher-to-student contact and communication. I used feedback from my TA's as a place to get personal help and explanations on what I was doing right or wrong and then have the opportunity to resubmit with my new knowledge. Now we are in a new offering of 143 that has even less teacher to student contact, due to the lectures being videos from other quarters, and there still is no resubmissions

So now my grade might suffer drastically due to a ""staffing issue"".

Not saying the CS department is to blame for this. Sounds like there truly is a shortage of TAs this quarter. Not sure what the solution is, but what's frustrating is there are staffing issues plaguing UW in all areas yet we are still getting charged the full price to go here.  \~60k for me to not receive what is promised from this education. For example, we are forced to have a dining plan if on campus but the dining options are super inaccessible due to ""staffing issues"". Well if you didn't require it then there would be less strain on the dining system and in turn higher accessibility. Of course, this won't happen because UW has proven time and time again it loves money.

I understand they don't have enough TA's for resubmissions, I just think they should do something grading-wise to account for this change, something that would still give me a chance in competing with students who took 143 in a quarter that had resubmissions.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/s1r1lj/still_mad_about_cse_143e_still_having_no/,15,0

mn1qr4,What can you do with a humanities degree? Part 2,"What can you do with a humanities degree? We've asked graduates from across the Humanities Division to write about what their current jobs are like, and how their educations helped prepare them for the challenges and responsibilities of their current work.

Right now, we're spotlighting Maureen Trantham, who discusses how her humanities education has helped her to become Senior Vice President of Operations, Social Impact and Philanthropy at Sesame Workshop (yes, the people who make Sesame Street)!

Maureen majored in Comparative History of Ideas (CHID) and Journalism. She writes, “At the UW, my CHID and Journalism professors not only encouraged me to engage in my own independent research and inquiry through the Mary Gates Undergraduate Research Scholarship, but also apply my learnings and develop practical skills via internships like the Journalism Foreign Intrigue Program. This blend of theory and practice taught me to be flexible, creative, pragmatic and solution-oriented. It also strengthened my ability to pull from multiple disciplines to deconstruct a problem – whether I am advising executives, analyzing the merits of different strategies or developing implementation plans. This laid the foundation for my work in journalism, education policy and advocacy, management consulting and now operations at Sesame.”

• You shed DAYS BEFORE you develop symptoms and you’re at your most infectious during this time

• Masks work to prevent spread to those around you and they don’t work if you have your nose out.

 My question to the people who roam this subreddit, should I tell the professor that this person is working in a group on this specific test? 

Some details:
1. Class is not curved
2. Not a lot of people taking this test so it's easy to distinguish who is cheating
3. I don't even know his name or his major, so this isn't personal
4. I know a friend who is friends with this person, so it's possible to figure how his identity
5. He will be taking 3 different tests, which I am fairly certain that he will be working in a group for all of them. Therefore, giving him an advantage
6. I have studied for this test, so it's not a sense of jealously (I think)

But something was wrong, he was foaming at the mouth while sickly scampering towards me on all fours. Before I could do anything he was on top of me, he preceded to stick his tail in my mouth and punch me in the balls while whispering things like “wuhan” and “human filth” under his breath. And as quickly as it happened, as if he caught the scent of some other prey he scampered off in the direction of Red Square. I am ok, but I just want to warn others to keep an eye out and stay safe.

26tln0,Why is the UW screwing over students so hard in tuition?," Why is the tuition a whopping $12.5k a year when the UW is sitting on an endowment bank of 2.3 billion dollars up 235 million on last year? If they took the 235 million dollar increase from last year and put it towards lowering the tuition of the 29 thousand undergraduate students they would  have lowered it by over $8k meaning it would instead cost us only $4.5k. They would still have their 2.1 billion dollar bank that they had last year.

And to make matters worse despite the overpriced tuition and large endowment the university still won't get its act together regarding the abysmal acceptance rates of its engineering schools and other programs. Computer science and engineering has dropped below a 28% acceptance rate and other programs are having similar funding issues.

What the fuck is going on and why the fuck are we getting screwed over so hard? What happened to this being a public university? I don't know how they expect students like me to be able to afford $27k a year costs. The only reason I'm able to keep attending is because summer software internships pay well and I work 40 hours each week while going part-time(which doesn't save much on tuition...). Which is pretty pathetic for a public university. By no means is the problem only relevant to the UW. It's an issue across the entire American public university system at the moment.

5pg06u,Response to UW Presidential Statement Regarding Shooting,"If you're a UW student, you should've gotten President Ana Mari's email about our non-acceptance to violence.

A few months ago, a Muslim girl was attacked on campus. We asked that an email be sent out at the time, so that the UW community would not make light of crimes against Muslims or put anyone's safety in jeopardy.The perpetrator was on the loose, we wanted to know who he was.

CAIR set up a press conference on Red Square, and yet the UW did not release any statement on the assault. CAIR even put up a reward for any information on the attacker.. and still a silence from the university.

I am asking you to respond to Ana Mari's email informing her about your concern for violence using the template below and how silence about it may mean it will reoccur. A strict stance against it means speaking about it every time it happens and finding every subscriber to it.

Fill in the spaces regarding your affiliation the UW, and your name at the end. Copy/paste into a reply email to the President's earlier statement (and share with your friends).

Dear President Ana Mari,

I am writing to you today not only out of gratitude for your acknowledgment of the incidents which transpired last night, as well as your reaffirment of our University’s intent to serve as a violence-free zone, but also out of disappointment over the lack of similar concern over a violent act which occurred on-campus the afternoon of November 15th, 2016.

The messages you espoused regarding the election results on November 9th were hopeful and inspiring. As a ___________ (student, faculty member, worker, researcher, alumni, etc.) of the University of Washington, I was proud to uphold “...our responsibility to serve the public good...” which would “never waver” and to be working “...to reaffirm our ongoing and unwavering support toward creating and nurturing an inclusive, diverse and welcoming community.”

However, that right and gratitude was tarnished shortly after the receival of such uplifting messages, when I heard no word from my University’s President concerning the violent physical assault of a female Muslim student on-campus. This silence spoke volumes. Instead of apologizing on behalf of the University for the struggles she faced on its grounds, and educating the rest of the community body on the crime’s specifics to promote help in finding the perpetrator, and providing information for everybody’s safety, I can only assume an e-mail sent on November 17th was intended to encompass this incident along with others by stating, “[t]here have...been several reports of harassment, vandalism and violent incidents, in our state and even on our own campuses. We want to be clear: assault, discrimination, harassment, or vandalism have no place on our campuses.”

Although such statements were necessary to make, they were not sufficient. The nature of this crime was such that the outrage for this crime, seeking justice for this crime, and intolerance for any such crime - then, now, and in the future - should stand alone, and not be inferred as being a part of a broader statement. This was an assault, this was discrimination, and this must be prevented in the future in keeping with the vision for this University that you have shared of a nurturing, inclusive, and welcoming community.

My concern is the safety of everyone on campus, as is yours. I hope to see action from the University of Washington administration that reflects a consciousness for every student regardless of their background, way of life, or faith. The concern should be vocal, prominent, and transparent.

I thank you in advance for your willingness to speak up on behalf of all of us, especially the purposely marginalized.

Sincerely,

cxr7mj,CS Direct Admit first quarter schedule/other general advice,"Hey guys,

I'm an incoming freshman DA and I am worried about the schedule I am registered for currently; I tried reaching out to a cs advisor but they haven't gotten back to me yet. I'd really appreciate any advice you have for me.

The classes I'm registered for now are CSE 311, 351, and 391, with a 7 credit Landscape Architecture FIG. The total credit amount is 16, but it will be 18 after adding the DA Seminar class. I'm concerned that this schedule would be very time-consuming. I know a lot of students take two CSE classes a quarter but 17 credits are quite intimidating. I was hoping to take a lighter course load for this fall quarter in order to get used to UW and the dorms, make new friends and have fun, focus on trying to get an internship, etc. What do you guys think? 

I am leaning towards dropping 351 and 391 and adding an easier general education class, but I wanted to know if I'd be alright for the future and not too overwhelmed with CSE classes. For reference, I am bringing in 105 total credits from running start/AP and would like to graduate in three years. I need 23 more credits of general education, need to take Phys 122 and Math 308, and then the rest are CSE classes. I want to balance how many CSE courses I take so that I don't take too many or too little in the 3rd year. I want to fill out the rest of my classes with electives in business, statistics, economics, communications, etc. to help me in the industry. I am unsure of double majoring/minoring. 

Finally, I want to get a new laptop for school and was interested in the difference between MacBooks and Windows laptops for CSE. Would MacBooks be easier? I heard they might because they are Unix machines but I have no knowledge about that. Do most students prefer one over another? I would love to buy a MacBook pro but they are very expensive, even with the student discount right now. Would a premium laptop be helpful with the nice computer labs in the CS buildings?

Do you guys have any other general advice for new computer science students?

Thanks

And looking beyond the rankings, I see so many other tangible advantages that aren’t taken into account in the rankings - like UDub’s proximity to all the amazing companies in Seattle - Amazon, Meta, Google, the endowments from Pauly boy and BillyG, the guest lectures by Distinguished Scientists from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others, the wealth of nearby companies to intern at who don’t have to pay for your accommodation in this tight market, the startup scene, and the constantly rising bar of incoming CS Freshman, mostly gene-gifted kids of the sea of software engineer parents in the Puget Sound and beyond. I think UDub CS has an amazing future.

Yet I see this intense fascination with the lesser ranked Ivies and non-Ivies. Are these folks mere brand name chasers who want bragging rights, and/or have been conditioned to think that way by their helicopter parents, or am I missing something else.

Or has this school been basically been stereotyped as one?,"The only time I can remember is that famous video/meme when there were anti-racism protestors yelling in the library and when a foreign Korean student said “this is library” (basically asking them to quiet down) then the protestors immediately told him to “go back to Beijing”. 

I believe everyone has a right to protest when it comes to racial inequality but you’re literally gonna go to a library where the rules are to be quiet so people can study and then get mad and  immediately blurt racial slurs just because someone politely asked you to be quiet? Hypocrisy much? Like do you even care about your movement if you’re just making yourselves look worse?

Anyways,

I also do remember the Republican club being banned or something but I don’t really care ab that anyways. Let’s be real who in their right mind would join a Republican club at uw? Or join one in general?

On the other hand, I do see a lot of those annoying pro-life/anti-lgbtqia people with the speakers on telling everyone they’ll go to hell and stuff like that.

People warned me that this school is a “leftist hell hole” with a bunch of teenagers following “woke” trends but really “don’t know what they’re talking about and just repeat what they hear on Twitter” and etc.

But so far, I haven’t seen any of that. I haven’t seen an evergreen college situation. Is it just me? Has anyone else had a politically annoying person bother them in some way? If not, where tf is this reputation coming from? I get we’re in WA but they’re acting like the dining hall only has vegan food or something.

ao2q4u,We don't have all the information about the recent tragedy! Stop witch hunting!,"I think it's important to remember that in the face of tragedy it's easy to leap to conclusions. While the recent death on campus is a truly horrible event, we simply don't know enough to make a judgement on the role of the administration in the recent death.

&#x200B;

All the evidence we have that the administration could have prevented the tragedy is a haphazard collection of anecdotes. Sure, people are posting here that they slipped and fell and that they saw substandard work being done to de-ice walkways, but is that really enough to make an empirical judgement on the safety of campus? A bunch of random redditors and students can't judge the administration's effectiveness in dealing with the ice, instead we need an official investigation by qualified authorities. 

&#x200B;

Next, I'm not convinced that we should be expecting the university to completely de-ice campus. Is it reasonable to buy enough salt and sand to cover all of the walkways on campus, and is there enough time and money to hire the workers needed to spread it? I don't know, and neither do you. We simply aren't aware of the logistics behind a thorough campus de-icing, and before leaping to the conclusion that the administration is mishandling the situation we should consider the possibility that completely de-icing the campus (as some people on this sub seem to want) is unfeasible.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I'm sure the administration is under considerable pressure to reopen campus as soon as possible. Every day campus is closed, the university is losing a considerable amount of money. Research isn't being done, floors aren't being cleaned, books aren't being shelved, students aren't being educated. Cauce simply can't shut down  campus without extremely good reason. A death is more than enough reason to close campus, but hindsight is 20/20. Cauce chose to open campus with the knowledge that something like this may happen, because there was obviously still ice on the ground. Us experiencing such a tragedy doesn't necessarily mean the Cauce made the wrong call. 

&#x200B;

Of course, the administration could be at fault. The thing is, we don't have enough information yet to say. Stop jumping to conclusions!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ao2q4u/we_dont_have_all_the_information_about_the_recent/,3,0

n7kdi7,I feel like the whole uni is being my enemy,"I think I'm doing alright in academics, but when I attend class, or even thinking of going to campus this upcoming fall, I feel like everyone would gang up on me and throw hate, and even try to make fun of me; stress from studying doesn't bother me, but thinking of meeting a fellow student from UW is now a biggest fear I have now because I keep building anxiety of thoughts that everyone fucking hates me. And now it just turned into a scale of whole uni; I'm scared of even being here but I have to stay to graduate. 

I'm just done with everything, I'm fucking done. I don't want to feel like shit for not being able to express my opinion and always criticized for what I say; yes most of things were very dumb and I just ranted about things and apparently people got really mad and confused about it making me feel dumb but that's fine. But I guess no matter how nice I approach or how much I try, at least nobody in this school going to take me seriously and be friend or even acquaintance. ""People are usually nice here."" Yes that might've been true to you, but not for me. Or some of you might say ""You probably have never really try to be friends with them."" Well I tried. I tried to talk to classmate and tried to be active on discussion, everything. And almost every single one of them treated my opinion and thoughts like a garbage. I feel like I'm extreme minority who never gets along. There was literally no room for me to really ""enjoy"" this place and opportunity I have without fearing the backfire and aftermath of me speaking up. 
But then you might say ""well if your opportunity is shit, that's what you get"". I think it's not civil when you try to put me down for having different opinion. 

I guess it started with imposter syndrome, but it turned into something bigger than I thought, and I just need a help. I'm gonna get downvotes but I just wanted to share a piece of thoughts. Some of you might say ""well that's not what everyone thinks and people I've seen so far are nice so you are wrong."" I don't care how nice everyone was to you, my encounter and experiences in this place was terrifying and lonely all the time. I don't want to have a debate over if my feeling is right or wrong. Just scroll down if me or this post bothers you because it's cringe. I know I am cringe for everyone but I think I'm still entitled to how I feel. I'm fucking terrified with this place.

40pna2,"Why is everyone on reddit udub a CS, Math, or engineering major?","My title is obviously an exaggeration but it's to highlight something I've noticed.

Why does it seem like an overwhelming amount of people who post here are either computer science, math, or engineering majors?

I know computer science and engineering are popular degrees at UW, but as far as I'm aware Math isn't a very popular major relatively speaking. I'm a math major and it's rare for me to find other math majors in general ed courses.

There are a ton of people at UW who major in biology and I also know psychology is a popular degree as well. Yet I rarely ever hear anybody on this reddit say they are either one of these degrees.

Also what about the liberal arts and the social sciences? I think I've only seen maybe 2 or so people say they are a liberal arts or social science major. I've seen a little more people say they are business majors, but again not very much despite the fact that business also is a pretty popular degree at UW.

Do you think it's possible that people who don't major in STEM don't post here or don't admit to being a non-STEM major even if they post here because of potential STEM degree arrogance on the part of STEM students?

If you think that explanation is wrong what do you think is a possible explanation for this? Or do any of you disagree with my observation to begin with?

After lots of research, I have found that if you want to be a UW CS major as a running start student it is most important that you get the CS major [prerequisites](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/currentuw) finished ([with nearly perfect grades](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/transfer)) so you can enroll for direct admission into the CS major as a freshman because as of 2019 the CS major became a [predominantly direct admission major](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm). You should only go for an associate's degree if you have enough leftover classes after finishing the prerequisites for the CS major with high grades. An associate's degree is good for your resume and working before you get your bachelor's. I don't think most people will work at more than minimum wage jobs until after completing their major anyways, making the associate's degree seem nearly pointless for UW CS majors. After completing the prerequisites it is important to get as many [CS Major Graduation Requirements](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/ugrad/curriculum/CS_reqs_wi22.pdf) as your community college offers as possible to finish the required courses at an easier and cheaper college.

And if you haven’t, would you use it when there might be someone of another gender in there with you? And would people support/feel comfortable if this kind of bathroom situation became more common across campus—like if buildings without existing single-use gender neutral bathrooms had **some** of their gendered ones degendered for inclusivity?

ne9ned,rant: mandatory attendance sucks,"I don't know about anyone else, but I'm getting sick of teachers requiring mandatory presence for Zoom lectures. It feels like such a joke.

My professor keeps tacking on more in-class grades to force students to grill their eyeballs on yet another synchronous virtual class, and my grade is suffering. She even calls on students at random to try and boost interaction.

I know this is all done in some seemingly-positive effort to try and force students to feel like school still matters or whatever, but doesn't even motivate me to go to class! If anything I'm flooded with anxiety and loath the class more and more. These tricks and gimmicks to force attendance just feel insensitive and deceptive. Attendance shouldn't be mandatory.

I just wish I could study and watch class on my own time and have my academic value be displayed through test scores or something. I just can't take this anymore. Zoom is miserable.",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ne9ned/rant_mandatory_attendance_sucks/,8,18

qpsjxa,Faux-Change,"Yesterday I posted a picture of garbage as the result of a party hosted by a Greek House. 

First an update, they have filled a few bags with trash but have decided that any trash that has strayed beyond what is directly in front of their house as not their problem. That trash is there because of your party, so pick it up! That is the mindset of those dawgs and it is why I said that trash is never picked up. 

I want to point out the absurdity in the outrage that followed my post. Why are you getting upset over something that is illegal and causing harm? Are you not outraged when somebody is unjustly killed or raped or do you pass the responsibility of a crime onto the victim? Maybe the issue isn't so clear because our environment does not have a voice, but protecting it is just as valid a reason as protecting another human from injustices. Drop the antiquated and misogynistic idea of ""we're just having fun"" or ""it's not a big deal."" These are the same arguments that people of privilege use to justify their disgusting actions against the lesser in society. If you are one of those people who are angry with police-brutality, racism, inequality, dismissal of victims, but are at the same time outraged because somebody is bringing to light your own bad actions, then you are just advocating faux-change and latching onto movements because everybody else is doing it.

1oggek,"""End Rape"" and Reporting Other Graffiti","I think students at UW would appreciate the fact I think it should be common knowledge that there has been a recent graffiti outbreak both on campus and in the U-District.

The graffiti I am referencing reads ""End Rape"", and first showed up a few weeks ago, with more appearing just this last weekend.

Obviously if you know anyone who might have been involved in writing graffiti or has actually written this or other graffiti, you should contact the Seattle Police Department at phone number (206) 625-5011.

I understand [from this page](https://www.seattle.gov/police/contact/reporting/default.htm) that if your tip leads to an arrest or charge, you can earn up to a $1,000 reward. (Disclosure: tip leading to an arrest on graffiti will probably only get you $10-$20. HOWEVER, since this same graffiti is sprouting up everywhere, I'd imagine they would hand over something closer to $100-$150, especially since some of it is on-campus.)

You can also report graffiti to SPD using [this online report form](http://www.seattle.gov/police/prevention/graffiti.htm). It takes about 5 minutes.

Let's keep the University clean!

aojiqg,I feel uneasy about this.,"So while the ice wasn't directly to blame for her death, it doesn't change the fact campus was still left with dangerous conditions. They could of done better deicing campus, as shown by the response of ice clean up directly after the death of that student. 

It doesn't change the fact that people still injured themselves on the ice the past few days. If you have limited mobility or a mobility based disability it was extremely challenging to navigate campus, unreasonably so. It doesn't change the fact that people didn't feel safe on campus. People are saying we're treating students like they're inept by advocating for less ice on campus. But not all of us are familiar with navigating ice. Not all of us can just get back up if we slip on the ice. Not all of us can pay for a trip to the doctor if we fall and get a concussion or break our nose (both of which happened to people due to the ice).

People jumped to conclusions but that doesn't change the fact that campus was still dangerous. UW didn't take proper precautions, didn't work on cleaning up the ice and then when something might of happened due to it, they finally cleaned everything up. They could of done better from the start and that's clear. 

I'm not calling for anyone's head on a plate, just I feel uneasy that the state of discussion about the ice has turned to ""it's just ice, stop being such a baby"" and people being downvoted for anything to the contrary. It's clear we tend to have a bad mob mentality, even now with our response with concern to the ice after we realized someone didn't die as a direct result of it. 

So I don't know, I'm just uneasy about the ice and how everything was handled by both UW and now by us, its students.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/aojiqg/i_feel_uneasy_about_this/,9,28

In addition to being stabbed twice I also got several doses of water flung in my face from near misses with umbrella carriers. It must be great to be short and just hide under your little canopy of umbrellas but god damn it's just so selfish.

rgbpxv,Serious question for vegans,"Are there any plants that you refuse to eat for ethical reasons?  Here, I am asking specifically about avoiding a particular plant rather than avoiding a plant because it was farmed or harvested in an unsustainable way.

The reason I ask is that, while I do eat meat, there are a number of animals that I choose to not eat for ethical reasons.  For example, pigs are quite intelligent and, for this reason, I do not eat them.   I do not have a hard a fast rule for which animals I will and will not eat.  But, the larger, older or more intelligent an animal, the less likely I am to eat it.

I understand that most of the plant food we eat does not live that long.  But, let's suppose, for example, that humans could eat oak trees.  I would definitely avoid eating oak trees because of their immense size and age.  Same goes for those beautiful cherry trees we have on campus.

So, to reiterate my question for the vegans in the room (or anybody I guess): are plants that you avoid eating, specifically because you think it is wrong to do so rather than because the plant was farmed in a unsustainable or environmentally unfriendly way?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/rgbpxv/serious_question_for_vegans/,14,2

I'm a rising junior in high school. Connecticut resident. I know going to an OOS public school isn't... smart... but I know that the University of Washington is a great school and I've always wanted to visit/live in Seattle (never been, though; I should probably do that). 

UConn's also a great school, but I don't know about the campus life. I'm not into partying or anything, but the only thing to do over there is to visit the cows they have on a farm and sporting events that I have little interest in (I'm down for hockey, though. How's that at UW?). Apparently administration is pretty uncooperative as well at UConn. 

I'm pretty sure that UConn and UW (if that's the correct abbreviation) are pretty much equal in academics. **I'm more concerned with post-graduation: co-op/research/etc. opportunities, job market, career guidance/resources, etc.**

**Prospective majors/programs — in order of interest:** 

- Chemistry 

- Pre-pharmacy (will likely major in chem during this time, and I'd hope to get both degrees)

- Engineering (big oof; Chemical Engineering or Material Science and Engineering) 

- Pre-dentistry (would also major in chem and hope to get degree in both)

- Undeclared if I can't figure it out by then. 

Also, how similar to NYC is Seattle? I'm not too fond of the former, but Seattle seems like it's own thing. 

Back to hockey: what team do you guys like over there? You don't have a team, so I guess I'm free to continue rooting for the Rangers. Big criterion in my college search.

ltttpi,Questions on drinking/partying/social life/housing from an exchange student from the UK,"Obvious COVID disclaimer, any questions related to partying assume it'll be safe to do so next year.

I will (most likely) be studying as a junior at UW next year as an exchange student from the UK, and my only knowledge of drinking/partying/social life at US colleges comes from TV and movies so I've got like a dozen questions. Male, will be 20 for most of the school year.

Given the drinking age of 18, ""partying"" at uni in the UK involves just buying alcohol and drinking in halls, or going to university bars, or going to clubs/bars in the city (I live in London) like any adult. Pretty standard at my uni at least would be clubbing or going to student bar 2-4 times a week. How does UW compare?

The consensus from previous posts seems to be that if you're not ""in the Greek system"", as a guy you're not going to get into any frat parties. Is this still/actually the case? Also, what does ""in"" mean? Do you have to actually be in a frat, or if you are friends with fraternity member(s) will you be able to reliably get onto guestlists? Or is having friends get you on guestlists more of a sometimes works/sometimes doesn't thing?

If to reliably (like every week or fortnight) get into frat parties you actually have to be in a frat, is this an option for an exchange student? 

What are the non-frat options like? Do people under 21 generally have fake IDs and go to clubs/bars in the city? How common are non-frat house parties, and how is it to get into them? Is it just a case of knowing people?

Do most juniors/seniors live off-campus? I don't really want to have to try to organise private accom abroad, so assume I'll apply for halls/apartments, so would I live predominantly with people younger than me?

Are any halls more/less social than others? (the reputation seems to change year by year from previous posts). What are apartments like, as in do they have staff, or can you just drink as if it were private accom?

Hi everyone! I'm currently choosing the college I will attend this fall, and my top 2 choices rn are University of Washington (Direct CS) + Interdisciplinary Honors ($30k since I'm a resident), and UC Berkeley L&S ($48k).

Housing is really expensive, and the system is poorly organized. The undergrad classes aren't as exceptional as the high academic rating, which only comes from the amazing graduate schools, would make it seem. Class selection is average (in comparison to other colleges). 

Registration is horrible. But like many other things, this is mainly because of the awful technology department. 

The enormous population decreases the quality of everything. Housing becomes highly limited, registration is crowded and competitive, there are fewer open job opportunities, less professor-student interaction due to large classes,  etc. 
You just become another part of the huge, faceless crowd. Making friends or distinguishing yourself in any way is difficult because the sheer number of people, unless you deliberately go out of your way to do so.

People immediately started firing at me and some say I’m a 12 year old and some say I embarrassed the rest of you. I seriously lost hope in this city. I am an outsider and I will leave in just one year. I absolutely have no duty in making this place safer. However, I think it is in everyone’s favor that tragical incidents will not happen in the future. I posted this, at least as a reminder to raise awareness. What do I get? Criticism and hatred. Is it all because I said China is safer? There are a lot of country that are safer than the US and you are just going to sit there and be grumpy about it? I thought I did a good thing posting this in remembrance of the horrible incident that happened on the Ave yesterday. Apparently I’m wrong. You rather things stay this way than having an outsider pointing out the problem should be dealt with. 

           ————————Original Post———————

Almost everyday there is violent crime happening somewhere near the Ave. I just saw the email saying a girl was assaulted, pushed to the ground and slashed with a razor blade. Yesterday some one displayed a pistol; and just days ago some one even had an ax.

Why are we still so chill about it. The Ave has become the home for homeless people and every time I walk near them I feel deeply disturbed because they are all crazy and yell on the street all day. Incidents like those happen almost everyday and never was a suspect ever found by the police. There are no cameras, no nothing. And UW never did anything other than sending emails. As an university, UW has the responsibility to make its campus a safe place for everyone; but now, our very life is threatened everyday and there is nothing they are doing to prevent it. If it was other places, students would go on a strike a long time ago. We have to do something. Crimes like this is happening more and more often and we cannot just sit back and watch them happen. Next time, the victim might be us.

Edit: Why no one is focusing on the real underlying problem I’m trying to say here? I am not saying homeless people are the cause of all those problems. I don’t believe it was homeless people who robbed key bank yesterday, and I am not saying we should just make them leave. I am truly sorry for them and I often help them whenever I can. However, there are a lot of crazy people around the campus and you cannot deny that by saying the Ave is not part of the campus, that’s just ridiculous and lying to yourself. What I’m trying to say is we should urge the university and the police department to have better protection.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/evqade/why_are_we_still_so_chill_about_the_ave/,65,60

(Hear me Out...),"So I am currently in the IBDP, and the way things are going, it's looking like UW is going to give me 45 credits at the start of my freshman year for doing so. From what I have seen, this is approximately a year's worth considering the minimum to graduate is 180 creds.

I am also a DA for UW CS, so that's my planned major.

I don't want to graduate early. So I have been thinking about possible alternatives. One of which is double-majoring. Now under normal circumstances I would understand being bombarded with ""dude, don't do it, you're going to die"" comments, but it doesn't seem that double-majoring within four years with 45 starting credits seems that ridiculous. But of course, I accept that I am probably totally naïve. 

I know that CS is going to be hard, but I think that doing another supplementary major like Statistics or Physics or something that would make me even more attractive for hiring could be a good idea.

ininyt,Wear a mask when you hike please,"Please wear face coverings when you hike please, especially when you hike in groups, or pass people on narrow trails. 

Yesterday I went hiking. I saw several groups of size 10-20, wearing UW caps and shirts. I assume these folks are from UW.

None of them wore masks. None. Not even dangling masks on their chins. No bandanas. It’s as if we haven’t been in the middle of a pandemic for a couple of months already.

The trails were narrow, probably fit three people shoulder to shoulder. We had to move way off the trail to keep our distance. We prefer not going off trail. 

So please folks, just wear a damn mask and share the trail.

96lm90,"Dear freshmen,","A message from my friend with not enough karma:

“Please stop asking about schedules/courses.

I know you guys are freshman and are worried about maintaining a good GPA but college is about learning independence. The point of freshman year is to make decisions for yourself and learn about yourself and grow as a person. Your first year in college, you will run into difficulties, and you have to learn to manage it. 

Asking if 3 STEM class is manageable is a silly question. You know yourself better than we know you. If you are willing to put in the effort and time, you will be fine. If you don't think you can manage your time correctly, maybe take less STEM and explore other interests. Stop worrying if a particular class will be challenging, if it's a prerequisite class, you're going to take it eventually.

All in all, most classes will be hard. You will need to put in enough effort to do well in your classes.”

It’s crazy and surprising to see so much variety but I can’t help but realize that how much it can pigeonhole people to hang out with only their own ethnic groups.

#2. Would any one of these campuses have a social aspect to it. As in are there any social events and opportunities to meet new people.

#3. If I were to transfer to UWT, would I be receiving the same education as at UWS since I'm first generation and have no idea which school is right for me.

#4. If I do transfer to UWT, would it be possible to cross-transfer campuses from UWT to UWS?

Edit: 

Should've added this as it wasn't at the top of my mind.

7lqs7s,"Applying as a transfer student to CS, have lots of questions","So I currently go to a four-year state school on the east coast (nothing prestigious) and am interested in transferring to UW for CS. I feel that I'm not challenged at my current university. It's a huge party school and that's not really my scene. As pretentious and elitist as it sounds, I feel diosyapointed in myself for attending a university with the kind of people that attend my current school. Thus, I want to attend a university with excellent academics and a strong CS program.

Anyways, I applied to transfer last semester for aerospace engineering, and was rejected. I was a mechanical engineering major at the point and believed that I was interested in doing aerospace engineering. I have since switched to CS since I don't really want to be doing stress analyses for the rest of my life and am more interested in CS anyways. Since I switched majors, I am a freshman in terms of my major, so I am planning on transferring to UW as a sophomore. I selected to apply directly into the major as a transfer student, since I will have pretty much all of the prerequisites done (see questions below).

My GPA is much better this semester (~3.8/3.9 this past semester, 3.5 the semester before that, and a 3.0 my first year) after switching to CS. I think part of this that I decided I would give pre-med a shot, and that has given me the motivation to push for a 4.0. Without pre-med, my mindset was that I'd be able to get a job right out of college with my degree and work experience, and that I'd be fine with anything above a 3.0. Thus, there wasn't any motivation for pursue a higher GPA and that I could put in the minimum amount of work and get above a 3.0. But now I've proven to myself that I can get a good GPA!

Anyways, here are my questions:

1.  Unfortunately, my calculus courses did not cover double integrals or a few of the topics that MATH 126 covers. This shouldn't be a problem, should it? Luckily our intro to CS courses also cover Java, so they should count as CS 142 and 143. 

2. How competitive is it to transfer directly into CS as an out of state student (I put down informatics as my second major)? I have decent ECs (IMO) and a decent GPA (at least from this past semester). While I think that applying to UW and not applying for CS directly may be easier admissions wise, I don't want to be stuck with having nothing to do for a semester while I wait to apply for CS once I'm there (if that makes sense). Is that concern valid?

3. It shouldn't be an issue that I applied for a different major last year and was rejected, would it? One of the things I'm planning to address the fact that I keep switching majors in my essay, and say how switching to CS gives me the potential to take part in all of these industries that I might be interested in.

4. I'm currently a pre-med student, but I'll probably drop this if I transfer to UW to focus on CS, since I imagine the courses will be much harder and I won't have as much time to spare on taking pre-med prerequisites. Plus, I don't think I'm that interested in health anyways, now that I'm interested in doing CS. Should I mention the fact that I'm a pre-med student in my application? I'm worried that saying I will drop it in pursuit of CS is a red flag.

5. Is it okay to re-use passages from my essay from my last application? There are a few passages that I am proud of and are still accurate today that I am interested in using.

6. Is there anything like a student-run angel investing fund on campus? I'm pretty involved with one at my school currently, but, as much as I love what we do, I don't want it to be the only thing that keeps me at my current university. I'd love to participate in one at UW (if I get in).

7. The application says that I'll need to submit an application for my major along with the transfer application since I'm applying directly to the major. But, the CS school website says that students do not need to submit a separate application. Which is true?

xjpj0e,Is UofWa actually toxic?,"Hi all,

So as an incoming transfer student, I have heard absolute HORROR stories about UofWa being extremely toxic, especially in the STEM field, which I so happen to be in. My sister attended here and even said that her ""friends"" were hesitant to help her because they feared she would get a better score than them

However, despite just finding this out, I'm worried, to say the least. I want to be in a community where everyone can help each other and be able to ask questions without feeling less-than. I don't want to be a part of a culture where I feel the need to constantly compete with my friends and peers. I want a supportive community where I'm able to be vulnerable when I truly don't understand something and ask for help.

If anyone has experienced this, please comment on some good ways to block out this certain culture. I want my college experience to be fun, not competitive. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/xjpj0e/is_uofwa_actually_toxic/,36,11

if i score great on the WSA and have pretty good personal statements is there any chance for me at all? 

im confident i can 4.0 cc classes, but i heard those don’t matter to foster for calculating your gpas and stuff

i probably won’t get in to foster, so i’d also like to apply for the econ major… but idk if i’ll get into that either. fml.

does anyone have any stories or advice? are the odds of getting into foster really that bad with my stats? maybe i can transfer to uw bothell’s business school? would i still be able to take classes at foster if i did that?

im just feeling pretty dejected and frustrated at myself, and idrk what to do. ik im a better student than this, i just don’t know whats wrong. i did really well in high school.

1bv58ns,UCSB vs UW Seattle,"I am stuck between UCSB vs UW Seattle. I got into UCSB for Pre-Economics & Accounting, and UW Seattle as a Direct Admit to the Foster School of business. I am a California Resident but cost isn't that much of an issue.

**School: UCSB Vs UW**

US News Rank: 35 Vs 40

Acceptance Rate: 29% Vs 46%

Total Cost Per Year: 40k Vs 60k (oos)

Location: Beach Town Vs Big City

Student-Faculty Ratio: 17:1 Vs 21:1

Overall, UCSB appears better in every meaningful statistic, however, the specific program is what I am more curious about. In 2023, UW Foster's starting salary for undergrads was 76.6k in 2023 with a 94% placement after 3 months, and the average signing bonus was 8.5k. This makes it significantly better than UW overall.

On the other hand, UCSB Pre-Economics & Accounting major has very little data available online and feels like a bit more of a gamble. Does anyone have any data on UCSB accounting major? I am leaning towards Foster since their MBA is ranked 20th on US news (which is still relevant to the undergraduate program) and since I have concrete data on outcomes. Some data on UCSB's accounting/econ program and any possible first-hand experience would be super helpful before making a decision.

Extra: I have also been waitlisted by Michigan and UCSD and was wondering how they would stack up in case I am offered a spot. I am also considering getting an MBA in the future and am not sure how that would impact my decision, I am assuming it won't but not I am not sure what MBA admissions are like.",Admissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bv58ns/ucsb_vs_uw_seattle/,8,0

I would really like to go to Udub, but I’m going into nursing. And everything I have heard about nursing has been that it’s extremely rigorous application process, barely any people get in, and many people never get in. So with that, I feel very discouraged about my chances of getting in. I won’t have all my prerequisites done by the time i graduate, so I was planning to apply and (if i get in) finish them there and maybe i get into the actual nursing program. I also took honors classes my first two hs years. What I’m worried about is the fact that I don’t have many extracurriculars that usually make a student look amazing. I stopped doing sports with Covid and never really started back up because I started working. And with working, and running start full time (1.5 hour commute each way as well), i didn’t have time to really get involved in anything. I have volunteered at a river cleanup a while ago but i don’t know if i can verify the hours or anything. I go to the gym regularly and used to box for about a year, but those are outside of school and they don’t look that great. During the summer I help out with my family’s small business full time, so i don’t have time for a passion project. As well, I don’t think I will qualify for much financial aid, even though my family is low income, because you have to count the business’s value, so I can’t really afford to go to a private school (i will have to take out loans even for udub).

I want to apply for direct admission to Comp sci, because I initially heard that if you don't get into the major, they won't reject you because of it. However, I recently heard from a current student that they have started rejecting those who do not get into comp sci so students wouldn't ""hang around waiting for something they will never get into,"" and have to go through an appeal process and change majors.

If this is the case, wouldn't it be better to decide on something that doesn't require direct admit (ex. Informatics, which I would be more than willing to do) if I don't have a stellar chance at majoring in CS? I would also like to know my chances of getting into UW in general.

Now I am back because I checked out some 13"" ultrabooks (Dell XPS 13, Macbook, & Macbook Pro) and realized how small 13 inches is. I am used to a 17"" gaming laptop and dual 27"" monitors.

My plan was to get a top-of-the-line ultrabook that I would use for the two years at Foster then at least two more at my job (currently aiming for general manager). 13 inches looked too small for good productivity though. I wouldn't be able to have two windows open (such as Word + a PDF). I'm thinking 13"" is a better size for school because of the reduced weight and for fitting onto small classroom desks, but for work, with a real desk, 15"" seems much more productive.

Does you guys share your good and bad experiences with 13"" and larger laptops at school?

1ugv1z,CAREFUL!!! faulty UW software is misleading,"Be very careful not to rely on the General Education Requirement Course Search tool located in the student guide at:

http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/genedinq.html

This software is extremely easy to use. However, its yet another piece of poorly-written UW software released without testing or any indication that it doesn't really work. 

Though Academic advising says it locates all open courses, it misses many open UW courses. It doesn't locate any open online courses which fit just about anyone's schedule, or open courses where the professors don't specify times and puts ""to be arranged"". Often, these professors will arrange days and times that all students can attend later or will work out with students when to meet. These are among the best courses at the UW since they are usually small with very caring professors. 

You can find some of the UW's online courses at

http://www.pce.uw.edu/online-learning/

This probably isn't all of them. 

Again, beware of this tool. You'll miss hundreds of UW classes that might be perfert for you if you use it. Instead, use your advisor and the ENTIRE UW list at:

* moderately rigorous course load (a couple APs)
* my extracurriculars are more related to my hobbies and interests that not related to CS
* my volunteering experience is around 20 hrs at a local food bank
* 1200 PSAT score (I'm planning to take the SAT this December)
* all my summers so far have consisted of extra courses through my school that I'm doing to get credits out of the way

“Look at Greek Row, we’re fucked. Fall online confirmed.”


“At this rate, Winter is definitely gonna be online as well.”


“CHEM just made two labs online, it’s over. We’re going fully online for the year”


“I don’t mind a fully online year tbh, why even go in-person at this point. They’re forcing it”


“online school is honestly pretty fun, why was in-person ever a thing smh”


Fucking relax, y’all. 😂😂😂 We’re going Hybrid this coming quarter, and most likely in-person in Winter & Spring. Quote. Me. On. That. 😎


And to those who REALLY BADLY want to go fully online for the full year or some shit (the fuck?) because you prioritize easy 4.0’s over happiness and mental health, transfer to **University of Phoenix**. Ana Marie not listening to you doomsday headasses. Next thing I know, y’all gonna make petitions to go online and ruin it for the rest of us.

Give it a break and enjoy your summer. We’ve done well to mitigate the virus here in Western Washington and will be rewarded for it.


See y’all in the Fall.


/rant


Edit: I think I have to re-iterate. I’m not asking that we go fully in-person in the Fall, and nor am I asking that every sub-50 student class goes in-person. I’m asking that the current time schedule stands, and I think it’s very very likely since few classes are fully in-person. I have no idea if UW plans to add more classes to the in-person list before Fall, and not sure if that’d be wise. It’s perfectly fine how it stands, no reason to go fully online every damn quarter until we have 0 cases.


Edit 2: okay originally I was exaggerating about people saying online the full year but apparently people DO want that?! Get a fucking grip! 😂😂😂

Edit 3: Can y'all imagine a full year of online? Like, just thinking about it..I would probably end up with some major depression. I'd definitely postpone graduation to '22, that's for sure!

In any relationship, even with strangers, communication is key, instead of letting things reach a boiling point for yourself or the other person.

If I could shoot the person I was 10, or hell, even 5 years back, I would out of absolute disgust, but that's what we as humans do- we evolve from our mistakes and change over time.

- GPA 3.2 ( pandemic freshman year basically failed but had 4.0, 3.5+ grades ever since) 
- Associates Degree/Running Start 
- 4 AP/honors classes when I was in the high school
- Publicity manager of FCCLA club for a single year before I did running start 
- Vice president of PTK Honors Honors society at the Community College I attend for two years 
- Senior class Treasurer in ASB (1yr) 
- Basketball for two years 
- Varsity Lacrosse for three years 
- Work part time at a small business for two years 
- No ACT/SAT 
- First Gen college student 
- Mixed race (White/Pacific Islander/Asian) 
- Low Income house hold

I’m really nervous because this has been my dream for a long time but the school gets more and more selective each year, and I feel like my stats are all over the place- like I’m not consistently great at one thing so they’ll reject me. so lmk what you guys think, possible or pipe dream? 

Also in my personal statement I was going to mention how I actually work two jobs under the table because the state would take my families food benefits if I worked legitimately…..

9th grade:

English I Honors
Biology Honors

10th grade:

(Community College) Physics for non-science majors (this was the only class available for me at the time)
(Community College) US History II and American Government
(Community College) Intro to 3D computer animation 
AP Language and Composition

12th grade:

AP Literature
AP Studio Art
AP Computer Science A
AP Calculus AB

Also, since I haven’t taken my 12th grade schedule plan just yet (I’m still a Junior), I could theoretically switch my remaining two classes (I didn’t list them but they are Intro to Game Design and Engineering Ia and Ib) to college Physics which I could then take online as a Running Start student.

ao8p3g,Message From Ana Mari Cauce,"Dear UW Community, 

We are all in shock and sadness over the death of a UW student after a tragic fall on the Seattle campus yesterday. I have spoken with the student’s father and my heart is with her grieving family and friends and all who knew her. 

This was a tragic accident, one that is felt very personally by me and all the UW staff who work to keep our campus safe, every day. Resources for anyone who needs support can be found in the links below. 

The decision to operate or suspend operations on our campus during inclement weather is ultimately my responsibility. It is made after careful assessment and deliberations with our facilities managers and the safety of our campus community is always the determining factor. By Wednesday, we determined that campus operations could resume. It is important to note that as a public, residential space, our campus is never “closed” and that there will always be people on the grounds. Our crews work around the clock to keep our campus roads and sidewalks as clear of snow and ice as possible, regardless of whether normal operations are suspended. 

With more snow in the forecast, we are already assessing campus conditions — the safety of our community will continue to be our priority. If you know of or become aware of places on campus where additional clearing or signage is needed, UW Facilities asks that you contact their customer care team to identify areas to service. I also encourage everyone to sign up for UW Alerts for updates and notifications about campus safety. 

The weather conditions we are experiencing are unusual and challenging for Seattle due to the combination of snow and below-freezing temperatures that prevent a full melt. Please take extra precautions, move a little slower, have patience with delays and watch out for your friends and colleagues. 

Please do know that we are doing, and will continue to do, all that we can to keep you and all who visit our campus as safe as possible. 

Sincerely,


Ana Mari Cauce

However, I do not understand why UW is still asking students for full tuition when all the learning is done at home without getting any access to the facilities provided by UW. UW President is making millions of bucks by the way which I do not understand why they feel the necessity to leech off of us for the full tuition. Also, times like this, I think the acamdeia people need to reconsider about the upcoming finals for this quarter. I am not using the protest as an excuse to pass on the finals but more of can you guys for once be realistic and take the side of the students and the things we are going through. This protest is effecting many of us and I know that times are not easy for everyone to be in the right state of mind to push through school. One of my friend I know wanted to part of the peaceful protest but she realized she has classes to pass and had to pass up. I know as a student academic is important but this protest is more than just Floyd's death. It is fighting for justice and the mistreatment happening in the society for so many years and this is the time to put the government back in its right place and have them stop treating working and middle class like shit.

I would feel fucking horrible if my parents were paying for my tuition and then not putting in all the effort I can. There are soooo many other people who wish they could be here but cant because of financial issues. Some people need to grow up and make smarter decisions. 

And im not saying im perfect. I slack off and procrastinate but I have never considered not taking a final or doing all that I could to get a good grade and understand the course material. (PS: I pay for my education by working and scholarships not one penny comes from my parents).

In-State Community College Coursework:

\- CS 141 and 143 (Java I and II)

\- Linear algebra, calculus 3, diff eq.

\- Second-year physics I

\- English 101 and 235

\- Bunch of other stuff that probably won't matter too much

\- 2 years of Latin (Latin 2 was the only class I took my sophomore year)

since i was like 10, ive wanted to go to uw for computer science but when i actually did some research into uw’s cse program it seems kinda bad. i mainly want to do something in the software engineering or game design scene but i heard that uw seattles program is mainly oriented towards research and not practical coding. am i just completely wrong? for anyone thats gone through the allen school for cse could you give me a little run down of how your experience was and what u came out learning from it? 

I read a little about the uw bothell program and it seems more about programming and exploring career paths in coding. obviously id rather go to uws if there program is the same tho.

another option too is to just go to a different university like western washing university which also seems more about programming as a whole.

I also heard a little bit about possibly going to the school of information and pursuing an informatics major. it seems to me that its just about user interface and improving media apps but again i could be completely wrong. if someone wants to touch up on that it would be super helpful. 

i guess what im trying to say is is uws cse program good for software engineering? or is it probably in my best interest to go to another school that may be more focused on programming? thanks redditors :^)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/de60db/cse_program_vs_informatics/,28,0

If you guys have your writing gen ed left, I would recommend taking ESS 101 for it in Spring. The writing portion is an essay on top of the normal assignments. I found it to be more interesting and fun compared to a typical English writing course. The class size is big so there will be a chance for everyone to register (online & in person). You won't need prior Geology knowledge to do well. If you have a high workload next quarter, this is a great class to sign up for. Professor Swanson is also the most enthusiastic prof I have had so far; no lectures are boring! You do one lab a week, a short reading, and there are two exams. There are also field trips and other extra credit assignments!

Now that the CDC is recommending ""universal masking for teachers, staff, students and visitors in schools, regardless of vaccination status and community transmission of the virus"" I'm planning to take fall quarter off.

I've followed the science, I've masked up, I've gotten vaccinated.  I've returned to not wearing a mask. 

But then this dropped.

But now I'm tired of these masks, I'm tired of the isolation, I'm tired of the fear, I don't expect I'll return to the devoted quarantining that I practiced for the past 16 months.  I've had an incredibly hard time staying motivated in my coursework with this whole ""remote learning"" fiasco. 

I've been vaccinated.  *We've* all been vaccinated.  We will not be able to attend classes unless we attest that we are vaccinated.  Does the vaccine work or doesn't it?  Who are we, the vaccinated, protecting?  Am I supposed to wear a mask so that if I get COVID, I'm protecting the anti-vaxxers?  Not worth it in my mind.

No more gym w/o a mask?  No library without a mask?  We're going to go back to all of that?  No thanks.  I'd rather opt out of fall quarter.  If it's so dangerous, classes should still be remote, anyways.  This is not worth the *massive* amount of money I'm paying for this bullshit college experience.

From the CDC: “In rare occasions, some vaccinated people infected with a Delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others.”

Sure, I get it.  But this is no longer our pandemic.  As the Director of the CDC said, this is now a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” But she's worried that ""vaccinated people who are in a place with substantial or high transmission could contract a breakthrough infection, and could pass the virus onto unvaccinated family members or those with weakened immune systems and others most at risk.""  Not my problem.  I'm vaccinated.  You're vaccinated.  I'm not going to give it to you.  You're not going to give it to me.

And now that I've written this incredibly self-centered post, I still see the importance of protecting those that are vulnerable, including the IDIOTS that have just decided not to get vaccinated.  So, I guess I'll see you all on campus.

izn6iy,Math Placement for 120,"Hello all

I've applied to UW for Winter 2021, but am preparing to take the Self Guided Math Placement so I can be ready to take MATH 120 on my first quarter.

Currently, I'm working through Khan Academy and doing pretty well (I'm working through Algebra II and will probably work on Precalc if I have time -- I like maths!). My question to you all is are there resources where I can get a 'practice' test? I know that UW has a couple of sources for review which I will probably use if nothing else, but they have the answers directly next to the questions which kinda makes it difficult. 

I've taken practice Accuplacer tests and I'm nearly 100% confident that I've studied enough to get a half-decent score, but I'm not sure how well these translate. I'm also not sure if I'm able to retake the Self Guided Math Placement before I start UW (acceptance permitting) in case I end up in a lower class than I had hoped. 

TL;DR 

-- Are there any resources with an actual test practice that are similar to the Self Guided Math Placement, or are the resources on UW my best option?

-- Can I retake the Self Guided Math Placement before taking a maths class if I'm unhappy with my placement?

Thanks in advance!

What I've understood from their website is that it is an interdisciplinary program for students interested in more than one majors. Correct me if I'm wrong, as I think I don't understand what it is. 

I'm applying for Electrical Engineering (first choice) and Computer Engineering (second choice). I'm interested in Brain-Machine Interfaces and might work on them in future. This will require knowledge in other fields like Neuroscience, Material Science etc. 

Do you think I should apply for the honors program? Also, will applying for the honors program affect the chances of my admission into UW. I saw a video in which they said: ""admission into the honours program is contingent on admission into UW"". I don't understand what that means.

78hy7r,UW International Student Application,"Hello everyone! 

I am an international student applying to the University of Washington from Russia. I have a few things to clarify, and I am convinced that this is an appropriate place because some of my questions are specifically about UW.

Major: International Relations/Political Science.

Here are some stats: 
1. Ethnicity: Russian. I believe it might help because there are very few (if any) Russian at the University of Washington. Here comes diversity. 
2. GPA: I believe it is something around 4.6-4.7/5.0 (on 5 scale). I attend very rigorous school in my country, so it is really hard to be a stellar student, taking into account that everyone is obliged to follow a national curriculum. Anyway, GPA is probably within the range of acceptance. 
3. TOEFL. I have got 85 overall, with 28 out of 30 on the Writing section. Some of you might say that it is not that much, but I personally believe that it is quite good; UW requires the minimum of 76, so I am okay on this requirement. I have also taken IELTS, and I have scored 6.5 overall. Still not sure which one to send. 
4. SAT. I have had a bad experience taking the SAT exam because I am not used to such system. I mean, it was quite hard to do 60 problems in like 60 minutes. No way. You would say it is all about strategies and time-management, but those who say these things were educated in the US and they were taught these things (the way things are teacher in every country is different, just saying). Well, I scored 1060, which is above the national average (and I should be proud of myself because many U.S. students did worse than I did). I have not studied for it, by the way. Of course, you must think that I am very dumb, but this is who I am. Yes, I did badly on the test, but I am very industrious, willing to work and passionate. It is just not the way I should be judged. And here is the thing: UW does not require SAT/ACT for international admission. I am taking ACT just for a change (maybe, it will be better). But I do not really plan to send it to the UW. 
5. Essays: I have done a good job writing my essays. They are almost completed. I assume they are quite good, but I also don't have a explicit idea what I am expected to write about, though. 
6. ECs: Not much to say about it. In Russia, the priority is given to academics, so we do not really have any clubs, organizations, volunteering, etc. Nonetheless, I have done some things outside the classroom. First of all, I have served as Steam Community Translator @ Valve Software translating Valve games into Russian. I was some kind of leader when it came to proofreading Russian translations. It is so because I had the deepest understanding of how the Russian language was structured. Secondly, I have participated in many All-Russian Olympiads in Social Sciences (Law, Russian History, Sociology, Russian, English). I have done pretty well on them, and they are really rigorous. I guess it is worth mentioning on my college application. Secondly, I have been playing as a goalkeeper for a local soccer team. We are not really good, but since the US college want to see that you are active, I guess it is worth telling them that I am also sporty. I might also mention that I am a participant of the UN Model. So, am I good in terms of ECs? 

Please chance me for the UW based on the information above. Thank you in advance. 

Here are few questions that concern me: 
1. Why UW does not require SAT for international students? Does it mean that they are basically cash cows and they are treated this way? I do not think that is cool.
2. Will I be able to find any job in the United States after graduation if I major in International Relations or Political Science? Provided that I also speak Russian fluently and + one more foreign language. My main goal is to stay in the US, so it is really important. I do not mind hearing from international students, and I would especially appreciate your responses. 
3. How is the school overall? Tell me your experience. 

Thank you for your attention and patience.

So for my Freshman Autumn quarter at UW, I've enrolled in CSE 142, Math 126, and English 111.  I've already taken AP Computer Science and took a Calc III course at a local community college, so this shouldn't be too academically challenging (just mostly review).  I'm mainly wondering if this will leave me with too much free time?  I'm only at 14 credits, so are there any other (small-ish) courses I could add-on that would be fun, informative, or help make my application to CS look better?

The lack of a common area for each floor, and only one common meeting place for the entire area from what it seems, has me worried in the event that the 7 other people I've been randomly assigned to don't turn out well.

I know I can still have a social life outside of my dorm if I put myself out there, but I'm worried about missing out on something, especially during freshman year.

277t4x,Honors physics and EE admissions,"I'm going to UW next year as a pre-engineering major. Looking at the honors physics 121-123 details, it looks like it would be a lot more enjoyable, with smaller class sizes, better instructors, and a focus on quantum mechanics and relativity. Can anyone who has taken it talk about the difficulty and workload of it compared to the normal classes?

I also have the problem of admission to the EE department that I want to sort out. I want to apply ASAP, and the science pre-requisites are CHEM 142, and PHYS 121/122. Honors physics only runs in a specific order from Autumn to Spring quarters, which means that I can't take CHEM 142 first quarter. If I take chemistry Spring quarter, then I lose priority registration for PHYS 123 in Autumn of the next year, and I also can't do honors for the last section. However, this lets me apply to EE by the end of freshman year. I could also take two science classes in one quarter, but I've read around here that it is a very bad idea to try that. On the other hand, if I take all of honors physics during freshman year, and take chemistry in fall of sophomore year, I can get all of the classes I want, but it delays the application date. This worries me, due to the possibility of having to re-apply several times if my GPA is too low, and it's cutting it close to the beginning of the major-specific courses. Does anyone have any experience with trying to cram in courses like this, or am I making too big of a deal about applying late?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/277t4x/honors_physics_and_ee_admissions/,8,1

uawj5h,New thrifting app for UW students !,"I stumbled across a QR code on campus the other day and found out about Thrifthouse which is an app made by some MIT students that allows you to sell your clothes, shoes, textbooks, appliances, etc. to other students at your college campus. You need to log in with your student ID and everything so it is very secure and only reaches other UW students. It makes selling shit so easy because you don’t have to package and ship out your item like you would for Depop. You just need to meet up at like paccar or ode and that it. Anyway I’ve been using the app for awhile and have been selling stuff here and there just because the creators of the app sometimes give you free money to spend on the app as an incentive to buy and sell things. The only thing is, as with any startup, not a lot of people know about the app so there’s not many new items being sold or even being listed on the app on a weekly basis. 

So I am here to tell all of y’all to GET THRIFTHOUSE. 

I feel like this app has the potential to be a mainstream UW student app just because it’s so convenient and allows you to make a few bucks if your moving out and trying to get rid of things. Anyway, if any of you guys are interested here’s the link:) I feel like I’m an ambassador or something but I swear I actually just love the concept of this app so much.

1bzciqi,Idea: Be nice to the people you want to convince,"EDIT: I am making the exact same mistake, the title is ironically a lesson I should listen to. The original post was a cathartic angry release and it was more about me feeling better than addressing the audience (""HUB vandals"", etc). 

Especially w/Gaza war and killing, it's too much death to wrap your head around and I think that it is probably unleashing shock/defensiveness/cognitive dissonance worldwide. I got in my own way by just indulging in being pissed and I respectfully do believe vandals did as well.

It is much easier to cross the bridge and change your mind (political opinion, etc) when the other person is inviting you in with open arms. I have been in the situation of needing to change before and you can psychologically feel the difference between when ""agreeing"" is framed as ""defeat"" and when it's ""joining your friends to do the right thing"".

I know that it is possible to get ourselves out of the way (vandals, reactionaries, me yapping and malding etc) and keep keep keep telling the people we know about all the bombing and killing in Gaza. It should be impossible to ignore.

This is exactly why I was writing about ""being careful about how we do it"". I think that it's important to be measured in your activism because you can appeal to people's emotions, beliefs etc without inviting pride, defensiveness, ego etc to the door.

This is one of those massively important and sickening historical events, and as a consequence it is so easy to frame as something to get on board with rather than using shame or force. We are very lucky to not have to use force in our situation.

I believe you (vandals) are righteous motherfuckers... you make me think about how much I'm willing to be uncomfortable... AND I think the expression of that has impacts; you can certainly see them below.

ORIGINAL POST:

This is addressed to ""the HUB vandals"", to distinguish between those who were trying to show the world the horrible truth about Gaza, and those who were ideologically masturbating with Sharpies.

Israel's reputation thrives off being known as the ""orderly security force"", as opposed to the ""frothing radical Palestinian terrorists"". This is a lie. Regardless, western media, American politicians, and the public are looking closely for examples.

This is an unfair box to be put in. You cannot be complacent sign-holders, and at the same time, you cannot be window-breakers. Civil disobedience is the remedy, this is a PERFECT opportunity for a sit-in. The cause needs the attention.

You can really tell how much someone gives a shit by how much they're willing to decenter themselves. And it seems that some of you really hate your audience. Yelling at reporters, slinging slurs, etc. Openly harassing anyone who came to PUBLICIZE YOUR DEMONSTRATION. (The goal)

When directly offered media attention... by the THE STATE-SPONSORED UNIVERSITY NEWSPAPER... which was going to show up, and has the largest audience... you cut off your nose to spite your face, and decided the Daily was ""too liberal"". And now the people you yelled at have a statement out about how much you yelled at them.

The vandalism is the perfect example. You could have covered the HUB wall to wall in flyers, communicated just as well, and then you would have had plenty of photos of UW staff taking them down. The cause gets the attention for longer, the administration has less to slander you with. You GAIN ATTENTION and SYMPATHY (support. for the cause. remember the cause?) at the cost of IMMEDIATE CATHARTIC RELEASE.

These choices were clearly made to show that ""the movement"" would not be moderated or constrained by authority. These are choices of ideological purists, tribalist book-thumpers, self-interested folks.

Have you noticed how protestors in worse circumstances-- PALESTINIANS, FOR EXAMPLE-- seem to be chiefly interested in impact, effect, and visibility? There is no armed struggle to wage on Red Square, so surely you are responsible for crafting the most-heard protest, not the most-strong.

There is NO EITHER-OR CHOICE between ""caring about optics"" and ""denouncing civilian carpet-bombing"", actually, and Lenin's spirit is not judging you from the sky. 

How can you so desperately want power and refuse to level with your audience? 1960s revolutionaries knew how to strategize to defeat the Western media machine, you guys just seem to know how to get mad. To those stubborn leftists who are putting themselves before their cause, I hope you are ignored in the public square for as long as you can't figure out how to accept what you can't control. 

(If you are unfamiliar with the killing in Gaza, you ought not to be hated for it, and you are welcome under the umbrella of protecting innocent life. The Wikipedia page for the ""Israel–Hamas war"", while Westernized, is a much better picture of the situation than what American news media will promote)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bzciqi/idea_be_nice_to_the_people_you_want_to_convince/,7,40

For extracurricular, I am in a volunteering club, a few programs since high school, and doing research at UW.

So I need ya all's advice on quite a few things:

1. What is the avg GPA for ochem and what advice do you have to do well? Is it possible to have  a 3.2 in chem 237?
2. Is it really manageable to maintain a 3.5+ GPA in UW?
3. Is it true that upper-level classes are easier?

bgmdlp,Is competing for CS worth a shot in my case?,"I'm a freshman applicant and current student at SPSCC. I have a 3.9 GPA, 4.0 in STEM prereqs, iamverysmart, etc. etc. I want to study computer science. However, I have been rejected from a number of CS programs, including DTM CS at UW.

My choices have boiled down to:

- UW (Seattle):
Pros: Can actually compete for majors. Seattle is the best location for me personally.
Cons: No guarantees.

- UCSD:
Pros: Backup majors are tier 2. To not call them top-tier is splitting hairs. Location is ideal for career.
Cons: CS transfer admissions are literally random. Once you pass the cutoff GPA, you have no influence.

- WSU:
Pros: They'll let me study CS
Cons: They're WSU. I don't think I need to say more here. :) I've lived in Pullman. It's not the greatest place for me.

Going to WSU seems silly. Shade-throwing aside, they'll eat me up should I decide transfer out of either UCSD or UW, so picking one first makes sense. So the question is then: Should I just settle on a backup and make the best of it at UCSD, or try my hand at pre-CS at UW?

P.S.: Tried to keep the bragging to a minimum, but it seems exceptionally relevant to my projected performance that I have about a decade hobby/open-source experience in CS/software engineering.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/bgmdlp/is_competing_for_cs_worth_a_shot_in_my_case/,37,7

70inew,What are my chances of getting into UW (NOT Trolling),"I had posted about this before, but I'd like to go a little more in depth.

So I royally screwed up when I was in high school. I graduated in 2009, but my final GPA was 2.6.

Anywhew, for a litany of reasons (mainly alcohol/drug abuse and major depressive disorder), I continued my terrible academic streak with a stint at a state college in Connecticut, where I am originally from.   

I ended up essentially skipping out on all my classes for one semester, and did not return.

I just looked at my old transcript from this school, and I received one F, three W's (withdraws), and one N (never attended). 

That was in 2010.

In spring of 2016, after living in Washington for a year, I decided to give college a more serious go. I am two quarters away from finishing my DTA Associates Degree from Whatcom Community College, I currently have a **4.0 GPA** and plan on keeping it until I transfer. 


 Obviously I plan to elaborate on why my High school and early college careers were such disasters, I was attending rehabilitation for a period in high school, my parents divorced, mother diagnosed with cancer, general angsty teen stuff.... constantly struggling to maintain a sense of well being. 

I plan on highlighting my strengths in my application as well, duh.

 I don't want to bore you too much with them, so I'll be brief:

Basically around 2012 I started working for a high profile entertainment promotions/marketing company named ""Celebrity Access"". I worked there for 4 years, was promoted to Tour Date Manager after the first year. This was essentially the type of career that a Com major like myself seeks. In other words, I have already worked in the field. 

I began to realize that it was possible to make it without a college degree, however the further I went in the field the more I recognized the importance of having a formal college education. These days, you are always given more opportunities when you have that badge under your belt. 

That being said, I eventually left the job on good terms, to travel the country and find the right school, eventually finding myself in Washington state. 

Its been a roller coaster ride, but I am hoping that UW will see the stark contrast between my academic record as a kid, and my academic record now as a 26 year old. It truly is a night and day difference. 

What do you think my chances are of getting into UW?

Has anyone been in this situation before? If so, please share!

Do you think they will seriously take into account my first college stint when configuring my ""transfer GPA""? I don't think W's and N's can be taken into account, meaning the one F may be the only grade to potentially transfer (and haunt me). But come on! I've got a 4.0 now... 

Obviously there are a lot more things I could tell you about myself (volunteer work, passions, etc), but I think you get the gist. 

Edit - oh, and yes, around the age of 22 I did in fact take control of my own life. I do not drink or take drugs anymore. At 26, I can 100% say that I am the happiest I have ever been, more focused than ever!

b0c4ev,"To the girl loudly ""complaining"" in class about her worry of getting a 4.0 or 3.9","I get it. You worked hard all quarter and you want to maybe do a little bit of gloating about it. But doing so in a classroom full of people who are struggling to just pass the class with a 2.0... that's not cool. I know you're a freshman, but I can only hope for your sake that you learn the difference between *gaining an education* and *earning a degree* before you graduate. This isn't high school anymore. Grades aren't everything. Grades don't make a person. Grades are not an accurate measure of the skills and capacity of a person.  And to top it off by ostentatiously boasting about yours in a class full of struggling freshmen, many of whom might be first-generation college students, or students away from their home with little-to-no support structure? Do everyone a favor and brag to your parents or your friends instead, not loudly during class, repeatedly throughout the quarter.


Edit: My intent in this post was not to make leaping, unfounded accusations about the original student not being a first-generation student or being disadvantaged in someway herself. It was to illustrate the point that there are people who might be disadvantaged from circumstances outside their control who could become discouraged and on top of that because they’re not doing well. I also wasn’t meaning to attribute their success to something outside of their own work ethic and drive. 

Edit2: Since everyone is assuming I’m jealous: I’m not. I have a 4.0 as well. I just don’t agree with bragging openly at the risk of discouraging other people who aren’t doing as well. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/b0c4ev/to_the_girl_loudly_complaining_in_class_about_her/,55,146

1ryb8e,The future of the University of Washington?,"Hey Huskies,

I had an interesting conversation with a recruiter at Amazon (UW Alum), and she was talking a lot about the computer science program here at the UW, how it is amazing, but recently some professors are leaving (she mentioned a name and said he is a very popular researcher in the field, just don't recall the professors name) to other universities such as Stanford, or other elite schools. I myself am a freshman here at the UW, majoring in CSE, but after this convo with the recruiter, it is making me think, how is the UW doing right now? I know it is ranked top 50, or even 16th in some rankings, but as a school, is it doing better? or is it doing worse than previous years? This years incoming freshman class was the largest, so I'd imagine this is a good sign?

The university is constantly expanding, and for such a HUGE university, it is quite impressive how laid out the programs are here (excluding registration hehe). I was accepted to top CSE programs too (Columbia, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley) but I choose the UW mainly because of it being located in Seattle, as I want to be apart of the giant startup scene, and of course, it is a top 10 school in the field. But even with that aside, is the UW progressing in terms of being better? or is it really falling behind? 

Sorry for rambling and probably being redundant, I've been studying for finals, and figured it would be awesome to hear more from other huskies about this topic, as I definitely feel the university is heading towards the right path...

We're at the early stages of developing a doc management app to increase efficiency in a workspace by decreasing the amount of steps and time people have to look for their important documents. We're currently on our alpha stage, and would love feedbacks!

What are we looking for? We're looking to recruit 15 (> 23+) grad students who were or are freelancers, mid-late stage startup leaders, or dealing with clients, ideally with pain points in managing documents on Google Drive and Slack, to help us test the app. Volunteers will be testing the app during their free times throughout the alpha stage (beta will be released sometime in February 2021) and will be asked to give feedback once a week. If you find value in the app, we would love for you to continue throughout our product stages! In return, users joining during our exclusive alpha stage will get free access to our beta product, as we will be planning to charge people for beta!

We would love to share more information with you! Please PM me if you'd like to know more about this exciting opportunity or have any questions!

Hey there, r/udub. I'm torn. So, I'm an incoming freshman and I'm still deciding between where to go for university, and it's down to UW and UBC (yes, that UBC in Vancouver). I'd be majoring in Environmental Sciences in both schools, and they both seem to be strong in that. Cost wise, I'd be considered out of state/international (I'm coming from Maryland, so distance and travel costs are about the same) and UBC is a bit cheaper given the exchange rate, but UW did give me money all four years. So my costs would be like 39k comprehensive UBC vs 43k comprehensive for UW. And between the two cities, I like them both enough. Anyone else had a similar choice to make, and how did you make that?

pluoz8,"Is it ""evil"" to apply for scholarships when you don't need them?","Long story short, I basically have a full ride from financial aid and current scholarships. My parents both make around $35k each. They faced unemployment a while back, but now have full-time jobs.

Each quarter, I receive a reimbursement of ~$5k from the surplus of grants and scholarships I'm awarded. So I don't worry about loans or anything. I'm just apprehensive about applying for more scholarships, even though I had done so for a lot in the past, because I'm afraid I might be draining the opportunity from others who need it.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/pluoz8/is_it_evil_to_apply_for_scholarships_when_you/,13,11

Milo has also been invited to the inaugural ball. So if he decides to skip the UW event and go to the ball instead, he gets to go to the ball and he gets to say crazy liberals prevented him from coming to UW (by the way, UW and the police have bent over backwards to accommodate him, evacuating offices, bringing fire trucks, etc). So, win-win for him. Too bad for College Republicans, they are paying quite a bit of money to host the event.

I support Palestine, but condemn Israel - Palestine people are people too, you can't treat them like animals

I support saving all civilians, both Israel and Palestine, but fuck both Hamas and Benjamin (Israel PM) - Both elected governments and head of states are corrupted to its core and both sides of their civilians should elect a new government 

I support neither/rather not say - Pretty much you shut your mouth about this or don't have a final opinion yet

Ah shit here we go again - Another broken ceasefire for the 66th gazillion time and more human suffering that both sides blame each other for

9jtjzj,"Anybody living in Stevens Court J, K, L, M","Hello, 
I am a female, living in Stevens Court A, it's a 2nd floor 6 bedroom apartment, 9 months lease. I want to switch to a room in Stevens Court J, K, L, or M.

I know the A building is much older and you are thinking, ""why should I swap rooms with you?"". Reasons you may want to switch are: 

* you live on the ground floor and feel unsafe opening the window  for fresh air. If you swap rooms with me, you can open the window with no worry of someone breaking into the room.
* you live on the ground floor and feel hesitant to open the blinds for light because people will see into your room. If you swap rooms with me, you can open the blinds more freely as I have a room on the second floor, and it faces the back.
* you don't like sunlight shining into your eyes at 7:00 am. The room I have currently does not have that problem, as it does not face the direction of the sunrise.
* you don't like your roommates. You can get new ones if you move into my room.
* your roommates are too loud. The other people in my apartment keep to themselves mostly and I haven't really heard anything from them.
* your currant roommates are slobs. The people in my apartment are not.

The reason I want to move is because I am a very private person and sharing a bathroom with 5 other people is not ideal for me. 
If you are interested in switching but are worried that one bathroom is too small for 6 people please do not worry too much. During the past week, I have not seen anyone trying to use the bathroom while I was using it. If you are worried about someone using the bathroom when you also want to use the bathroom, there are two toilets/sinks/showers so there is enough room for everyone. 

If you wouldn't mind living in Stevens Court A, but think switching rooms is too much of a hassle I can pay the room switch fee for you, help you move, and pay you an extra $100 dollars for switching with me!

So if you are interested in switching, or know someone who is interested in switching, please PM me!

3tut0z,The difference between a 3.8 and a 4.0,"What do you guys think is the difference between a 3.8 and a 4.0? Is it just going the extra mile - always going to office hours, doing all the practice exam problems an extra time? Or do you think that people with 4.0's generally just understand the material better? Do you think there is a certain point with grades where getting a higher grade doesn't get you any tangible benefits? Is a 3.8 vs a 4.0 really a big deal?


I ask because I am applying to the math major for spring quarter, and my grades for the Calc series are: 4.0, 3.8, 3.9. Now in Calc 2 and 3 I felt that I really understood the material, but I had other engagements outside of class (work) and was taking Physics in addition to Calc. In the case of Calc 2 I actually underwent surgery during the quarter which caused me to get a lower grade on one of my midterms. I still feel that I could have done a lot better in those classes. The prerequisite GPA that they ask for on the app is your grades in the calc 12x series, correct?

Does UW not care about this? I mean, I have no problem with them hanging out here and all, but sometimes it makes me a little uncomfortable.

So far, I have noted:


*Location: 3rd Floor Ode

Person: Old white lady all in black.

Description: All she does is hang around on a computer on the quiet floor and watches videos all day. If she has to leave to get food or whatever, she will leave all her garbage/mess there for people not to take her spot. She sometimes answers the phone and answers it then after like 30 seconds finally goes to the bathroom to talk more comfortably.

Note: Ode staff never checks if she has a Husky Card after 7pm. Weird.


*Location: Suzzallo/Allen Basement

Person: Black dude with an oxygen tank.

Description: This guy just posts himself at the same desk here everyday and looks homeless. When the library closes, I see him just walking around campus at night. Not sure what he does until it closes.


*Location: Ode 1st & 3rd Floors

Person: Old Asian guy with a beanie

Description: This dude just hangs around Ode and just pulls his beanie over his head and just sleeps it off. Can be found on single chairs in first floor or 3rd floor.


*Location: HUB area on first floor where people take naps

Person: Old white lady

Description: This lady is just flat out crazy. If you sit by her, you'll just see her lying down on a couch, possibly sleeping. When she's not slumbering, you'll hear her talking to herself in an aggravated tone, which makes me a little uneasy for my safety at times.


*Location: Savery Hall

Person: Older white guy dress all in black.

Description: This guy hangs around in Savery during the night. He's dressed all in black with a black beanie covering most of his head that makes him look a little sketchy. I've seen him walking around campus sometimes, definitely not a student here. You can find him sleeping in Savery rooms throughout various times of the day since Savery apparently never locks their doors at night.


*Location:Ode

Person: Old white guy with a weird dress attire + bucket hat and glasses.

Description: This guy just lingers around Ode all day. I've made eye contact with him so many times and it feels like he just stares at me. Just plain creepy.

It is surely a pleasure and honor to be able to join this vibrant community of UW but I am now experiencing some troubles here. I am intl student and I am now having some daunting troubles of getting my visa to study at UW. I wrote this email to the ISS office in the hope to receive some help from them. For me, joining UW is sort of like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Also, it could be just my affection for every aspect and bit of this community which propels me to never give away my endeavors to work towards physically arriving here. I genuinely hope that you could take several minutes to read my story and possibly offer me some help or advice on my situation. I included details in the letter below:

Dear officers at UW ISS,

Greetings. I really hope that you could read my following words and consider them carefully, as it is absolutely something that directly pours out of a student who is now working desperately hard to get to UW and start his academic journey. As previously mentioned, my background is very different from most other students from UW and it could be something that affects my visa application. I applied for a student visa in Beijing, China today but unfortunately got rejected. I discussed the situation on my visa application form(DS160) about how I tried to overcome the bullying issues, which were seriously hindering my education and have cost me several years out of school, creating a gap in my education. But it seems that the visa officer did not read it in full detail at all(maybe because it was kind of long) and did not acknowledge my situation. It is likely that they only thought about the fact that I am older than other ordinary students and just rejected me, assuming that I have ***immigration intent*** because I am attending college at my current age. They may have concerns that I would overstay/work illegally once I got the visa.

But it is not the truth, bullying is nothing that should be considered my fault and I suffered a lot from the situation. I have seen quite a lot of people with similar situations never be able to rise up from the abyss where they were struggling. But God knows how I managed to overcome those exceedingly insurmountable obstacles and managed to come back from that. I think it is the innate determination that has pushed me finally to this stage of life. It is funny that the bullies and everyone else from my previous school here in China never made it to UW or other similarly prestigious universities. 

After I was forced out of school because of these incidents, I almost never ceased learning everything I had at hand. I have been so desperately working hard to absorb every bit of knowledge that I have in my sight. I have come back from that abyss where a significant number of people were crashed, hammered, and scattered in pieces and I do not want this to affect my hard-earned opportunities anymore. I want to go to UW without being accused of having immigration intent and being older than other students. I hope everything I worked up will eventually pay off for me and I know I am well worth it. I promise I will work hard amongst the top determined students you have ever seen in your career and I hope I can have a chance to make you and UW proud! I have come back from a student who did not know how to cope when forced out of a Chinese middle school to someone that finds his way to finish four years of U.S. high school in one year and successfully send himself to college. I want to keep being a miracle worker! I love UW and desperately want to come!

Sincerely, may I please have some assistance regarding my visa application from UW? Today, I was rejected by an officer in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, likely due to my previous visa rejections when going to a community college(I wanted to transfer to a 4-year university from a CC first) and the fact I am older than other undergraduate college students, which means I am 26 years old now. Could you please offer me some guidance and assistance regarding my unique situation? I really want to nail this visa application and successfully come to UW.

hxrbt9,I’m surprised,"I know US is kind of a hellhole right now, but can I just say how pleasantly surprised I am by the number of people who are wearing masks, at least around the campus area and the area near Canada-US border.
I’m currently back home in a suburban town in Canada and most people don’t wear masks here and no one says anything to them. Heck even the US border guards when I was going back to Seattle were wearing masks, but when I came back to Canada, the border guards there weren’t wearing them and they were sitting less than 2m from each other just chatting.

I think seeing so many “Karens” on social media refusing to wear mask and flaunting their white privilege can be frustrating and discouraging, and as much as Canadians like to feel we’re superior to the Americans, I think the majority of people in the US, or at least in Washington state are taking this seriously.

q4uebp,Let's have a serious discussion - What will be the necessary conditions for COVID to no longer impact our daily lives?,"Many parts of the country have already begun a transition back to normal, but I have observed the state of Washington, and apparently the students at UW, are very resistant to this transition. There has been this delta scare that has gone on now for a while, which has appeared to keep us in a perpetual loop of restrictions. 

What I want to address today, is what exactly the road to 'normalcy' will look like. There seems to be no mention of when the mask mandate will be lifted, or what the actual plan is for resolving our current state of affairs. Regarding vaccines, a strong majority of people are **already fully vaccinated**. The only people that aren't are:

* Those that are immunocompromised - this portion of the population is not going anywhere, there will always be people with weakened immune system and they will always be unfortunately over-susceptible to a **wide array of illnesses**, not just COVID.

* Those that are resisting getting vaccinated for their own moral or religious reasons - at the end of the day, there isn't much you can do about people who are delusional without going against their civil liberties and forcing them to do something against their will (which we need to ask ourselves, can we really resort to that?)

So as we have logically established, these two groups are not going anywhere, and by the way, neither are viral variants. Viruses adapt the same way any organic system would, and there will **always be** new mutations to deal with. 

-------------------

Also, before you tell me to ""suck it up and wear a mask"", I would like to point out that current restrictions extend way beyond just mask wearing:

* Many events (at least in my experience) that would normally be held in-person have still been virtualized, taking the human element and ability to meet other people out of them, despite the fact that a return to classes has been allowed. 

* Eating food in any area that is not an 'established common area' like the hub is disallowed (this doesn't even make any sense to me, if we have allowed people to eat maskless at the hub, why not in other indoor areas?)

* Currently you are not allowed to even drink coffee during classes (only water) due to having to pull down your mask to do so.

* Everyone must continue to wear masks even when inside gyms or fitness centers, and if you are engaging in a particularly aerobic task such as treadmill running, the issues with wearing a mask while doing so can range from miserable to straight up dangerous (asphyxiation). 

* I am not even sure why, but it seems like a lot of the students here feel compelled to wear their masks even when walking outside - I personally don't and I constantly feel like I am being stared at as if I am some sort of anti-vaxxer...

------------------

So now, to conclude, if all of these things have now reached a point of 'static equilibrium' and we still have all of these restrictions placed on us, I question how exactly we can ever contemplate the idea of returning back to some notion of normal. Now I ask all of you, what do you envision the roadmap might look like, or do you believe we should permanently live our lives as we are now? And please, stick to intelligent discussion.",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/q4uebp/lets_have_a_serious_discussion_what_will_be_the/,23,71

12lkdhm,Incoming Husky worried about getting RESCINDED,"I was recently admitted to the UW for the CS major and the honors program as an out of state student. My stats were fairly good before senior year (4.0, 1550 SAT + ECs). However, I really tanked hard starting this fall (especially after submitting college apps). I earned at least 3 Bs in my 1st semester and astonishingly received a D in AP CS A (I had no prior CS experience by the way). I stopped attending school consistently due to a string of numerous illnesses (flu, covid, staph infection) starting in November 2022 and that has led to me ""snowballing"" my lack of preparation for tests and school in general. 

In short, I am very worried about my 2nd semester grades (potentially dropping below 3.0) and whether or not I would be rescinded for this precipitous drop in academics, and I am unsure if my explanation to the admissions office about my illnesses would suffice.

r7ma9z,Husky Card Rant (keep scrolling),"Disclaimer:  I'm not looking for solution, as this is not a *real* problem.  I have just found the scenario humorous enough to write about while drinking a beer.  If you're a hater, kindly downvote and leave your negative comments to yourself.  I'm fortunate enough for the following situation to be the biggest issue I've got right now, following traffic & MGH wifi, and I do not take this seriously.

I'm a weird person and I don't like cords or plugging things in.  I love the fact that I can place my phone down and it starts charging instead of having to plug it in.  I made a decision on the air buds I use because the case can be charged wirelessly.  These simple pleasures I treasure.

I keep my husky card in my phone protector.  When I need to get on the light rail, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  When I need to get into UW buildings after hours, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  I love how seamless this is.  But then there is the IMA.  Because of COVID and a lack of lockers, I have to keep my stuff at my locker in the HUB, where I change and then jog to the IMA.  I don't like heavy things in my pockets when I'm running, so I don't bring my wallet, I don't bring my keys.  I bring my phone and that's it.

But at the IMA we have to *swipe* our ID card, to obtain access.  That's no biggie, I changed my phone protector to be one that has the cover that opens up like a book, which has a place to put ids, etc.  So, I get in, I take out my card, swipe, and then happily go to sweat and suffer.

A couple weeks ago the magnetic swipe stopped working.  The very kind and patient staff at the IMA happily took my card and manually looked me up to make sure I wasn't some degenerate WSU student or something, and then let me pass.  After this happened multiple days in a row, one of them suggested that I get a new card; I could tell their patience was wearing thin.  I thought, why should I get a new card?  It still works everywhere else?    When I need to get on the light rail, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  When I need to get into UW buildings after hours, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.

I found out that the reason is that magnetic swipes are prone to corruption when they are placed in electromagnetic fields like the ones created on wireless chargers.  I got a new card.  This time, I decided to just leave it in my wallet.  That worked fine.  Lightrail - still worked.  After-hour access - still worked.  I just hold my wallet next to readers instead of my phone.  But then - of course - I forgot one day to remember to take my card out of my wallet to bring with me to the IMA when I tried to take it out of my phone.  Next week, I did it again.

Fine, how about I just take it out of my phone case every night before I charge it?  That worked for about a week until I forgot to take it out and now it doesn't work again.

I've now purchased a new phone case to allow access to the card, and two new husky cards.  But there is an obvious solution, here.  Why can't the IMA just put the same kind of scanner for access instead of the swipey thing?  Can't they see they are causing me *immense* frustration?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/r7ma9z/husky_card_rant_keep_scrolling/,11,9

1. Identify images of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers and military equipment.
2. Collect images featured in Russian propaganda. 

The    individuals volunteering to sort images of soldiers and military    equipment will be provided an easy crash course by the verification team    lead (me). Here is an example of the material that will be covered in    the crash course: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo).

The    atrocities committed by Russian forces every day are testament to the    need for efficient and reliable real-time tracking of Russian troop    movements for the safety of Ukrainian civilians. Please help by  donating   some of your time. Even as little as a couple hours would be  helpful.

1bhjmj7,How hard is it to get into the College of Engineering after being a freshman?,"Hi everyone, I applied for CS which was a huge regret because later I realized that engineering was more my route. So I didn't get admitted to CS but instead got in as a pre-science major. So now I have to apply for the College of Engineering. I want to do CE but since it's super competitive I decided I wanted to do electrical engineering. I got pretty much all my prereqs done besides 2 Java classes before I could apply for the College of Engineering. I'm NOT trying to apply to the Paul Allen School but just to UW College of Engineering and then apply for ECE. My brother and his friend think I have a good chance of getting in since I got a lot of my prereqs done but I'm a bit iffy since I only have a 3.7 GPA in the running start and it might drop more.
