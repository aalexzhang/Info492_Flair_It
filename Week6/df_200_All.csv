"everything sucks things are not good!!! taking 18 credits is not fun when you are stuck in a studio room toiling away doing school work!! i have no interest in doing my hobbies so when i'm not doing school work i just refresh reddit or my email over and over and over again.

it was okayish during the beginning of the quarantine but now im crying every other day. i feel so overwhelmed with the pandemic, remote learning, and graduating this quarter, my mental health is so bad. if i'm being honest i should not have taken classes last quarter or even this quarter but ""you only have a few more quarters to go! push through it!!"" i feel like nobody understands how much i'm suffering sometimes. trying to do homework when you're having suicidal thoughts is hard enough, but i want to get into grad school so i can't afford to complain.  i have to get those perfect grades no matter what! :-)

i know others definitely have it harder than me, but sometimes ranting can be so therapeutic. anyone else overwhelmed? or not? maybe you're really liking distance learning? i'm curious to know. i feel like i'm the only one struggling super hard during these weird times.

additionally, i am not currently having any suicidal thoughts, and i know how to cope and handle them. no need to worry. it's just an extra frustrated and sad kind of night.

edit: thank you guys so much for sharing your feelings. i don't have energy to reply individually to everyone but knowing that there are others that can relate really means a lot. i know people are under all sorts of pressure, school related or not, but don't forget to always prioritize your personal well being even if it means dropping a class, cancelling internships, and the like.",rant

"really could use some student input on if i should attend i'm currently a california senior trying to decide between here and university of wisconsin. initially, i was all on board with the idea of udub, but after looking into it, it seems like there's a toxic environment.

i'm admitted as dtc for engineering, so while i won't have to worry about getting into engineering, i still don't have a specific major. this is one of my biggest concerns. i keep hearing things about how competitive and cutthroat the students can be because everyone wants to get into their major. on top of that students apparently need to create an entire application, personal statement and all, just to apply for a major.

as for the social scene. i keep hearing that people are distant. something about a 'seattle freeze' and that it isn't really the easiest to meet a lot of people at school. additionally i hear that parties are few and far between if you're not in the greek system. does the school's reputation  as a commuter school really ring true?

overall i was just really hoping to hear some students' responses to some of these things. i really like the idea of being in seattle, having access to all these great companies in the area, and i love the idea of staying on the west coast. however, i don't want an atmosphere where people only have time to study and are constantly stressed.",discussion

"should i stay at uw (neuro) i'm currently a sophomore (soon to be junior) majoring in biology, and i recently got accepted to ucsd as a transfer majoring in neurobiology. i also plan to minor in applied math (have taken 301 and am planning on taking 3 more classes), and chemistry (if possible). currently i have a 3.5 overall gpa, with a 3.3 average across the bio series, so i think my chances at the neuroscience major are somewhat slim. however, i have had a year's worth of research experience in a neuroscience lab, and i've been involved in some neuroscience related clubs for quite a while (i'm also president of a non-neuro/bio rso). is it worth staying at uw, considering i probably won't get into the neuroscience major? how much does the major (biology vs. neuroscience) matter for graduate school (what i'm leaning towards) and/or medical school (something i'm considering but am not entirely sure of)? i'd like to do something with neuroscience in graduate school, so that might be important.   


currently the factors that are keeping me staying are: i have leadership positions at uw, uw has better/more neuroscience related clubs for undergrads, i have another lab lined up at uw that's very undergrad friendly/good for my transition into independent research, i can have minor(s) at uw, and uw might be better for my gpa because i can take less classes/have a less intense schedule.   


the factors encouraging me to transfer are: tuition (i'm a ca resident), weather, major (neurobiology vs biology), and the fact that ucsd is super good for neuro.  


considering everything, is it worth staying? what would you do, or if you've been in this situation, what did you do?

"ludicrous that i have to appeal a hold every quarter until i can apply to my major long story short, i majored in music theory at community college, got an aa, worked in the foodservice industry (an aa in music theory doesn't get you anywhere) and decided to go to uw with the intent to study chem.

i was pretty unaware of how majors worked here but heard it was a good school for stem. i applied as a transfer student because i had some credits that would transfer. however, most of my credits only transferred as uncategorized electives or vlpa, but i still technically have junior status, despite not having completed any of the first year stem core sequences. after my first quarter at uw, i apparently surpassed the threshold after which a registration hold is placed on your account unless you declare a major.

none of this was explained to us at the transfer a&o. i went into great detail in my personal statement how i wanted to pursue an education in physical science, specifically chemistry, but it was never mentioned to me that the prerequisites for even applying to the major take 5 consecutive quarters to complete. (chem 142, 152, 162, 237, 238, all of which are prerequisites in sequence.) fortunately, i had taken a gen chem class at community college that qualified as a 142 equivalent, but it remains a mathematical impossibility for me to complete the necessary requirements to declare a major within my first year here. it's an absolute farce that all but one of the disciplines within the school of natural sciences are capacity-constrained (the exception being microbiology, which still has minimum requirements that i could not have possibly met before the registration hold is placed on my account.)

as a result, my advisor told me to declare oceanography (an open major) because they would not continue to grant premajor extensions. however, i sent her the form and she failed to remove the hold before my priority registration time. 

i don't understand why they would encourage me to go here and then immediately penalize me for not abiding by a 100% impossible timetable. i'm taking 15 credits of weedouts a quarter, it's not like i'm dragging my feet.

aside: not to seem stubborn, but oceanography isn't a realistic fallback for someone who has never taken a biology class beyond survey of botany and can't swim. i came to seattle to study chemistry, not to save the whales (sorry whales)

aside 2: pre-sciences should not be allowed. the natural sciences department should be dtc only so people don't get shoehorned into some frivolous nonsense discipline that will leave them mired in student debt and only qualified for jobs that pay close to work they could get with no degree.",rant

fucking relax, y’all. 😂😂😂 we’re going hybrid this coming quarter, and most likely in-person in winter & spring. quote. me. on. that. 😎

see y’all in the fall.


/rant


edit: i think i have to re-iterate. i’m not asking that we go fully in-person in the fall, and nor am i asking that every sub-50 student class goes in-person. i’m asking that the current time schedule stands, and i think it’s very very likely since few classes are fully in-person. i have no idea if uw plans to add more classes to the in-person list before fall, and not sure if that’d be wise. it’s perfectly fine how it stands, no reason to go fully online every damn quarter until we have 0 cases.


edit 2: okay originally i was exaggerating about people saying online the full year but apparently people do want that?! get a fucking grip! 😂😂😂

edit 3: can y'all imagine a full year of online? like, just thinking about it..i would probably end up with some major depression. i'd definitely postpone graduation to '22, that's for sure!

"zoom must die *tl;dr: zoom is a product that wasn’t designed with you — the user — in mind: it has numerous security flaws, is blatantly evil and more than happy to give your data to the government (and china), and is poorly if at all engineered. stop using zoom. if you can, please help me* [*write uw officials*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jxee09i8ncgxm4ihiy66cxy8d4qiif3dhj4ogjaa6i/edit) *to get us off of zoom.*

i hate zoom. i’m just going to put it out there, so take everything i say with a grain of salt. it’s biased, and mostly an angry rant. before getting into valid reasons for why you should avoid zoom like the plague (not that we’re doing a good job of that right now 😉), let me first go through a subjective assessment of the product.

to me, zoom feels like something designed for enterprise it people that just sucks up your money: it’s bloated with configuration options everywhere, you have to adapt to the product’s workflow instead of the other way around, it doesn’t respect you, on and on.

first off, why do i need to install a desktop app? it’s 2020 people, we’ve figured out how to do video on the web. and here’s the real kicker: zoom *does* actually have a web interface, but it *purposefully* sucks to encourage you to use their desktop clients. if you click a zoom link and don’t have the desktop app installed, the app will start auto-downloading and a dialog will pop up asking you to open the app. not only is auto-downloading their crap invasive, but i didn’t ask for that. i just want to join a meeting, not use your software. why are you getting in my way? then, if you cancel the download and browser pop-up, you can click to try again which will open another pop-up. only after cancelling that second pop-up will a teeny-tiny option appear at the bottom of the page to “join from your browser.” you can see what i’m talking about [here](https://assets.zoom.us/images/en-us/web/misc/launching-page.png). now that’s just evil. your product should be about the customer and making people’s lives easier, not your stupid growth goals.

next, why is the user interface so terrible? the desktop app doesn’t even scale to my 4k screen (first world problems, i know, sorry) so that means i have to squint just to read anything. i’m not going to bother elaborating further since this is subjective, but in general, zoom looks gross to me.

more importantly, let’s talk about user experience for a second, or rather how zoom doesn’t give a shit about you. if you’ve tried using the desktop app, i’m sure you’ve been annoyed at how the zoom app will randomly maximize and take over your screen. or how you can’t actually close it, the app just collapses instead. or how the comments are a separate window that you have to keep track of. and i haven’t been a zoom host before, but several of my professors complained about how sharing their screen makes the rest of zoom disappear so they can’t see the comments or other people. and how stupid can zoom be to force call “hosts?” why can’t i join the call early and chit-chat with people beforehand? in general call hosts are a retarded idea only needed for billing ([you pay per host](https://zoom.us/pricing)). and don’t even get me started on the streaming quality. i can’t think of a single call that didn’t have audio artifacts and glitches. again, how stupid can you be? audio is *the* most important part of a call. sure, video is great but if i can’t hear what someone is saying then what’s the point? zoom seems to prioritize the video stream, or based on my low opinion of them, they don’t prioritize anything and just hope it works out.

collecting a few unrelated terrible experiences, why can’t someone who joined the call see the comment history? i dunno about you, but the same links ended up getting posted like five times throughout the lecture because anytime you go to a breakout room, all the previous history is lost. and breakout rooms, ugh. why can’t i see the original stream at the same time as my breakout room? now i’ve lost all context of the presentation and why we’re in this thing in the first place. and then i’m treated like a child and kicked out of the room while in the middle of an interesting/fun conversation because the timer ran out. (\*insert spider-man pointing meme about how poster sounds like a whiny baby\*)

now for the objective reasons we must stop using zoom: let’s talk about security. zoom has no idea what they’re doing and will blatantly lie to you. i started re-googling security flaws for this post and literally *this morning*, [another zero-day came out](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/zoom-security-flaw-windows). zoom is happy to [delete free-speech because china wants them to](https://www.wired.com/story/zoom-china-facebook-fbi-security-news/) and claim they are an american company but [it's developed in china](https://technode.com/2020/04/13/is-zoom-crazy-to-count-on-chinese-rd/). until people complained, they were only going to [give encryption to paying customers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294355/zoom-security-end-to-end-encryptoin-beta-release-july-2020-new-feature) so that they could [sell your data to the police/government](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/3/21279285/zoom-fbi-encryption-calls-free-users). and this was in june! how heartless and tone-deaf do you have to be? and their [encryption is a lie anyway](https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=28812%5c) or maybe they’re just so stupid they don’t understand cryptography. their website is also [full of vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/zoom-us-vulnerability-could-trigger-xss). they [lie about how many users they have](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement), they [sell your data to advertisers](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/zoom-privacy-issues), their desktop app [steals your password](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/zoom-bug-can-let-hackers-steal-your-windows-password/article31233645.ece#:~:text=users%20windows%20password.-,the%20'zoom%20client%20for%20windows'%20is%20vulnerable%20to%20the%20',matthew%20hickey%20and%20mohamed%20a.), i could go on. here’s a [much more educated write-up](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/) than my rant on their shitty security if you’re interested.

*the point: uw is mostly going to have online classes again despite claims of being “hybrid.”* ***your tuition money is paying for zoom.*** *make it stop.*

so what do we use instead? i’m biased, but i think we should be using google meet. breakout rooms are the only real missing piece (though i would argue we don’t need them anyway), but [those features will be coming](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/26/google-announces-a-bunch-of-features-to-bring-meet-on-par-with-zoom/) at the start of the school year.=

if you'd like to help me kill zoom, i'm planning on writing uw administrators and professors to try and sway them away from zoom. please leave some feedback on [my draft for the email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jxee09i8ncgxm4ihiy66cxy8d4qiif3dhj4ogjaa6i/edit).",rant

"tell me my college life isn’t ruined long rant ahead; 

i was sad when my freshmen year was cut in half. but whatever, it’ll be over in a few weeks, we’ll be back in spring. <nope> well, at least, we will be back for fall <nope>. 

it took me some time to accept that fact i’ll not have a sophomore year. don’t believe me? what’s the earliest we could have a vaccine. probably the end of the year, but that’s just 100 million doses, less than 1/3rd of the population of us. (check references below). no one wants to go back to normal unless virtually everyone is vaccinated. that will at least take the entire winter 2021 quarter to happen. so two quarters are gone already. now, i can’t say people are *willing* to go back anyway. will life be normal with a vaccine? i don’t have an answer and i don’t think anyone else does. that’s why i’m put my estimate for having a “regular college” experience around fall 2021. 

i had planned to graduate in 3-3.5 years. but that’ll leave me with just one year to have the “most memorable moments of my life”. you know, the time when you’re supposed to make lifelong friends.. 

that gets me to my second topic, friends. 6 months weren’t enough to get to know people and make good friends, for me at least. ik someone is gonna mention rso in the comments. guess what, i tried that. one of them is an engineering rso where we hardly talked about stuff apart from work. i have joined other rsos to meet people. i was like the only freshmen in them. i always felt welcomed but never “part of a group” since everyone knew each other and i kind of felt like an outsider at times. i also wanted to unite uw. i waited for spring thinking the weather would be nice to explore seattle (stupidest decision i have made at uw). 

i am not saying i haven’t made friends. i have made some good friends. if you can spot me from the username, you’re one of them. and i know that i can trust you guys to pick up the call if i were to call you. trust me, you guys are the reason i haven’t gone insane yet. my issue is that the short amount of time we had on campus was not enough to make a good friendship considering i met most of you in winter. naturally, i have grown a little farther from my hs friends since i haven’t seen them for like a year. with the combined effect of these two things, i fell like i’m drifting apart from people in general. i feel like i’m getting lonelier everyday…

i didn’t have this problem until recently. i don’t know when and if things will go back to normal. i used to be optimistic: “this thing i’m doing rn will help me later on”. but, the future is blurry and i don’t see a light at the end of this dark tunnel. no matter how much i hate it, i have to accept that my sophomore year is gone, and that’ll have some irreparable damages. my social life won’t be as exciting as i imagined. i feel like my college life is now ruined and i can’t do anything about it. fortunately, my academics haven’t taken a hit because of this, but other things have. i haven’t picked up my guitar or watched a movie for like weeks now. call it an irrational fear but i feel like if  i start to do anything i like rn, i will begin hating it. ik sounds irrational. 

i know there are people who have suffered more than me because of this pandemic, and, my intention is not to overshadow them with this rant. nor am i making a case for any reform and change. i just thought it would help to write this rant.

i get it's not that big of a deal overall as most people will just typically wait until class starts to see what the professor says, but it wouldn't hurt them to clarify things a bit.",rant

"likelihood of uw closing dorms... i’ve been seeing a lot of comments around this sub lately about how “hfs is definitely gonna send students back home a week after classes start” or “dorms are not gonna last until december” and such, and so i wanted to make this post as a sort of discussion for that topic.


personally speaking, i don’t see a scenario where hfs has to close. there’s no argument that spring was the height of the pandemic for washington, and the surge of cases that came with july 4th has mellowed out and we’re back at a ~2% positivity rate with tests in king county. so, as it stands, we are doing better than spring and yet dorms remained open during that time.


also, i believe it was u/uw_hfs (could’ve been someone else) who commented here before detailing how hfs has learned a lot from the spring experience and will be taking care of things even better (regarding disinfection and whatnot), so assuming cases only get as bad as they were at the height of the pandemic so far, hfs will be better-equipped.


most of the colleges that have closed dorms are at high-risk areas. some haven’t even closed at all and are handling it in a different way, like in tennessee. a college over there decided to evacuate a single residence hall and just use it for students who need to self-isolate. well, hfs already has that with hansee i believe, which shows their level of preparation, and has unused buildings like mcmahon and haggett that could be used for that if it ever came down to that.


i might be underestimating the potential surge in cases that can come with students returning to campus, but i’m sure you guys already know that greek houses were active all summer and many more greek students returned a couple weeks ago and this week. and still, cases trend down significantly. of course, things change when you throw oos students into the mix and those from eastern wa, but i think a poll on here (not super representative, i know) showed that many oos students are not flying out here and on-campus residents are primarily in-state (makes sense).


i guess i’m biased because i plan on staying on-campus, but this whole “hfs gonna close down right away, we’re fucked” thing is a huge assumption that is based off the experiences of schools in hotspots (aka, conservative states). hfs has re-iterated over and over that they are well-equipped to handle whatever is coming, and worst-case they’ll put residence halls into quarantine mode like some other colleges have done. but i don’t even think that’ll happen.


in order for hfs to consider closing, i think the daily cases have to get significantly worse than the july 4th height. that was 900-1000 daily cases for washington, and like ~300 for king county (someone correct me if i’m wrong). now, it’s up to you to decide: are we gonna go from 200-300 cases a day (now) to 900-1000 cases a day in october just from uw dorms reopening? and can it get worse than that? 


anything can happen, so i hope it doesn’t come to hfs closing down, but it doesn’t hurt to be a bit more optimistic. dorms were never the best places to party anyway (mcmahon was the only place where it can be pulled off and that building is closed lmao)


the way the ima is operating right now shows how seriously uw takes the coronavirus i think. my friends claim the ima is “shitty” right now because you can’t even spot someone benching and there’s like only 3 spots to workout in the dumbbell area due to heavy (and necessary) social distancing. sucks, but it says a lot about how much caution is being taken at the uw. have faith!

"could my mother's remarriage force me to drop out? [osfa] title probably seems extreme. let me explain:

my mother grew up in an extremely conservative culture where it was not culturally acceptable for women to pursue a career or education. my father passed away many years ago and i have lived most of my life on government programs. my efc has always been 0. well, my mother is now planning on getting remarried. my possible-step-dad has multiple kids of his own and won't be moving in with my mother right after they get married due to our house's small size. he will not be financially contributing to my family for some time. they are going to wait longer to buy a house or some other living arrangement. my mother may get married as soon as this month. here's the problem: i am completely dependent on financial aid to attend school, but my mother's fiance has enough money that, when he marries my mother, i won't qualify for any financial aid. my living situation and financial resources will be completely unchanged. in fact, we will qualify for less governmental assistance, so it will actually get worse. my mother was terminated from her job because of the pandemic as well.

uw's financial aid agreement states the following:

 i understand that this award is based on information i have provided about my financial status. i agree to report to the office of student financial aid any changes in my financial situation, including, but not limited to changes in marital status. i understand that these changes or corrections may result in a reduction of awards and/or require repayment of aid already received.

  
should i just...not report the remarriage? will this jeopardize my ability to receive aid in future years? what happens when, in 2022, i have to include tax returns from this year, which prove that i didn't report a change in marital status as soon as possible? this feels excessively punishing.",rant

review the university of washington 2020-2021 academic calendar, paying careful attention to the adding/dropping courses or complete withdrawal section. carefully review these instructions, deadlines, and links. 

note: beginning october 7th, 2020, there will be a $20.00 change of registration fee associated with any kind of changes to your registration for autumn quarter, with a maximum of $20.00 charged per day. 

new - current quarter drop

learn more about the current quarter drop process which replaced the annual drop.

beginning october 14, 2020 (start of the third week) through november 17th (end of the seventh week), you can use the current quarter self-service drop in registration via myuw to drop one course per quarter yourself. this replaces the former annual drop process which only allowed for one course drop per academic year. if you need to drop more than one course or to process a complete withdrawal from all of your classes before the end of the 7th week, you will use the current quarter adviser-assisted drop. this includes a conversation with your adviser, before your request moves on to your campus registration team.

full withdrawal after seventh week

following the 7th week (november 17, 2020), email your campus registrar team from your uw.edu email address to notify them that you wish to make a full withdrawal from all of your classes. see email addresses below.


registrar drop (rd) - new transcript notation

the new rd (registrar drop) transcript annotation replaces the former w, w3-w7, and hw (hardship withdrawal), beginning spring 2020.

new - former quarter drop process

learn more about the former quarter drop process which replaced the former hardship withdrawal petition process.



extraordinary circumstances quarter late grading change option

autumn 2020 has been designated an extraordinary circumstances quarter. this means that in addition to changing grading options for your courses from s/ns to numeric or numeric to s/ns up to the 7th week of the quarter, you may also request a late grading option change beginning december 23, 2020, after the instructor grade submission deadline. 

you may continue to make changes to your course grading options of numeric or s/ns using myuw through the end of the 7th week (november 17, 2020) and note that the $20.00 change of registration fee applies each time you request a change to your registration.

religious accommodation policy and request process

learn more about the religious accommodations policy. it is the policy of the university of washington to reasonably accommodate students’ religious observances in accordance with rcw 28b.137.010.

the deadline to submit this request for autumn quarter 2020 is friday, october 9 at 5 p.m.

"[remote proctoring] protect your privacy, folks. hello!  

i hope remote learning is treating you fairly and that you are well in whatever location covid has stranded you.

one of my professors is requiring students to download the proctoru add-on for exams and other exercises. i was unfamiliar with it until recently (this is the first i have heard of it), but after researching it and reading what permissions it has, i can't help but feel like this is a massive violation of privacy. distrotube did [a feature on it](https://youtu.be/xrm1lxfn3vw), and i am honestly appalled. distro can be pretty intense, but his analysis is on-point. the letter he mentions from western sydney university can be found [here](http://cucfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/proctoru_2020-1.pdf).

from what i have found, not only does it collect sensitive personal information, proctoru (and like-minded services) can access your search history, processes, and system information. proctoru's [privacy policy](https://www.proctoru.com/privacy-policy) has been cleaned up or updated since distro made his video; a bold statement saying they would never sell your information is stapled to the top of the page. proctoru's privacy policy does (see: ""third party sharing"") clearly state that they have no qualms about transferring a student's information to third parties. so they will not sell your information, but they will hand it over if they are acquired or a similar situation arises, which is *almost* identical. also troubling to me is that the company records your audio and video, keeping it on record for ""as long as necessary"" (see: ""data retention""). 

i cannot imagine this sits well with many people, but perhaps i wear a thicker tinfoil hat than others. in a day and age where technology advances at breakneck speed and selling user information is a highly lucrative and common business, i cannot believe that this software is being used or even legal. has this issue been raised to the uw? is there a place *to* raise this issue? my greatest fear is reaching out to faculty about my skepticism, and having my professor fail me purely out of spite.

i'm frustrated and quite frankly think it's bullshit that the lsj department supposedly promotes social justice and equality and yet throws their low-income students under the bus with this requirement... >:/ heaven knows there are students trying to complete this requirement that are a lot worse off than me!

any advice/paid internship postings would be greatly appreciated, lol.",rant

i'm not liking physics at all this quarter mostly because every bit of it is asynchronous and i feel so disconnected from the class. isn't there some way to just arrange a zoom meeting at least once a week for the whole class to discuss doubts and concept questions like prof su does for math 126 (a class i love so far btw)? like you don't have to attend it every week but it gives a sort of classroom environment. the discussion board thing just does not feel the same.",rant

"chances of being admitted to the school of foster i know for a fact that uw school of foster ba program is very competitive to get admitted in, but what i would like to know is what are my chances of getting in.


a little background. i am currently at a community college planning to transfer to uw for fall 2021. my grades currently average out to about a 3.7 gpa. by the time i finish my current quarter (fall 2020) it should average out to a 3.5 gpa ( two of my classes i did very well but in one of them i did not. 4.0, 3.4 and possibly a 3.0 or 2.9? depending how i do on my final). i believe my gpa is in good standing. not to give out to much details, i also have an extensive amount of leadership experience, community building, volunteering, extracurricular activities, and overall, very involved with my school. i think this should also help me with my chances of getting in. 

as a side note, i went to a technical college to be trained in a specific field but the field isn't related to business. it is a college and you're also graded so i'm thinking when i apply that they would also want to see this? they asked for all colleges attended. my grades from this place aren't great, quite literally, they were on the edge of passing/failing. d's across the board with a few c's. this was during my much younger days where i didn't really care what my grades were as long as i passed. 


so, my questions are these:
- if i happen to have an average gpa by the time i apply ( let's say 3.3) but an extensive amount of leadership, extracurricular activities, etc. do you think my chances of being admitted are still good?

- in terms of writing my personal statement to foster ( separate from general uw admissions) how do i explain my poor grades from my technical college with out saying ""yeah, my grades there were bad but that was younger me""? this one im really concerned about if they factor it in and question why its so low.

- any tips in better preparing to transfer? 

feel free to ask questions if you want to know something more specific. thank you for any contribution!

"so, fall quarter is over... (i needed to process this out somewhere, feel free to not read past this... or, mods, delete this if this isn't the place.)

...and i don't feel great about it. i usually have a fulfilling and cathartic release of stress around this time of each break. we all have bad days, but i'm struggling to figure out how this 12-week-long period got this particularly bad for me inside and outside of academics.

i think it starts with my living situation. i'm pretty extroverted, and i draw a lot of my energy and motivation from being around other people. covid has obviously prevented me from hanging out with a lot of my closest friends, especially so since my parents have health issues. however, i was lucky enough to snag a studio off 45th in the u district for the academic year. i was chiefly hoping that despite my extroverted nature, i could pick up where i left off in living on my own and learn how to be truly self-sufficient and have fun on my own. a few in-state and oos friends of mine also moved here for the year, so i was hoping to also see a few friends from time to time without endangering my parents and get fresh air between my classes. however, i've only felt lonelier than i ever have in my life. i'm the kind of person who can get lonely surrounded by a crowd of people, so living alone has felt really isolating. it doesn't help that most of my friends here haven't really made an effort to keep in touch much. maybe they're busy? wouldn't explain why they're holding parties in their apartments. (maybe i dodged a bullet.) basically everyone i know has roommates and it's unsafe for them to see people outside their household, too, for obvious reasons. regardless, i tried taking matters in my own hands and forgetting about matters i couldn't control. (i also tried using bumble for a week but it ultimately hurt my mental health even more before i got rid of it.) it also doesn't help that the sun sets so early here nowadays and we get barely any breaks in the clouds.

i also feel like my academic workload has added to this. to me, it feels like a majority of stem profs don't know what their students are going through in the pandemic, while others just don't give a shit. how am i supposed to perform at my pre-covid levels when nothing about our lives has fundamentally changed between march and now? when i'm constantly and consistently stressing out about recruiting, paying rent, my family, potus's bs, my duties as an rso officer *and* trying to get good grades, i find it hard to focus on surface integrals or, better yet, self-care—getting enough sleep, exercising, going on walks, meditating, everything i've heard uw and department admin repeatedly stress that students should do to feel better. maybe it's my fault for entering two challenging programs and for taking three stem and one honors class this quarter (and next... and spring '21) to graduate from them on time, and i sure didn't go to college for a free throw. i missed quite a few deadlines this quarter (not normal for me) and i barely made it across the finish line during finals week. i kept leaving things until the last moment just because i felt like i couldn't control my stress like i used to since i'm just... tired.

what did both of these factors combine into? i've had negative feelings and thoughts, and since i have been so isolated in my studio and not been able to get out much due to my schoolwork and weather being so terrible, i've had 24 hours every day to sit in my thoughts and let them stew into worse versions of themselves. my anxiety's high (to where, multiple times this quarter, i've gotten physically sick, started breathing worse, thought i had covid, and thankfully tested negative) and my self esteem is low. i fell into a vicious cycle of getting stressed about work, getting more stressed about loneliness, not doing work, and then getting more stressed about work. i'm having trouble having conversations with people i usually conversed with freely and i get anxious in public. i'm especially getting jealous when i do get outside, end up on the ave, and see people walking in groups and enjoying themselves, something i haven't recalled ever feeling jealous of. i haven't seriously considered jumping off the roof of my building or diving into traffic on roosevelt because i know i have things to look forward to in my future (seeing friends that i still haven't seen since covid since hit washington state... starting a career, raising a family, becoming the best version of myself). however, every day this quarter, i haven't felt like i'm truly learning and enjoying the experience i'm getting from my tuition money, but i have felt like i'm just going through the motions and... surviving instead of living. i can't help but feel dejected and tired from having to hang on for so long. i'm going from making dean's list after a tough schedule of three weed-out classes last spring to probably s/ns-ing a major requirement. moreover, i feel myself slipping from my normally kind, ambitious, and charismatic self to a hateful, despondent, jealous person that i hoped i would never be. i'm tired of feeling like i'm not understood or supported in any way in my life, and i'm tired of constantly having to play catch-up with my work. at the same time, it feels like i'm at war with myself and i'm not even close to winning.

...so, who else feels like they've been reduced to a shell of their former selves this quarter, and doesn't know where to start on rebuilding themselves? 😅

"can i get into uw postbac for bio? # i am a french major with 3.74 gpa and 204 credits looking to apply to uw bio as a postbac. 

**positives**:

* my overall gpa is 3.74, my major gpa (french) is 3.91, and my bio/chem prereqs gpa (likely the most important factor) is 3.08 (disgusting, i know. i didn't have a chem/bio background so i got nuked in the intro classes.) i'm also a member of phi betta kappa honors society.
* in terms of progress, i completed bio 180, 200, and 220, and chem 145 and 152. i also finished math 124. 
* my current winter registration is for bio 361: genomics, bio 354 and chem 162.  
* i am also aware that statements of purpose are a huge deciding factor regarding acceptance.  i would describe my writing as decently competent, though i am mostly insecure because of my bio/chem gpa and high credit number. 

**negatives**:

* i don't have any research and my last two lab classes were online so i don't have much lab experience. 

# my questions are: 

1) do i have a decent chance of getting in,  or should i just assume the worst?  

2) if my credentials do not look that bad, should i focus on graduating asap with the highest gpa possible, or should i try and finish more upper division bio classes? 

3) will having completed more biology classes (i.e. a higher percentage of the bio degree) undergrad make me more favorable as a postbac applicant? 

# my backup plans:

**1) transfer to a community college and try to complete a bio degree there/reapply to uw as postbac after finishing more bio degree requirements**

if my chances of getting into bio are pretty negligible, then it may be wiser to graduate immediately instead of trying to take bio 361 and 354, in order to take advantage of my gpa as it currently is. 

the downside to this method is that, to my knowledge, while prereqs like physics and ochem are offered at community college, upper class division bio is not (though i could be wrong about this assumption).  

**2) finish bio requirements at a community college and try to take upper division bio classes at uw**

there is the alternative of trying to take them as a non-degree student, but i do not think taking the upper division bio classes as a non-matriculated student is possible as they have a very low dropout rate (i say this as someone who just barely managed to register for them and had some difficulty).  also, while i have been considering the premed pathway, i really want a degree more than to just finish the prereqs because i am aware of the high rejection rate of med school applicants and i do not feel secure just banking my luck on a low possibility. 

overall, i just want to focus on obtaining a bio degree (preferably in physiology).  i have filed some transfer applications to other universities (and am considering community college for basic required classes), and i've been recommended to look into grad school and master's programs, but if possible i would like to apply for postbac. 

**3) desperately try to get more research/lab experience, study for the bio gre, and apply to uw bio grad school**

i don't feel super lucky with this option because i'm a french major instead of a bio undergrad.

**4) apply for a bio master's degree**

see above. also lack of research/lab fieldwork. 

**5) do a complete 180 and take the lsat and apply to law school.**

you might ask: um, so do you like law? and the answer is...uhhh...i mean, i liked legally blonde well enough, i guess. this option is a sort of a desperate shot in the dark, a desperate man's last cry for help.  this option also would probably require me to drop all my current classes in order to keep my gpa as high as it currently is. 

**6) apply for the uw bsn**

i haven't looked totally into this option, so i don't even know if i can be admitted or if they are going to reject me due to credit limit regardless of my gpa like the bio department. chances are, i might not even be able to be admitted due to my 204 credits.

interested in music? interested in law? consider taking law p 536, music law & policy, in spring quarter 2021. this innovative, interdisciplinary 3-credit course, which meets synchronously on zoom on mondays and wednesdays from 1:30pm-2:50pm, will focus primarily on u.s. copyright law as it relates to musical compositions and sound recordings, with some attention paid to the ways in which trademark law and the right of personality are relevant to music and musicians. before delving into the nuances of intellectual property law as it relates to music, the course will provide students with an overview of what, exactly, it means to *be* music, with students receiving a crash course in the basics of music theory sufficient to understand musical terminology as it arises in legal disputes. students will then learn about existing music law precedents and current legal controversies not only by reading doctrine and case law, but also by examining the musical scores and listening to the musical sound recordings at issue in those cases. no prior knowledge of music theory or intellectual property law is required as the course will teach both of those subjects from the ground up.

non-law students interested in taking the course can contact the professor directly at pnicolas \[at uw dot edu\] for questions about the course or for assistance in obtaining an add code. although law students are the primary audience, it is open to students in any department. sln for non-law students is 21506.",academics

"random rant about my first tutoring experience in the owrc. the appointment was a waste of time, the tutor kept emphasize that i need to do more research and continuously insist the fact that she can’t help me b/c she knows nothing about the prompt (i would think that it is common for tutors to get an unfamiliar prompt?), can’t answer my research questions (told me straight off that i should ask a librarian for research help), and can’t answer my argumentative essays questions (again tell me straight of that i should ask my professor instead of her and she can’t help me). didn't even try to make an effort to help before saying no. 

i felt being turned down/rejected more than once by her and she doesn’t care, as if she just wants to get things over with soon and finished. we met for less than 20mins and i was feeling being pushed to leave because she can only help me with peer review but i don’t have a draft for her. 

it only adds to my stress and anxiety with soo much academic workload that i need to complete. being told repeatedly that i need to do more diligence research when i tried my best to get started on research and taking notes so i can at least have something before seeing the tutor and was hoping they can help me get started on my paper outline, thesis statement, or help with research. 

i was honestly trying my best to get everything together on time after having a heavily weighted research report that requires an insane amount of workload, two-class presentation, an exam, and other assignments and studies, and little sleep to get through the day so i can get everything finished on schedule, yet i was being told that i didn't do diligent research. 

sure i get it, but wasn't it the point of help-seeking? tutors are there to help not just with essay peer reviews, but with struggling students as well? or helping students to get started on their paper? 

i don't know how most students start their essays, but i am the type that has a hard time starting and often took more time drafting an essay from scratch. i am the kind of student that always tries to seek writing help and appreciates any feedback that i received, i can feel it if people are truly trying to help or if they don't care at all.

"registration 101 tips and tricks many of you may already know this but i also know that a whole bunch of you dont.

someone told me about this registration method fall quarter of my sophomore year and i have always gotten all my classes since then on the first try (given that they had spaces open during my registration period). 

step 1: compile your classes and make sure that you meet all the requirements and what not. also make sure it is not full by the time u get to register. (good time to pull up the world clock as well that will show you the exact time with seconds)

step 2: pin that perfect schedule on myplan. it should now show up on the upper right corner under “pinned schedules” for you to adore. 

step 3: click the view/register button at about 5:55 or whenever you feel like it just make sure its a little bit before 6 am on your designated registration date. 

step 4: click next at the bottom right corner and then also click register. (it should take you to the sln registration page and return an error message saying that your registration window has not opened. keep this open and stay on the page)

step 5: look at the world clock and wait until it gets to the sweet spot (around 5:59.35ish). 

step 6: click the refresh button on your browser. (the sln page with the error message. the webpage still has all ur classes you put in from step 4). you may get the same error message a couple times but just keep refreshing. 

step 7: at a certain point the refresh will seem like its taking a bit longer. this is the key to stop refreshing and wait. within a couple of seconds you should have gotten into your classes. 

note* this has always worked for me and has gotten me into classes that only had <5 spaces left. it may not work all the time but it sure does give you a better chance at getting in than the people still registering at exactly 6am. 

also good idea to have open a another page with ur backups in case this fails.",psa

"""dependent student verification"" is it just me? so i've been contacted by ofsa about needing to ""verify"" that i'm a dependent student so i end up having to do dig around my house/former jobs for papers and fill out more paperwork or risk not having my financial aid for next or future quarters in general.

now this wouldn't really bother me too much, but so far, at the 3 years i've been here every single time i fill out my fafsa they contact me about being ""selected for verification"" why?

nobody else i know has ever had to do this once. not even my brother. it's ridiculous. it's so stupid because for the past 2-3 years, i've spent days having to do all this bs to prove i'm a dependent... like do you not believe me or something? i've sent you proof so many times.

am i tripping off the system or something? do they choose who needs to be verified? i feel like i'm being targeted and i don't know why. 

i apologize if i sound like a whiny baby but it is honestly so fucking infurating that for the past three years i've had to take extra days and jump through hoops to find my parents and my financial information while as far as i can tell, everyone else is chilling after they fill out their fafsa and don't have to worry about anything else. 

i'll send a similar message to financial aid telling them to fuck off but in a nicer way and i haven't gotten a response. any ideas?",rant

* high-risk workers in health care settings
* high-risk first responders
* residents and staff of assisted living facilities
* all other workers in health care settings
* all people 65 years and older
* people 50 years and older in multigenerational households
* workers in child care settings
* pre-kindergarten through 12th-grade educators and staff

the vast majority of all these groups who choose to will have *at least one-dose* by march 29th, the first day of the spring quarter at uw.

this was an *unknown* virus on january 21, 2020, when the first american case was reported and the extreme measures we had taken via lockdown were correct for their intention. this is a *known* virus today in 2021, 410 days later. we know that [80% of the deaths have been from adults 65+](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html). that has been our serious concern to flatten the curve, and we have. to limit the loss of life. those who face a serious outcome are now protected to the extent the medical community can.

[0.06%](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/07/13/covid-risk) of the deaths due to covid in america have been 18-39 year-olds. comparatively, 1.8% of the [2018-2019 flu deaths](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127799/influenza-us-mortality-rate-by-age-group/) were 18-49 year-olds.

the real threat of covid is over. healthcare workers and our elders are (for the most part) protected and increasingly so.

it will probably be a horrible right of passage this year, getting covid. for young adults 18-39, the symptoms are the same as the rest of the age groups but we recover faster and don't go to the icu at nearly the same rate as the aged population.

we should be able to wear masks to class as we do at the store and other essential businesses. the remote learning model is not holistically sustaining students. we have passed the main threat of this pandemic physically. now can we address the deep learning and emotional needs of the citizens of washington and students of uw?",discussion

"hcde: graduate school? hi everyone,

i wanted to post this question because i feel that i get many mixed responses regarding graduate school for people going into the ux field. as an undergrad in the hcde program, i was considering applying for the department's masters program, but i'm worried about the prospect of paying off student loans that i feel will accumulate too much over time (note: im a oos student). 

a lot of people i've talked to say that graduate school is unnecessary, particularly in the ux field, and developing a strong portfolio is much preferred. however, my question is that wouldn't going to graduate school strengthen your overall portfolio and resume? additionally, when searching for careers, it seems many of the positions seek for people with more work experience and preferably a degree higher than that of a bs. i feel that i would stand no chance compared to much more experienced candidates with refined portfolios when it comes to the competition for jobs. 

it also seems that much of the ""prestige"" of the hcde dept. lies in their master's programs as i can't seem to find too much information regarding the bachelor's program. maybe i'm wrong. but, i just feel really lost about this subject because i've really yet to figure out my career track, let alone figure out if graduate school is something i should consider. i'm panicking because i'm going to be a junior soon, and i have no idea what i want to do with my degree or have even started a solid portfolio. 

for hcde people, how difficult was it to find a job, particularly with a bs degree? is graduate school worth the financial investment? for those going into hcde ms program, why did you choose to do so? what differences are there in bs and ms programs for hcde? do you have any advice on how to get started on your portfolio early?

in general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do not stutter (as well as children who stutter and children who do not stutter!) for a variety of experiments in which **you'll be compensated $15/hr**. we can **reimburse for street parking** and we will provide you with a **free hearing screening** as part of the experiment. children's experiments involve a free **speech and language evaluation** by a clinician as well as a small toy for your child.

due to the current public health crisis, we are only recruiting for specific adult studies right now. these studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words off a screen. we have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of covid-19. 

if you are interested, or have any questions at all, please email us at [maxlab@uw.edu](mailto:maxlab@uw.edu)!

however, i read here: [https://admit.washington.edu/apply/transfer/policies/](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/transfer/policies/)  that ""students will be required to complete foreign language study at the 103-level or to demonstrate language proficiency at the 103-level through an examination."".

i'm pretty close to getting my transfer degree and i'm wondering if there's any other way to go about this besides staying behind to take chinese 102 and 103?

i took japanese for 4 years in high school and got all a's. i took ib japanese for 2 years and got a 5 on the sl exam (ab). i'm not sure if this would help me get out of this situation?

any help or resources would be helpful! thanks.",admissions

also, at what grades for prerequisites and extracurriculars would it be most plausible to get admission into both udub and a capacity-constrained major such as informatics and hcde by transferring?

if it helps to answer, base it on the premise of a student attending washington state community college for 2-years with 90 transferrable credits.

"[opinionated overview] the whole beef between the asuw and the daily is so incredibly messed up and it makes me so angry. **update:** i have posted a follow-up thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1e3kz/a_followup_on_my_opinionated_overview_and_how_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that includes detailed instructions on submitting complaints and a petition to resolve problems surrounding the sending of the email.

[the cartoon in question](https://preview.redd.it/yvd4q5t2ozv61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90dfd1f3c40f2ead992a6a457b65913ace3b830)

so i, like many of you received an email from asuw (from which i am not subscribed to any newsletter) about racist imagery targeting certain uw students. my first thought was that it was probably some right-wing cartoonist who posted a problematic opinion piece that crossed the line, but i couldn't find it because it seemed to have already been removed. you can see it above here. the general consensus amongst students who have problems with this is essentially that this cartoon compares the majority bipoc candidates to animals (along with a food truck and public art piece).

before i move on and explain why i don't think this is a comparison or racist at all, let me give you the context for the cartoon that the mass-sent email left out. the daily is a student-run newspaper that always posts their candidate endorsements for the asuw elections, which is uw's student government. this year however, likely due to covid-19 and people not being as involved and on-campus, the tickets for the major races stand completely uncontested with one unofficial opposition ticket. the daily this year decided to not endorse any of the candidates, specifically stating that ""this year, the daily has decided not to endorse any of the candidates,  all of whom are qualified for their respective positions but, based on  their performance, are clearly not prepared."" i *highly* encourage you to read the full endorsement article, which can found [here](https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html). you will find that while the writers have both positive and negative opinions on each candidate, they still choose not to endorse any.

now here is where the cartoon comes in: since all of the elections are uncontested, the article pokes fun at this fact by suggesting write-in candidates consisting of iconic uw imagery. any student who has been on campus and many who have not had the chance will be able to recognize these ""candidates"" as staples of the uw's campus culture and jokes pertaining to them have been common for as long as they have existed. now, the medicinal herb garden monkey seems to be the animal people are most upset about, and it does not help that it is one of the more niche uw icons. if you are unaware of the monkey, you can read about it's history and see pictures of it [here](https://magazine.washington.edu/monkey-business-the-story-of-the-uw-medicinal-herb-garden-and-its-guardians). considering all of this information and context, i am hard-pressing in seeing the angle that many critics are presenting that the candidates are being ""compared"" in any way to these animals which only make up a portion of the suggestions.

ultimately, the daily removed this cartoon from their publication and issued an open-letter apology to the asuw. if this is where the controversy ended, i would move on and not make this post but i am sure most of you reading this are aware of the email that was just sent to all uw students from the asuw.

today, the asuw president issued an email to all uw students under the subject ""asuw response to the 04/26 post from the daily"" which claimed, without any context provided, that the daily had published ""racist imagery from the daily surrounding the current asuw elections"". i, like many of you, went to the subreddit and my friends in both the daily staff and the asuw to see what had happened and after which found a cartoon that was blown significantly out of proportion by the asuw.

i am extremely disappointed that the asuw leadership would abuse their power to email every uw student, regardless of subscription status, to paint the daily as racist out of nowhere to the entire student body over a few student's perception of one cartoon from one artist. the daily is a student-run organization that staffs many poc's and has always supported progressive student movements, protests, and actions. it is completely unfair for them to have someone with the power to email every student claim that they published racist imagery after the cartoon was removed and people can't even see the what was posted anymore. how is the daily even supposed to defend themselves if the narrative can be so easily controlled by one side? the calls for the daily to ""do better"" than the apology by donating from their already limited budget to things like mutual aid is outrageous and completely unnecessary. i saw one student say that ""y'all gotta pay reparations anyway"" so the poc staff for the daily better open up their wallets, i guess.

there needs to be consequences for whoever approved this abusive and manipulative email to be sent to the entire student body like this. all it has done is put the safety of the daily staff in jeopardy and given fuel for right-wing pundits to use to indoctrinate even more people who have an irrational fear of cancel culture. however, i for one do not want to wait for action to be taken and call for people to write in ""dubs i"" for every position to show that we are not okay with this kind of behavior from those who are supposed to protect and lift up our student organizations who fight for just causes, especially the press which highlights many civil rights and social justice issues facing the students in our school.

&#x200b;

tldr: the asuw president sent an email to every uw student out of nowhere and with no context claiming that the daily is racist over a cartoon that was no longer publicly available, unfairly controlling the narrative of the situation and putting the safety of the publicly listed staff of the daily in jeopardy.

&#x200b;

"a follow-up on my ""opinionated overview"" and how you can take appropriate action i have seen a lot of posts and calls for action that have good intent behind them, but after all i have learned and read in the last 24 hours, i fear that many of the petitions and calls for action may not actually result in the real, long-lasting change that many of us desire. many of you have read [my post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n0rlj3/opinionated_overview_the_whole_beef_between_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about the email that was sent out from the asuw president to every student. i was seeing a lot of talk solely about whether the cartoon was racist or not and my aim in making yesterday's post was to steer some of that discussion towards the abuse of power in sending that email the email that sparked all of this discussion. the post got a lot more attention than what i expected and now after nearly over 100 comments, over a dozen private messages, and the reading and rereading of other posts and articles, i feel as though i should do a bit more than encourage people to write-in ""dubs i"" for all of the positions.

first, to briefly highlight 2 important issues surrounding the controversy:

1. the inspiration behind the article and cartoon from the daily came from the fact that the eac (those who run the election at asuw) violated their own [elections policies and procedures](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/) (epp) by not properly spreading awareness about the election and surrounding deadlines to those outside of asuw. the tactics used by the daily to bring attention to this in their ""endorsement"" article are debatable at best, but nevertheless it is an important issue that needs to be discussed and [you can read more about how the nuances of the daily's article and the election problems in a reply i made in the original thread from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n0rlj3/opinionated_overview_the_whole_beef_between_the/gwbtqoz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
2. the mass email was a complete overreach and an abuse of power on the part of the asuw leadership. a personal email to every uw student claiming that our student-run paper published racist imagery targeting other students should never have been approved by a board of advisors or directors. an official statement surrounding the article and cartoon from the asuw is to be expected and no ill feelings should be sent their way simply for having their view on the matter, but this statement should have been made on social media where discussion about the cartoon and racial issues and biases could have actually occurred. this would have been a better approach than to just tell students what to think without means to respond in a meaningful way.

&#x200b;

**here's the part where you can learn how to take action:**

**for the issues surrounding the election itself:** the asuw has its own rules on elections they call the elections policies and procedures. ([http://vote.asuw.org/rules/](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/)). if any of you can find any part of those rules that you think the candidates, the board of directors, or the people running the election (which the rules call the 'eac') may have violated, **you can file a complaint before the 10th** using the pdf on this page ([http://vote.asuw.org/violations/](http://vote.asuw.org/violations/)). there are specific instructions for who to email the form to on that page too.

**important note:** if you submit a complaint ***you*** ***will have to attend a hearing on the 13th to make your case.*** if you do not show up, your complaint will be automatically thrown out. i understand that this may put a lot of people off because thus far have been able to remain anonymous but know that i will be filing a complaint and i will be attending the hearing myself if need be. i am certainly nervous about publicly standing up for this issue, attaching my name and face to these posts, but i feel strongly about this issue and i am willing to stand up for it. if you are a bipoc student or a member of another marginalized group who feels that, despite the diverse ballots, the asuw still does not do enough to address the issues you care about *now is your chance!* if the asuw wants to preserve that status quo by keeping election information under wraps and removing your opportunity to make an impact, make your own opportunity!

&#x200b;

**for the issues surrounding the email:** be wary of calls to recall camille hattwig. yes, the email is signed by her, but this does not mean the decision to send the email was all on her own. this may have been drafted and approved by a whole board of directors and simply signed in her name or something else entirely, but we do not know the process behind sending out emails like this. regardless of what you think of her or the asuw's opinion, we need to make changes to the way mass communication is made and petitions to simply recall the president will most likely (and somewhat ironically) be seen as an overreaction and not be taken seriously by anyone at the asuw or in the university administration.

the email is a bit harder to tackle and has a lot more a nuanced approach, so whatever you feel is necessary, i encourage you to do. having said that, i have set up a [petition](http://chng.it/ljm9fztctc) demanding an evaluation of why the email was sent, to make sure it never happens again, and that appropriate action is taken against whomever approved the email. here is the raw link for easy sharing: [http://chng.it/ljm9fztctc](http://chng.it/ljm9fztctc).

&#x200b;

thank you to everyone who has reached out to me and commented on my post. i really appreciate a lot of the thoughtful discussion that has been going on despite some outliers. i sincerely hope we are able to make the substantial change that many of us desire.

tldr: there are ways you can make more substantial and long-lasting change occur from this event than what has been proposed thus far. here is a link to the asuw policy violation complaint form: [http://vote.asuw.org/violations/](http://vote.asuw.org/violations/). here is a link to a petition aiming to resolve issues surrounding the email: [http://chng.it/ljm9fztctc](http://chng.it/ljm9fztctc).",psa

i might just be being neurotic, but i am so worried about not getting in lol. also, any idea if when i get in i could do a single online class to keep my spot, or can i defer an acceptance? in the middle of getting a medical separation from the af and they aren't exactly timely so i don't know if i will be fully out by the start of the fall like i was initially told.

"amath 35x or math 20x series hi all,

i'm currently a freshman engrud hoping for meche placement in the fall. since meche requires amath 301, i figured i should consider doing the optional replacement for math 20x with the amath 35x series which would guarantee me the amath minor with no extra work (assuming i'm placed into meche). i have some questions about the difference between the two different tracks, though. i was wondering what is the difficulty difference between amath and math for these series, as well as if amath 351 requires knowledge of python/matlab yet. i was planning to take amath 351 this summer since almost any engineering placement i'm interested in allows for it to fill a grad requirement, and then taking amath 301 in the fall since it isn't a guarantee i'll need that course if i don't get into meche. does amath 351 rely on python/matlab knowledge, or is it fairly similar to math 207 (307)? thanks in advance!",academics

"i feel like the whole uni is being my enemy i think i'm doing alright in academics, but when i attend class, or even thinking of going to campus this upcoming fall, i feel like everyone would gang up on me and throw hate, and even try to make fun of me; stress from studying doesn't bother me, but thinking of meeting a fellow student from uw is now a biggest fear i have now because i keep building anxiety of thoughts that everyone fucking hates me. and now it just turned into a scale of whole uni; i'm scared of even being here but i have to stay to graduate. 

i'm just done with everything, i'm fucking done. i don't want to feel like shit for not being able to express my opinion and always criticized for what i say; yes most of things were very dumb and i just ranted about things and apparently people got really mad and confused about it making me feel dumb but that's fine. but i guess no matter how nice i approach or how much i try, at least nobody in this school going to take me seriously and be friend or even acquaintance. ""people are usually nice here."" yes that might've been true to you, but not for me. or some of you might say ""you probably have never really try to be friends with them."" well i tried. i tried to talk to classmate and tried to be active on discussion, everything. and almost every single one of them treated my opinion and thoughts like a garbage. i feel like i'm extreme minority who never gets along. there was literally no room for me to really ""enjoy"" this place and opportunity i have without fearing the backfire and aftermath of me speaking up. 
but then you might say ""well if your opportunity is shit, that's what you get"". i think it's not civil when you try to put me down for having different opinion. 

i guess it started with imposter syndrome, but it turned into something bigger than i thought, and i just need a help. i'm gonna get downvotes but i just wanted to share a piece of thoughts. some of you might say ""well that's not what everyone thinks and people i've seen so far are nice so you are wrong."" i don't care how nice everyone was to you, my encounter and experiences in this place was terrifying and lonely all the time. i don't want to have a debate over if my feeling is right or wrong. just scroll down if me or this post bothers you because it's cringe. i know i am cringe for everyone but i think i'm still entitled to how i feel. i'm fucking terrified with this place.

"safety on the ave i am usually more of a lurker than a poster but i wanted to draw attention to the fact that a lot of women do not feel safe walking near campus. 

i can only share my own experiences but typically when i have experienced catcalling and unwanted attention near campus (the ave in particular) it’s usually men who are obviously older and more than likely don’t go to uw. just a few minutes ago, however, i had an interaction with a guy who was definitely of student age so i wanted to address it here. 

some context. i enjoy walking alone, it provides me some clarity in my typically hectic life. i know that can leave me “more vulnerable” but i take necessary safety precautions (even though i shouldn’t have to). i’m walking down the ave with my earbuds in and suddenly a guy crosses the street diagonally — in front of cars during a green light to cross over to me. honestly i didn’t think much of it until he tapped my wrist and gestured for me to take my earbud out. i did and then it’s a spew of “wow, i couldn’t help but notice your beauty and...” and i panic and start walking away. i had to keep turning every block or so to make sure he wasn’t following me, i was still on edge when i started writing this. for everyone here i would love to share some words of wisdom: when a woman — or anyone really — is walking alone (i don’t care if it’s night or day) approaching them while they are alone is already a bit sus and touching them is an absolute no. it’s not flattering, it’s invading personal space. also — if you do happen to compliment someone in this setting — you are not entitled to a reaction.

for this current quarter, i am taking a psychology class (not transferable/physiological psych 202), a philosophy bioethics class, and an english research paper class. my grades for this quarter are all teetering on low 89-90%s because of covid. 

i am close to completing my aa and psych major requirements, i only need three more quarters at bc. 

i also work at a medical research lab as a lab tech with experience in handling brain tissue, rodents, etc. 

i’d like to know what the average gpa for desired transfer students planning to get into the psychology major is, and specifically the gpa for classes that are stem vs non stem?

does it seem like i have a chance? i’m really worried i’ve dropped the ball with this quarter. i really want to get in so that this transfer process is behind me once and for all.",admissions

"[uw research study] adults needed to read words into a microphone! hi again [r/udub](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/),

we are a lab in the department of speech and hearing sciences here at uw and we're looking for adults to participate in some research studies.

in general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do not stutter (as well as children who stutter and children who do not stutter!) for a variety of experiments in which **you'll be compensated $15/hr**. we can **reimburse for street parking** and we will provide you with a **free hearing screening** as part of the experiment. children's experiments involve a free **speech and language evaluation** by a clinician as well as a small toy for your child.

most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words off a screen. we have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of covid-19.

if you are interested, or have any questions at all, please email us at [maxlab@uw.edu](mailto:maxlab@uw.edu)!

if you are not comfortable coming into the lab right now, or if you have a child that might be a good fit for our other studies, please still reach out and join our contact list for the future!

right now, i'm in engrud and finished all of the requirements to place into 6 engineering majors (hopefully aero/astro) except for engr 101. a lot of the next classes i would be taking for aerospace engineering were already full when i registered, so i did what i could to find classes that would still be interesting:

engr 101 & gen st 199, math 224 (nw), m e 123 (vlpa), ess 102 (i&s), astr 301 (nw).

i feel like i could probably do well even with 17 credits, but i'm worried that i might miss out on opportunities outside of class. looking on uwgrades, i think this would probably come out to around 32 hours per week. in any case, if any of you have been in a similar situation or dealt with a similar schedule, i would really appreciate any advice, and thanks in advance!",advice

for some background, i went to community college for my first two years of college. the pandemic started as i was finishing my last year at cc. so last year i attended uw completely online and have never been in a uw building while having finished my junior year here. considering i spent all of cc just going to school and working my ass off, ifs not like my cv accomplishments are long. the school i went two only had two clubs as well and neither of them were geared toward me.

i came into junior year thinking i’d make connections and maybe even find a mentor because i really don’t know what i’m doing and can use the nuanced advice the internet or my family can’t give. ofc being online (and depressed- i’ll admit if i had more energy i could have tried harder to make these connections but i was focusing on my gpa and being alive) i made zero connections with clubs, professors, or students. 

this has put me in a position to try and make up for the last year and my lack of anything before that. i need to do research, figure out multiple things regarding grad school, and also connect with at least three professors to a point they would confidently write me letters of recommendation. 

if we go online i’m truly scared i will learn nothing or accomplish nothing outside of a classroom setting. this makes me afraid because i know nothing about professional life or anything substantive about grad school and this last year of college is essentially my only opportunity to figure it out.",rant

"advice to my younger freshman self... ...from future you, who's been on campus for less than 2 quarters

1. please read up what panic attacks and anxiety looks like. cause when you took only half an edible and freaked out, you could've saved money by not going to the hospital. general rule of thumb, don't do anything new drug wise by yourself 

2. i don't care how cute it was when your first date with that junior was watching atla, trust him when he says he doesn't want a relationship. you're only hurting by staying and he is definitely not changing for you lol

3. make multiple friend groups. not just that group of people on your floor who gush about superbad. because trust me if (actually when) that group falls apart you're going to feel like the whole world is ending. make friends everywhere and you're going to be just fine

4. that best friend 3,000 miles away from you? not worth staying in your room convincing her to video call when friends at your door are holding snacks and ice cream because they wanted to support you during that friend breakup. sometimes you outgrow people from your past and that's ok. it just means you're getting closer to being the person you're meant to be 

5. don't walk alone at night on the ave and greek row. if that boy cared about you, he would've cared about your safety

6. flick the bean in the morning. don't care how horny you are because 2 seconds away from finishing you're going to accidently make eye contact with your roommate who also thought you were sleeping...

7. 4am at ode with friends and strangers is going to make you happier than that one frat party 

8. stop taking school so serious and get out of your room. trust yourself that the after class revision was enough 

9. water and center table's scrambled eggs the next morning. your keys are in the fridge btw

10. ice in that drink! don't grind on the guy dressed up as harry potter! go with three friends if you anticipate going home with some other girl!

10. actually no take your studies seriously. after that first midterm, midterm season doesn't stop until 2 weeks before the end of quarter. get back on that smh

11. just know no matter what you did your best. you aren't perfect and no one is. even that girl who seems to have everything (4.0 in cse, a bf, perfect outfits, perfect body, etc.) focus on doing your best.

12. stop taking everything so goddamn personal. you aren't the moon kissing the night sky. you have to sing under the sea with all your heart. you have to shovel cheerios 2 mins before your 8:30 because you know you aren't going to function later. you have to pause for a minute and just admire those corgis. you have to stop spending hours after a test figuring out your grade and then your back up major. you've got to stop trying to make your neighbors like you. fuck it kid. you've got to love yourself.

13. i'm proud of you even if mom doesn't tell you. your value doesnt go down when she yells at you for not carrying your tracker (sorry i mean cellular device) everywhere. you aren't a whore

14. that guy from madrona? that girl from calc? those people you randomly met? i can't wait for you to get to know them because you're going to find so much love. open your heart to then and watch how you heal in a healthy environment. you deserve this

15. be boundless even if the campaign ends next year",advice

you know, i used to hate ana marie. now i realize she is the only one around here with a fucking brain. if she was like you dumb fucks, she would’ve announced online for the next 10 years just in case we get the occasional covid-19 case or two (remember that virus? yeah me neither). but nope, she had a brain, and y’all are going in-person thanks to that.


“but but…a school in texas is going online!”


have you fucking seen greg abbott? have you fucking seen him? have you fucking seen the vaccination rates over there? do you really wanna play this dumb fucking game of comparing **texas** to **seattle**, you know, the fucking city that had a cop-free zone not too long ago with extremely high vaccination rates?


guys, please laugh with me for a second 😂 can you fucking imagine the packed dorms (mcmahon included) being sent home because of a resurgence of a virus that ~100% of the student population is vaccinated against? 😂😂😂😂 fucking lmao.


i will say it again, loud and clear for your ape brains to understand: **you are going in-person. you will have to ask mommy and daddy for school supplies and get your first day of school outfit ready and make sure you aren’t late to your first day honey! and last but not least, shut. the. fuck. up with these fucking doomsday posts about omg we might go online 🥺 because no you fucking won’t unless covid-20 spawns and the vaccines no longer work, but even then you probably won’t because we do not give a flying fuck anymore.**


and to all the crybabies that want zoom because “delta is scary” 🥺 and will “kill your entire family” 💀….eat my ass. no more cheating on exams for you lmaoooo back to in-person you fucking shitter hahahahah. you don’t think we see your masked bullshit? you aren’t scared of delta, you want easy stay-at-home classes with buffed gpas. well guess what kid? you’re going to campus! **pack your fucking shit!** 😂

"uw bs parking scheme so if you're a commuter student like me i'm sure you're pretty irritated at the new online portal bs system. not only have all permit rates been increased, but if you're like me and only needed it on certain days of the week like mwf, and found that the portal forces you to pay for all days of the week for the e18 ""value"" pass, then here's a little tip that'll prolly save you a lot of dough. first, do not pay for this absolute rip-off of a permit. if you already have, cancel it immediately! instead, use the paybyphone app which lets you park in the exact same lot (plus other lots) and lets you pay on a day by day basis. although you have to remember to pay for the pass everyday, this can literally save you around $150+ (mwf only) as opposed to the uw shitty portal e18 ""value"" pass. uw transportation services should be ashamed of themselves to have removed the ability to select the days you want to park for the quarter which they had previously with the paper-tag passes. please save your money and do yourself a favor and use the paybyphone app.

"for those that use the burke-gilman trail this is probably obvious to many, but i’d just like to put out a reminder to those who use the trail for any reason to always be alert of what’s going on around you. a couple days ago i had a man pull up on me in his car and ride next to me despite my obvious disinterest in his efforts to get my attention, and today was hit with a “dont f**king ignore me” when i didn’t take my headphones out for some guy, who then proceeded to walk next to me for most of my walk home (there was no good place to get off to get away sooner). 

even though it’s annoying, it’s best to keep a headphone out or have the volume low enough to be aware of what’s going on around you at all times. if you feel like anyones following you, get off the trail the next chance you get and call someone to stay on the phone with in the meantime. carrying pepper spray on you at all times is worth considering, if you don’t already. ultimately, particularly if you are alone, i’d recommend avoiding the trail altogether even if the alternative is less convenient.",psa

"it's that time again; guys if you're going to approach a girl in public, here's how to do it we're back on campus and haven't talked to people on campus in over a year. it's weird and we're all socially (and probably touch) deprived. if you want to make friends or find a potential partner, chances are you've considered the cold-approach of just walking up to a cute stranger and asking them out.

for reasons you may never fully understand, this can be scary for women. always has been, always will. as a woman who's had this happen a not-insignificant number of times, it really depends on the situation. sometimes it's straight-up predatory, and even if you aren't a creep, we still have to be prepared for that. we get that some people are really trying to be nice, but it's awkward because of the timing/location/lack of social skills so here's some advice:

the best of intentions can still make moments like this plenty upsetting! pick your time/place carefully-- if she's near the front of a 30 min line at the suzzalo starbucks, she's not going to be able to leave if she feels uncomfortable. also 9am is a little early to get hit on, at least let her finish her coffee.

don't open with a comment on physical appearance (unless it's to compliment a specific piece of clothing or pin or something you have in common). we already know that's what got your attention. you can work in a compliment whilst flirting, but don't start there-- there are plenty of things more interesting about her than her physical appearance, and she'll be very impressed if you manage to convey that in the first 20 seconds. instead, start with a greeting that gives her a chance to answer how she's doing and importantly, if this is a good time to talk (you're not more important than cramming for a midterm, so if that's what's happening at the library then don't drag it out). if you get a conversation going, offer small bits of information like what/where your housing is or what your year/major is-- just things that turn you into a real person in her head instead of a random stranger from who-knows-where). keep this convo brief-- even if she seems interested, a) she's probably also still in the middle of something, and b) you don't want to play your whole hand at once-- leave her wondering more about you. the more you talk the more likely it is she'll hear something that kills her interest. if your goal is a date, wait til then before you start diving into how compatible you might be.

now for your exit strategy-- this is the most important part. even if it's going well, if it's not a good time or she seems uncomfortable here's what you should say/do: ""anyways, i'm \[insert name here\], i should probably get going but i'd really like to get to know you better. can i give you my number/snapchat?"" (if you managed to find a common hobby, invite her to participate in said hobby with you). and then here's the kicker- do not give her your phone or ask for hers. give your number/snap to her on a piece of paper, old-fashioned style (but write it out in front of her so it doesn't look like you've been handing out business cards to every other girl). you don't really have to wait for an answer, just hand it to her/leave it on the table, and make a swift exit (throw in a ""have a nice day"" or even a ""talk to you later!"" if you're feeling bold).

it may catch her off guard, but in a good way-- it'll make you stand out and seem classier, more like the male lead of her fave 2000s rom com and less like someone who just hits on girls as a hobby and collects numbers like pokemon cards. this also gives her the chance to decide if she's interested without the fear of someone she doesn't know having her contact information, or having someone hover over her to make that decision on the spot. less of a chance of a knee-jerk ""no"" reaction. if she's interested, she'll reach out. if not, drop it. you don't want to chase after someone who isn't interested in you anyways.

a few final notes on flirting/the conversation itself:  
\- confidence is by far the most important thing-- if you seem nervous, she's gonna think you're swinging out of your league and she shouldn't settle (related-- don't swing out of your league; aka don't pick the hottest person you see, pick someone who might pick you too)

\- smile and try to get her to smile; you don't have to be funny but be nice

\- plan what you're going to ask her before you approach, but don't try to memorize a script-- find something specific about her to ask about, it's much easier for her to talk about herself than follow a random topic of conversation

\- again, keep it brief. the longer you interrupt her day, the greater the chance of annoying her to saying no for reasons unrelated to your charms

finally, this is not the ideal way to meet someone-- you should really use this as a last resort if you don't have any opportunities to meet people in your classes or at a club meeting or through friends

y'all are gonna shoot your shot anyways though so hopefully this'll save everyone involved from a very awkward encounter. good luck gents",advice

"best and worst classrooms first time attending classes in-person. here are the best and the worst classroom in my opinion, feel free to comment!

&#x200b;

***best***

* *pcar 192*: the rolly chair is so comfortable and the charger is so convenient, i never feel sleepy for an 8:30am class. paccar and dempsey are probably the best buildings on campus!
* *smi 120*: the legroom is not bad at all. plus the middle row has large table and extra legroom. 
* *den 212*: large tables are great for writing and everything. i can put my laptop and notebook without pushing my classmate.
* *gwn 201*: despite not having chargers, the table and interior are fascinating. again, large table are amazing.

&#x200b;

***worst***

* *cdh 128*: the room is awful despite i never had a class there. imagine it's storming outside and the door opens, your notebook or exam is wet.
* *ece 105*: it looks like a cool auditorium, but it's so steep. i never had classes there but who likes the feeling when someone on the back kicking your head? also, no panopto equipped.
* *chl 015*: this room is too small to fit in 50 people, no social distancing at all.",student life

"living in a post-2020 world and trying to be strong again **tldr: i feel a bit silly but i thought that coming back to uw in-person would fix my depression.  however i have to accept that things are never going to be the same and that even before the pandemic, i wasn't in a great place.  being grateful for what i have now is not enough to make me ""happy.""** 

during 2020, i spent a lot of my time idolizing what my life at uw used to be like and crying because i found out the bio department rejecting me on the basis of the satisfactory progress policy.  i had put a lot of hard work and time into the prereqs and keeping my gpa up (at the time, i had a 3.8 gpa, which has only declined ever since).  finding out that they were rejecting me not because of a lack of competence, but rather because of an arbitrary credit limit, made me feel powerless and like the school was throwing me out like a piece of trash. 

i love my parents, but i couldn't stand living with them either.  my mom is a first generation immigrant who grew up in a cage home and couldn't find it in herself to be sympathetic to my situation.  as someone who grew up in much worse conditions, my depression was confusing and inconvenient to her, so she would punish me for my lack of enthusiasm in my online classes even though i am 20 and too old to be disciplined like a child.  because of this, i would idolize being able to move back to seattle and live by myself again.  however, she refused to allow me to apply for summer quarter even after i got vaccinated with both shots, and refused to help pay for campus housing.  she also refused to let me move in with my (also vaccinated) friend, so i assumed i was not allowed to apply for campus housing at all.  as a consequence, i was not able to meet the campus housing application on time and had to scrounge to find a apartment before school started. 

i guess i should state that i am still grateful now that i got back all the small things that i wanted.  i saw how privileged i was, that i was able to live near campus and have access to food and a private room where i could talk openly about being a queer person of color without fearing repercussion.  that is something i am not taking for granted and truly appreciate.  i am grateful that i now live near my poc friends again, after a year of trying to make myself palatable to my white conservative friends.  i am extremely thankful to be back in seattle and to have control over my life again and not having to worry about being thrown out of the house again in the middle of the night, and that nobody is threatening to cut off my hair for misbehaving.  when i was at my worst point last year, i jumped out of a moving car just to avoid continuing a conversation with my mother, and now that i am no longer living with her, i feel like my emotions are much more under control.

and yet... i guess i am not completely satisfied because i now realize that even though i was privileged enough to get access to vaccines and a safe place to live, i will never fully recover the life or person that i was before march 2020.  some of this is due to the pandemic, some is this is just due to the changes of adulthood.  after i got a job, i realized just how hard it is to balance work/studying and no longer find joy in going to class.  i tried to ignore this until it became too hard to balance things and i got a covid scare because i was neglecting myself so badly that i started showing symptoms of fatigue and nausea.  i'm super thankful that the test came back negative, but receiving the email from my manager telling me that they were forcibly terminating me a week early due to my incompetence was very hard to bear.  i've grown distant from the theater group that i spent three years with, and i don't think they can ever accept me again.  i'm also finding it harder to remember to feed myself and am constantly running out of food.  some of my friends have transferred to a different country, or no longer live close enough to just grab a bite together when i'm feeling down.  we're adults with our own responsibilities now.  although i am glad that i've stuck with only one or two of my friends for social distancing reasons, i miss the days when i felt like i was part of a group.  i'm starting to truly understand what one of my friends meant when they told me that being in stem really is a lonely path.  

in the past, i didn't have an issue with this.  when i came here as a sixteen year old, i was very self-disciplined and i enjoyed spending time with myself.  i never had a problem with making friends, even though i didn't particularly seek them out, and whenever i didn't have friends, i simply took myself out to places and had a good time.  whether i was cold, whether i was hungry, whether i was sick (this was before covid of course), i would force myself out of bed at 8 in the morning to go to an uncomfortable 300-student kane hall classroom and study at odegaard and clue until 11 pm every day.  now, i realize that i don't feel comfortable studying anywhere because i can't eat simultaneously (due to covid restrictions, all of which are perfectly understandable) and because ode kicks out students earlier than before.  i used to be a straight-4.0 student but now i can barely get myself out of bed most days. i can't tell you when was the last time i actually sat down in an actual class.  

i would normally advise someone in my own situation to stop taking three stem a quarter and drop my most difficult class, but as someone who is constantly being haunted by my credit limit, i feel like that would be a huge waste.  the university and the department that i would claw tooth and bone to get into have made it clear that they are fine with dropping me the instant i go over my limit, so every upper division bio class that i can get into is a luxury, not a right.  i also cannot bear to waste any tuition money on any classes that will not count towards the degree i want.  the instant my gpa falls below 3.0 or that i go over my credit limit, i feel like upper administration may use it against me and block my registration until i finally agree to stop pursuing bio. just from looking through this reddit, i guess my next best option is to transfer (maybe to uwt), but i am not sure if this would make me happy because this has been my dream school and i fought so hard just to get back to this place, as pathetic as that may seem.  yes, i know i'm clinging onto a dumpster fire, but it's my dumpster fire and i spent all of 2020 wishing and trying to manifest my way back here. 

honestly, i just kind of want my friends back and i wish i had more people in my life so i would have a reason to get out of bed.  

has anyone else experienced a similar situation to this? if so, how have you been dealing with this? do you also feel the same way, and have you been able to make time to mourn the person you used to be and move on? how are you trying to recover and get back on your feet again, and were you able to find someone to help you out of it?",rant

"in-person exams/covid - what to do? hey, i’m looking for advice on what to do in this situation. i’m currently in a large lecture class (400ish students) that is conducted in person with panopto as an option for lecture content.

since the beginning of the year, we have had a handful of covid cases in the class, which have been ramping up lately. after the first of these i decided it wasn’t worth the stress to attend in person and stopped going. 

however, we also have in-person exams which you are required to attend. the professor doesn’t offer make up exams (one exam is dropped from the final grade) so there is a lot of pressure to go even if you are sick. lots of people coughing, sneezing, etc, in a lecture hall where there isn’t space to socially distance.

this is mildly frustrating normally but you can kind of work with it, just lay low for a few days after the exam and get a covid test. however the next exam is the day before thanksgiving. many students are concerned about contracting covid during the exam and then exposing their families when they go home. is there anything we can do other than just take the l and not show up to the exam?",advice

my friend huckleberry kid was assaulted on january 5th at the dockside cannabis in shoreline. two men robbed the store armed with guns and opened fire as he went to check their ids at the door. he was hit in the arm, leg, and torso, suffering nerve damage to his hand and foot and punctures to his liver, colon and stomach. we're beginning the process of getting him home; he'll be living with me, his girlfriend, and some other friends. he's a good man, the kind that is giving, warm, and safe to be you around. there isn't anyone less deserving of this happening to them.

this is going to be a long road, and we'd appreciate some help to cover huck's expenses - just basic costs will be around $75k this year between rent, utilities, food, and therapy. all of us are at uw or recent grads, so time and money are tight. if you have the capacity to donate, thank you. if you can't, that's totally ok. we'd appreciate if you could share this on your socials to get better visibility.

"abt the crime in the area i’m originally from a city with high rates of murders and whatnot. talking like once i was walking down the street, there were firefighters taking down an arson fire in one building and cops dealing with a hostage situation in the building next door. i’ve been shot at a couple times too. so i think i have good advice. 

so, here’s my advice to avoid these crimes happening in the area. 

if you go anywhere, go with three or more people. don’t go out alone after sunset. 

because the weapon being used is a taser, you can run. don’t even try to fight, throw your valuable items onto the ground and just run. 

a lot of people believe these are human traffickers. most traffickers just lure young people in and manipulate them over a long period of time. these are robbers, they don’t want your body, they want your stuff. 

if these people talk to you, speak in a slow clear voice and say exactly what you’re going to do in every motion, “i am going to hand you my cell phone/keys/whatever.” you absolutely do not want them to think you are a threat, as they will just attack you. 

if you are restrained or fear they are going to move you to a second location, then you start freaking out. scream, flail, act wildly. be so inconvenient that they don’t want to mess with you. attract so much attention, they have to drop you.

last resort if you think someone is following you, start filming and confront them and tell them to stop following you. this is really a last resort. if there’s no one around to help you and you feel you can’t outrun them, this is your final call. 

if they don’t stop following you, act like a crazy, mentally insane person. like foaming, gurgling, off the rocker insanity. they will not want to be anywhere near you. 

this is my advice, i hope you guys find it helpful!",advice

"bruh y’all are rich (y’all as a generalization) 

i thought people weren’t serious when they said most students at uw could afford to live on campus. so far, almost every person i’ve met lives on campus. 

anyway, i did cashiering today at noodle, as opposed to my usual prep job, and i was shocked. 

almost every single student had $800+ dollars on their husky card. 

like, i’m assuming it’s not the exact same exchange rate as usd, it’s just husky money, but damn! the rich people at this school can afford to have anything they want, whenever! 

i’m not saying it’s bad to be rich, i’m just shocked by how different uw is from cc. like, most students don’t work and go to school. most students live on campus. most have 100s of dollars a quarter for high quality food. 

uw is a culture shock for me, in terms of wealth. anyone else relate to this?

edit:

i do know many people take out loans to live here, i was just noting how many people i have met that have been so casually wealthy that they don’t seem to process it. this post is not about scholarship loan students.  

for example, several people in my class told me how their parents pay for their entire tuition and everything else for them. again, not bad, but i just felt so surprised by how common that is here. it’s interesting to me.

double edit: 

once again, i’m directly referring to the casually wealthy students i see. the canada goose jackets, the patagonia coats, the lv wallets. 

all my food is from work or the food bank, i am a low income student observing the environment i have been placed in. if that is offensive to you, that’s fine.

"my life feels like it’s in shambles when it’s not hi uw friends. i hope no one recognizes me from this, but i have no one to talk to and i just feel like everything is falling apart. to keep it short, i feel like everyone around me hates me, including my close friends. i feel so insecure in my friendships to the point where i misinterpret normal text messages as them being annoyed or sick of me. they’ve reassured me before that they don’t hate me but i can’t shake the feeling. i don’t know why. and i’m afraid to keep asking them because i know for sure that it’ll start to get on their nerves. 

it’s weird. i spend time with my friends and i feel great! but then after, i think about everything i did wrong. i spoke too loudly. i made a stupid joke. i sounded idiotic. i looked and felt out of place. they all secretly loathe my presence. it’s all stuff like that. i used to be insecure in high school but with college, i feel like it’s a 100 times worse. 

i don’t know how to feel about life. school is okay. i get along with my family for the most part. it’s just the people. i feel so pathetic and so ugly inside that i don’t even want to tell anyone about this. i just want to disappear. i don’t want anyone to see how desperate and shameful and embarrassing i am and it eats me up inside. i feel like i can’t even enjoy living because of it. 

i’m not really looking for advice bc i posted this to just finally get this out somewhere. but if anyone has any kind words i would really appreciate that. thank you. i hope you’re all doing well. i hope that life feels fair to you.",rant

"help husky table tennis club go to nationals!! (donation) hello! we are the husky table tennis club at the university of washington!! 

we just made it through divisionals in oregon and we are currently preparing to go to regionals in california in two weeks!! our team is even one of the most likely candidates to make it all the way to the nationals tournament in texas!!

despite all our renowned success, our club has a huge deficiency when it comes to funding. husky table tennis club was re-established last year post-covid-19, so we lack the funding that matches our potential. 

furthermore, as we are not affiliated with the university of washington athlete teams, we do not get any funding from the school side. therefore, we desperately need the funding for our regional and national tournaments.  

any level of donation is greatly appreciated and we thank you for your support!!

at last, come and join us on regular practice in ima! it is fun! the first time is free but there is a $25 ($60 for the whole year and waived for club officers) fee if you do like it which is much cheaper than other places :)  it's at gym b every monday, thursday 19:00-22:00 and saturday morning 10:00-13:00. we also have tryouts approximately every quarter if you are interested to become a team member.",event

regardless of whether you get in or not, realize that a college decision does not define you in any way. you are just as smart and capable regardless of whether or not you get accepted to your dream school. 

i was in your position two years ago and i understand how stressful this time can be with the anticipation of whether or not you’ll get in mixed with potential disappointment and excitement too. it’s so many emotions at once that it can be overwhelming sometimes. take time to yourself so that you take care of your mental health. also make sure you celebrate your wins too even if you’re disappointed by some of the decisions you get. after all, making it this far is a pretty big deal and you deserve to feel proud of yourself for all of the hard work you put in.

please don’t let a less than ideal decision take away from your self worth or peace of mind. you’ll end up where you’re meant to be and you’ll get a great education regardless of where you end up going. honestly, beating yourself up about a decision just isn’t worth the time and emotional turmoil. trust me, i’m speaking from experience.

so yeah, all in all just relax this upcoming month or so and trust that things will work out one way or another in end :)",advice

"rant: i’m tired of my friend not paying attention to me. it feels a bit juvenile for me to cry about this, but i made a friend at the beginning of the winter quarter here at uw. we both come from the same hometown and a common friend intro’d us. ever since, i’ve looked at this friend as a major support. i’m fairly new to the seattle area and this friend has been here since 2 years. i found myself counting on them many times, even though i never asked them for any real help. now they’re graduating and moving away. i think we’re not as great friends in reality as i’d assumed in my head. they’re nice to me, but barely pay any attention now. if i go back to our texts, i can only find me starting the convos and them responding well, but never really starting it. i think they slowly realized they don’t like me as much and i have to leave it at that. also, i feel they’re at a different stage in life than me - i’m trying to get a job and also looking at grad programs while they have found a great job already and can afford to hang out with other friends to take roadtrips almost everyday. i’m both happy and jealous because i can’t hang out with them and whenever i ask them, they seem to be genuinely busy. i totally get that you can’t be friends with everyone. but it does hurt to know that we started out so nicely only for them to lose interest now. i guess i really wanted us to be each others besties lol. didn’t work out. hope i find new friends soon. thanks for reading my rant.",rant

"admitted student looking for guidance — @ uw premeds, please be brutally honest with me. hi everyone! i was admitted to uw for pre-sciences with the goal of studying biology. my #1 dream is medical school and i really want to make sure that i'm setting myself up to succeed in undergrad. if anyone here has insight into the experience of being premed at uw, it would be a huge help.

i'd be very grateful for guidance around these general questions:

1. is it difficult to get directly into a bio major, especially considering there is no direct admit? what is the app process like?
2. how brutal are the class curves, and how has your own experience been with staying ahead of the average? how many hours a day do you typically study, and do you feel like it's feasible?
3. what is the process of gaining research / shadowing around seattle like? i've heard of opportunities at fred hutch
4. ultimately what would you choose if you were given these options for undergrad:

(1) **uw seattle** — admitted pre-sciences, you probably know more about it than i do. love the location and social fit

(2) **santa clara university** — admitted for biology, grade inflation, but no r1 research status or much name recognition. would go there freshman year while trying to transfer

(3) **baylor university** — admitted for neuroscience, $56,000 merit scholarship to my top choice program in the honors college, grade inflation. they recently gained r1 research status, but it's an absolutely terrible social/cultural fit and i wouldn't like the location

anyways, here’s my thought process. 

-public health. 
-health of the “public” (of your choosing)
-well-being of said public
-mental well-being
-caring about others well-being (i wish i knew why)
-opportunity to analyze/solve multifaceted problems for the little things we think matter.
-research->inform->educate->inspire 

“mom, i’m majoring in public health because i want to offer a different perspective to complicated problems that others argue aren’t worth the energy(bigger fish to fry) and/or $$…for the little guy.”

i care about diversifying healthcare and increasing access to marginalized communities. 

my ph classmates are all literally the nicest, coolest, and most compassionate people i’ve ever met, and the world is better with them in it. they literally made me a better person (changed some perspectives of mine) just by voicing their thoughts.

hey tacoma huskies,

uw tacoma has partnered with the rape, abuse, and incest national network (rainn) to deepen community members’ knowledge and skills related to sexual misconduct awareness, prevention, and response through a campus-wide, virtual training session via zoom wednesday, april 20th, 2022, 2:00-4:00 p.m.

data received from the 2019 university-wide climate survey revealed that employee and student survey respondents who were aware of sexual and gender harassment prevention training being available at uw overwhelmingly believed it positively influenced the uw climate. 

* **75.37%** of faculty believe such training for faculty positively influenced the climate.1 
* **81.37%** of staff believe such training for staff positively influenced the climate.1
* **84.21%** of students believe such training for students positively influenced the climate.1

additionally, students shared that they believed prevention training is important for staff and faculty. 

* **86.25%** of students believe such training for faculty and staff positively influenced the climate.1

all uw tacoma students are encouraged to attend this free virtual training, and the importance of student participation cannot be over-emphasized. your participation is vital in creating and maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for students, faculty, and staff.

so, keep your eyes open for more rainn training announcements and save the date: wednesday, april 20th, 2022.

"looking to form a music collective (uw based) hello **artists, producers, audio engineers, songwriters, graphic arts designers, and video creators of uw**. i'm reaching out through the uw subreddit in hopes to find people who are interested in forming a music collective. not a boyband, but a collective where everyone, including people not directly working on the music, can take part in a project. similar to one of brockhampton and dpr.   


my goal is to establish a collective where we can explore multiple genres as a group. so i'm looking for open-minded people who are able to appreciate and respect the artistry of all artists. and what i mean by that is those who don't diss certain artists just cus they ""strayed"" from their old styles. for example, *""the new kanye sucks,"" ""keshi was better when he made depressing songs,""* etc. having personal tastes in music is good but i am hoping to avoid people with certain prejudices, especially those who commonly say shit like *""this is trash,"" ""\_\_\_\_ is overrated,"" ""\_\_\_\_\_ is an industry plant.""* artists make certain decisions with their work to express themselves in different ways and i want to find people who can see and notice that and are overall positive about music.   


having high standards is great but those whose personal judgments might prevent the group from being able to comfortably explore all sorts of genres and niche styles would not be pog. we all have main genres we listen to and enjoy, like i mainly write sad shit with minimal instruments, but i really want to try to make more hype songs and i think doing so as a group would be exciting. so far i'm interested in trying out **antipop, indie, rnb, and hyperpop** stuff. you don't need to have a lot of music experience to join but i wanna meet you and see if you're someone i vibe with.  


i want to have this collective help people improve through shared experiences and make good friends. the collective won't be too huge so there will be certain limited roles that i'll be looking for. (like i don't think we'll need like 20 rappers lmao.) also, from my own experiences with a large music community it can be difficult to manage projects ;-; .   


hopefully once we get this formed we can set goals throughout the school year for projects. i'll put a playlist of genres that i have in mind that i want to explore and if you are also interested feel free to fill out the google form below and we can meet up :) .

i've been living in the u-district for two years now, and holy shit, i had no idea things could get as bad as they have with my current landlord. i don't want to name him publicly until i move out at the end of this month out of concern for retaliation, but if you pm me i'll gladly give his name. i have been forced to live in absolutely disgusting conditions that the landlord either refuses to fix or at least refuses to hire outside help for. my freezer doesn't work and he ignored my text about it. my wall was leaking orange goop, and he said it must be a leak, ""took a look"", and then decided it wasn't a leak. i did the research and found out it was because he didn't dehumidify the space before painting the walls, and i told him that. he literally just said ""that's so strange"" as orange goop was slowly dripping onto everything i owned. the apartment feels soaking wet. everything gets moldy. there's nowhere to store shit in a way that doesn't get moldy. his solution was to give us a single dehumidifier, and not do his job to find out why the apartment is wet to the fucking touch. slugs were entering our home for several months. how did slugs get in? there are roots growing through the seal on my window. our billion year old stove spontaneously ignited. he took the batteries out of our carbon monoxide detectors and said it was because he was going to give us new ones. that was nine months ago. 

so please, share the names and companies that have fucked you over. nobody deserves to live in such disgusting conditions. we thought the landlord seemed like a good guy, but oh my god. he completely ignored my last text telling him that our freezer isn't working right. i've easily lost $100 or more on food that was no longer safe because it completely thawed and i don't feel like getting listeria!

"the return to husky stadium pulled off a bottle episode according to tv tropes, a bottle episode is ""designed to take up as little money as possible. the easiest way to go about this is to use only the regular cast (or even just part of the regular cast) and set it in a single location, especially if you have a main standing set. this keeps production costs down, because no-one needs to scout locations, build new sets, or create fancy cgi graphics of the outside of the spaceship.""

in the return to husky stadium, we see a direct example of the bottle episode, where the showrunners played clips of previous speeches by ana mari cauce, asuw and gpss presidents. the most recent clip occurred yesterday during the 147th regular ceremony showing a portion of gpss president aaron yared.

this ceremony can also be read by tropers as a clip show.

the deadline for signing up is going to be the 18th of august and we will host tryouts through august 19-20 at 7 pm (these times are subject to change depending on the number of sign ups). once on the team, players will have the chance to practice together and play in tournaments throughout the whole school year, and ultimately compete in the ulol tournament that starts in spring quarter. when i was on the team a couple years ago, we had many opportunities to bond outside of just playing the game, and it was a good way to meet new people and make new friends as well as developing skills in working with a team. players will also receive their own custom uw esports jerseys later on in the year and have special access to the hub gaming lounge. only uw students enrolled for this coming school year are allowed to play on the team. please read the form carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact ng37@uw.edu or lost#5106 on discord. 

as a side note, the competition to get onto the collegiate team as a starter will be very vigorous, with multiple masters+ players trying out. don't let this dissuade you from trying out; there have been times in the past where d4 players have won out over gm players in tryouts because of other factors than their rank. and if you aren't successful at making it onto the collegiate team, there will be more opportunities to play in other diamond + teams as a uw student in a more relaxed environment focused on development and preparing players to tryout again in the future.

hope to see you apply! a lot of incoming freshmen who play league aren't in our discord server yet since the school year hasn't started yet so i thought this post would be important to get more applicants from people who aren't currently in the pcm discord.",psa

"chances of being admitted as a freshman in marine biology after graduating hs over 8 years ago? i know marine biology is an open major, but i'm not sure if that means i would automatically get accepted to uw or if they still have a chance of denying me. i assume the latter.

i currently live in washington near seattle. i graduated from high school in texas in 2014 with a 3.64 gpa. i took some dual credit college courses and pre-ap classes, but not actual ""ap"" classes. my junior and senior years were kind of 50/50, where some of my grades went up and some went down, including the college courses i took.

i mentioned band a lot in my accomplishments, such as becoming a private tutor for the beginner band students in my own time as well as winning medals at state. i believe my essays were well written, and everyone agreed so far. i also mentioned unique hardships i've faced in obtaining my education, such as becoming a victim of an attempted homicide earlier this year and having to drop classes online due to financial constraint that stemmed from this.

my school's third semester falls under summer term or the optional third term?

2. what is trimester block?

my school did a trimester system, day 1/day 2 rotations with 4 blocks per day. does that fall under trimester block or just trimester?

3. what is credits?

my school only has transcripts for grades 10-12 so previous courses technically don't have credits? note my second language and arts are done in grades 8 and 9.

4. do i have provide context for why my school changed from trimester to quarterly to semester?

my grades 8 and 9 are trimester, but 10 is quarterly and 11 and 12 are semester. if needed where would i write this?

5. do i have to provide context for missing term 3 marks for grade 9?

my school went online during that time so we didn't receive a third term mark but some of my courses *did* get marks bumped up. if needed, where would i write this?

6. what do i do if i don't have an american phone number as specified in ad-3.a and ad-3.b?

i'm canadian.

7. do i need to report if i've taken a course early? 

like if i've done physics 11 while i'm in grade 10",admissions

"@officialhumansofuw initiative hello all 

i and another student have launched an initiative [officialhumansofuw](https://www.instagram.com/officialhumansofuw/) (link to page) to provide university of washington students and alumni a voice to share their story. it's all about hearing your story if you are willing to share it, whether it's struggling with health or other things/rant/happiness/anything really. 

**idea:** when people read what you're going through, they're more likely to speak out and connect with you about potentially similar happiness/struggles - there are probably 1000s of individuals on campus who'd be like ""same, me too, but i was struggling to speak about it"". this is something i've always wanted to do because i enjoy photographing and listening to people - i believe there is always a side of fear and vulnerability that is different from what we generally see on social media.

**how it'd work:** the way we want this to function is to allow the individual sharing the story complete control over whether they want to reveal their identity/photo/parts of the story or remain anonymous. we publish based on the person's consent - a-z side of what comes out and give them the opportunity to speak/show what they want.

if you're interested, you may follow the instagram page and share it among your friends - [officialhumansofuw](https://www.instagram.com/officialhumansofuw/) (and dm your story if you like). furthermore, i am open to any suggestions/volunteering to join us in this attempt. so far i have created a terrible logo but we plan to improve everything. thank you so much.",event

i want to apply for direct admission to comp sci, because i initially heard that if you don't get into the major, they won't reject you because of it. however, i recently heard from a current student that they have started rejecting those who do not get into comp sci so students wouldn't ""hang around waiting for something they will never get into,"" and have to go through an appeal process and change majors.

if this is the case, wouldn't it be better to decide on something that doesn't require direct admit (ex. informatics, which i would be more than willing to do) if i don't have a stellar chance at majoring in cs? i would also like to know my chances of getting into uw in general.

fast forward to today, im like i recognize this smell.. and i look and low and behold are the cursed socks under her bed. except this time they smell even worse. the combo of air freshener i sprayed and the socks was so bad that i got a headache and had to leave the room and do my assignment in the kitchen lounge.  so i send her another dm asking her to move them again and she responds 5 hrs later saying yeah sorry. and when i come back into the dorms at like 10ish pm they're still there😭 so at this point i just move them to the bathroom so they can be contained somewhere and they are solid, like.. i think that says enough (+ w a hairball stuck to it so 2 for 1 ahaha..).

 she comes back to the dorm finally and i tell her abt it and i ask her where the laundry bag is and shes like idk and shes in her bed about to sleep, socks still in the bathroom and so i just as of right now ive moved them to her closet bc i just cant anymore (not to mention she doesnt take out the trash and i had to even tho ive reminded her multiple times and we literally all agreed to split up the cleaning and hers is trash each week). 

what gets me is the way she just kinda dismisses everything when im like bro ur socks.. and the fact that when i dm her she leaves me on seen and then in person tells me she saw the dm and then it just sucks cuz the next time i wanna be like can u take out the trash it just seems like im being bossy but she just never replies. anyways so sorry this was too long but yeah 

tldr: roommate's socks are under her bed bc she takes off shoes and puts them there, and they're so stinky i got a headache while trying to do hw in the room and the socks are solid. they were also in the room all day. + she never takes out trash even tho its her assigned split chore between all 3 of us.

now i’m in my senior year and it’s registering that i only have 1 person i’ve met here that i can picture having regular contact with in a year’s time. i’ve only got 2, maybe 3 people here i feel comfortable calling my friends. going through the pandemic at uw really murdered my social life. 

i know that lost friendships over the lockdowns was a common gripe, but i haven’t been able to compensate. i like the folks in my rsos, but no one in either really clicks with me. i try to make friends in class, but that almost always goes nowhere. honestly how does anyone manage to get to know their classmates in the span of a quarter????? it’s so hard to get a bearing on people in this town, takes forever to actually get comfortable around someone. 

in the past three years it seems like the only social situation where i felt like i belonged was when i went solo to a tiny niche concert - fairly certain i was the only student there.

i understand that this new technology brings challenges.  but as someone with adhd who bit off a bit more than she could chew this quarter, chatgpt has been an absolute godsend.  my side of the chat with the ai during class looks a bit like:  ""what is this term?  alright now explain at the high school level.""  ""give me a 100 word summary about this topic that the professor mentioned in the context of this other topic.""  ""write a nursery rhyme about this concept.""  ""take the topics i have been asking you about and present them back to me in the form of a data tree.""  ""i didn't understand your last answer, try reframing it.""  i feel like i have so much more control over my understanding of difficult concepts than i did before, and this gives me the opportunity to have difficult topics explained to me until i understand, no matter how long it takes.

so in case anyone reading has the ability to influence how the college uses ai:  like most tools, it can be misused, but it also can provide a lot of assistance in the classroom and in study sessions.",discussion

"phys 121: purchasing e text &amp; access code to mylab &amp; mastering (💀 why are there so many options…? i’m confused 💀)

so according to the [physics 12x website](https://phys.washington.edu/121-122-123-courses), there are five options to purchase the etext and/or the access code. the access duration for online learning system varies from 18 weeks to 18 months.

this information completely differs from the payment screen on pearson. 

there are three options on the payment screen:
- option a: with e-text access with access to mastering (18 weeks) - $74.99
- option b: with e-text access with access to mastering (up to 24 months (???) ) - $124.99
- option c: without e-text access (up to 24 months (???) ) but with access to mastering - $79.99

the “up to 24 months” confuses the hell out of me because the physics 12x series website says that the access duration is 18 months… (but i digress)

i plan on taking physics 121 in the spring quarter (which is now) and physics 122 in winter quarter 2024 (which is… later (lol) ).

essentially, would i be okay in buying option c when i have a pdf copy of the textbook? i’m confused because the options only say “access to mastering” so would this include mylab and mastering??? is access to mastering referring to the hw??? will i be okay without the etext? 

i just need the cheapest version for the longest amount of time possible that covers what i need to submit for the course—mylab and mastering, and the physics 12x website info (as linked above) is confusing the hell out of me.",academics

"participation oriented lecture classes that force you to talk to people are truly evil i'm in this class that's graded 80% on exams and 20% on in-class participation, which already feels fucking criminal. it's an absolute nightmare for me because 80% of my grade depends on my dog shit memory, and the other 20% requires me to answer polleverywhere questions correctly (which also sucks because the internet connection has been terrible for me recently and my cell service doesn't reach the lecture hall well, so if the wifi is acting up, i just miss the question). the real issue for me is that over and over again throughout the class, we're supposed to be discussing concepts with our neighbors. i understand my professors point that it helps us to understand the content more, but as an autistic person with severe social anxiety, it feels like an exercise in public humiliation.

talking to strangers makes me feel uncomfortable, but at uw, it's extra bad. at least in my classes, i notice things are extremely homogenous, and i tend to stand out a little because i dress pretty differently from the vast majority of people around me. it already puts me on edge when i turn to talk to the person next to me and they look at me like i'm a fucking alien, so the anxiety of potentially saying the wrong thing/answer is really intense. however, if i don't talk to anyone, then one of the ""peer facilitators"" will come up to do the discussion with me. it feels really embarrassing to have tas step in because i have nobody to talk to, and just makes everything worse. i know they're just trying to be helpful and have good intentions, but after it happened to me a couple times today, i started crying. if it were up to me, i'd never go to the class and just watch panopto recordings, but because of the grading and the fact that i don't feel confident about my future exam scores, i have to go regardless.

i'm mostly just here to rant because i'm frustrated, but also would love to know if anyone else hates this sort of class so i can perhaps feel less embarrassed about how stressful it is for me.",rant

"udub undeclared vs umd cs i am an international student who needs help deciding between the two colleges.

i'll be applying for informatics at udub [since it aligns with my career goals]. i have talked to a couple of udub students who say that it's not that hard to get the major. however, there's always a risk, right?

uw is the better-ranked college + seattle seems to have more internship and job opportunities however it's really hard to give up a great offer by umd which guarantees me a major l'm interested in.

uw seattle would be around 8k usd more than umd but the cost is no barrier.

"honest uwb to uws chances. 
hey guys,

ik there are already a few posts abt transferring from uw bothell to seattle. but i just wanted some input from y’all.

so a lil background: im currently a freshman at uwb(sophomore credit-wise), and am currently working towards completing my prereqs for computer engineering. im really interested in informatics at seattle, specifically the data science stream. this is because of a couple of reasons: 
1. ive taken a couple of data science courses(outside school) that have rlly interested me in the field. i also plan on doing some small projects in the mere future.
2. the campus and college life, or rather the absence of it at uwb.
3. ive just started taking a class at seattle(cross-campus) and i love it✅

by the time i apply (sep 2023) my gpa should be around a 3.75 and i would about 70ish credits as im also taking summer classes. i kinda am already done with info prereqs too.

please lmk what y’all think abt my honest chances of transferring 👍, and if y’all have suggestions.",admissions

"graduation date error - need help fellow impending graduates, i need y'all's help. turns out that uw has been telling the national student clearinghouse the wrong estimated graduation date for almost a year now. normally this isn't a big deal, but i applied to a master's program that needs a provisional certificate of graduation (i.e. a certificate of enrollment showing my graduation date). i didn't notice the error, because why would my estimated graduation date be incorrect if i've already applied to graduate? except now i have until the morning of the 12th to fix the problem.

i asked my roommate and a friend, and it turns out that their estimated graduation date on nsc is also wrong.

can y'all do me a huge favor and check if yours is also incorrect? i'm trying to get some data on whether or not this is a more widespread error.

"college decisions! hi, i recently got accepted to both uw and ucsd as a freshman applicant. 

i got accepted for pre-sciences with the intent to major in biology my junior year. at ucsd i got accepted for molecular and cell biology at marshall.

i’m really conflicted on which to choose. they both are pretty much equal ranking-wise for pre-med research and opportunities. uw would be instate but has very intense weed-out classes i don’t think i would pass with a high grade in. ucsd would require more money but i can transfer my previous community college classes without them hurting my uc gpa. i’ve heard that med schools take high gpa as a major factor so this would be great.

socially, i know a lot more people at uw and  love the city/campus. i do want to branch out and leave home though so ucsd would be a great option for that, especially with the weather and gorgeous campus. i really don’t know what to choose so any insight on research opportunities, relative competitiveness, and academics would be appreciated! thank you",advice

"can students transfer in outside credit courses and apply for majors?   hello, dear uw students. i am an incoming first-year student. i heard that there are only two ways for people to get credits for the prerequisite courses and use them to apply for majors. for the first method, we must take prerequisite courses for acms and cs, such as cse 123 or cse 1xx inside of uw. or we can also choose to transfer ap credits in and use them to apply for cs and acms. 

  is it so? so students are forbidden to transfer cse 123 credits from other universities and then apply for cs and acms majors? has anybody experienced this? i have taken intro to computer science at another university and it would be nicer to just transfer it in and use it to apply for cs or acms major. is this forbidden at uw?",academics

"my personal ave foods tier list happy to see some discussion over food on the ave, i've kept track of every meal i had on the ave in the past three years. the reason seattle has no michelin star restaurants is because there hasn't been a pnw michelin guide, so there hasn't been an opportunity for any places to earn a star. also, i use aladdin's as the dividing line between a-tier and b-tier. i usually end up changing what i think of a place when i try more of their menu, so if there i particular dishes i have missed/should try, please let me know!  


a tier:

ygf malatang

i used to think i wasn't a soup guy, but a bowl of this on a cold, rainy day is one of my favorite meals in seattle. i basically got a little bit of every option the first time, which ended up being pretty expensive, but still delicious. haven't tried all the seafood, but in general i liked everything but the various meatballs/sausage. highly recommend the gourd, tiny mushrooms, and the greens that look like chrysanthemum leaves for things i wasn't sure i'd like and ended up loving.

chili's south indian

lamb chettinadu curry: very good chicken, perfectly tender, perfectly spicy. very flavorful. portions were a little small, especially for the price. had the chicken version later with a friend, also delicious

malabar chicken curry: had more veggies than the chettinadu curry, which i liked. also delicious.

the alley

spicy pork skillet: everything was delicious, a lot of good sides. second best value in a meal besides saigon deli, but i think the price went up since the first time i've been there

bugis

hot spicy chicken bowl: delicious. salad with good dressing, teriyaki chicken, rice, pickled onion, boiled egg. fairly small portion of chicken and rice, salad was simple but very good. whole dish came together great.

vegetarian tofu bowl (spicy, noodles): pretty good, the second-best vegetarian meal i've had on campus. pretty standard egg noodle in spicy teriyaki sauce with broccoli and carrots. outside of the tofu was really good, what really brought down the dish was that the broccoli, tofu, and sliced boiled egg were cold. you can solve this by letting the dish sit for a little, but it's still off-putting.

mama's viet kitchen

seitan lemongrass: the greatest vegan dish i've ever had. when the dish came out, i was initially hesitant, as i don't usually eat vegetarian, and i like having a good amount of meat to go with my veggies. as it got closer, the smell hit me, and it was absolutely incredible. the vegetables also looked pretty great up close. on tasting them, they were perfectly, truly perfectly, seasoned and cooked. the only request i would make would be to serve the veggies right on top of the rice, so the rice has more time to soak up the flavor.

chimac

assorted wings: quality of the meat was really high, sauces weren't that good, dry rub was way better. skip the corn. pride chicken is delicious, chicken tenders are good, snow wings are a really good dry rub

cedar's

naan was pretty good, samosas were really good, lots of filling. chicken was very tender.

village sushi

sushi regular: good variety, it was all delicious. the wasabi was very good.

shultzy's

french dip cheesesteak: coleslaw was vinegary, fries were very thin, which was good but hard to eat non-messily with ketchup. excellent meat quality and quantity, perfectly balanced with onion and swiss cheese, bread and au jus was great, they only give you half a roll which wasn't great for the price.

jai thai uw

crispy garlic chicken: delicious. chicken was very good, perfectly crunchy, saucy without being soggy. vegetables were perfectly cooked, the carrots, broccoli, and other greens were delicious. the entire dish came together fantastically.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

b tier:

aladdin gyro-cery

aladdin veggie roll: not great. falafel was delicious, but the whole roll was a little dry and flavorless. the baklava was large, and pretty good.

aladdin's special gyro(lamb and beef): very good, a bit less greasy and more salad-y than sultan gyro grill, could be a plus or minus depending on the person. ratio of meat to sauce to pita to greens was perfect, meat was tender and salty, garlic sauce was very good.

falafel sandwich: surprisingly little falafel, incredibly dry, not very saucy. basically a falafel salad sandwich.

kofta sandwich: not good, basically just a burger patty with tahini

aladdin fries(lamb): delicious, lamb was perfectly tender with a thin but excellent crunch around the outside. drink water with it or you'll mummify, maybe a few too many fries but some people love the fries so who knows

voula's offshore cafe

little squeaker sandwich and potato salad: very good, meat was a bit thin and not tender, but flavorful. bread was good, and soaked up the perfect sauciness. tomato went well with it, and i don't like tomatoes. potato salad was balanced between creamy and firm, i really liked the red onion in it.

country fried steak: eggs were good, hashbrowns were decent, english muffins were very good. gravy was alright, country fried steak was alright, a bit salty but it goes well with the egg and hashbrowns.

costa's

original eggs benedict: really good, i don't really like ham but it was still good, that's how good it was.

next to try: kotopita + galaktoboureko

ivar's walk-up salmon bar

chowder bowl, fried scallops, fried clams: pretty good greasy spoon fare, view out front isn't great, bridge is very loud

henry's taiwanese kitchen

three cup chicken: pretty good, rice in the sauce was delicious and the greens were good, but the chicken wasn't very tender. it was like a very sweet soy sauce, but not quite teriyaki.

pho shizzle

spicy chicken teriyaki: good size, chicken was a bit too crispy for me, flavor of the teriyaki wasn't great, could have had more salad. the side sauces were really good.

the alley

spicy pork bulgogi: pretty good overall, good presentation

byrek and baguette

ground beef byrek: meat pastry, blackened around the edges, cold by the time it was served.

roasted pork baguette: delicious, reminds me of un bien, maybe not quite as good but also a lot less messy, so easier to eat without feeling self conscious.

kai's thai street food

pad kra tiem: pretty good, not really very memorable though.

sultan gyro grill

kufta: alright. a little greasy and salty, hot sauce was good, great texture overall.

u:don

pretty greasy noodles, good prices on some items. not exactly fine dining, but still pleasant comfort food.

mee sum pastry

mongolian beef: solid beef + onion dish, very tender beef

sweet alchemy ice cream

sweet cream: i'm not an ice cream person, but it's the best vanilla ice cream i've ever had.

h-mart

only place i've found meiji chocolates, so it gets an honorary spot on the list

saint bread

saint burger and cookie: saint burger was a single patty, shredded lettuce, cheese, pickles, aioli. best buns i've ever had, perfectly toasty. excellent, simple burger.

been back with friends a few other times, i think the burger's the best thing i've had

&#x200b;

c tier:

saigon deli:

bbq pork sandwich: delicious bread, egg was a little runny. great ratios of ingredients, bbq pork wasn't noteable.

aladdin's burgers

beef and lamburgghini: decent smash burgers

little duck

beef fried rice, mushroom and chicken soup, hot and spicy chicken: soup was good, the rest wasn't great. lots of bone pieces in the soup, hot and spicy chicken is basically spicy chicken nuggets.

shawarma king

lamb shawarma sandwich, basbousa: delicious, kind of a lamb burrito, perfectly flavorful and saucy. basbousa was kinda gritty, but was also moist with a honey-sweet syrup, very good.

lamb salad: not very good, salad was cold and wet which cooled down the lamb, the lamb was not very tender

gyro sandwich: not good, nothing about it tasted great or really worked with any other ingredient

chocolate roll: not very chocolatey, more of a fig-newtony kind of roll. probably on the level of a nutrigrain bar.

agua verde cafe

chicken burrito: creamy, but the chicken wasn't very flavorful. small for the price.

chorizo breakfast burrito: the thermal temperature of this burrito was sufficient to plasmify the air around me for ten minutes. the burrito was cheesy and greasy, not bad, a bit heavy for breakfast.

a taste of xi'an

bean soup, hot oil pulled noodle: pretty good, was definitely something new. might try skewers next time

mr. bian dumplings

bian dumplings, pork and shrimp dumplings: a bit expensive for the volume. shrimp wasn't very flavorful, bian dumplings were better. overall kind of plain.

guanaco's pupuseria

pretty small, good variety of flavors

xi'an noodles

spicy pork noodles: service time was pretty long, presentation is pretty poor but the taste is pretty good. kind of felt like i could make it at home though.

bb's teriyaki

veggie stir fry, brown rice, spicy chicken, spicy sauce: decent portion size. a little greasy, generally forgettable. veggie stir fry was just wilted salad, skip.

mark's thai food box

pork ribs: not great. curry and rice wasn't very good, ribs were neither meaty nor tender. dish was a little cold overall, the egg was the best fried egg i'd ever had.

jewel of india

mixed grill, lamb samosas, chicken jalfrazie, gulab jamun: mixed grill and jalfrazie was alright, nothing special. samosas were really good, gulab jamun was too cardamom-y for my taste.

nasai teriyaki

spicy chicken: pretty basic chicken teriyaki. was made very quickly, which i like. a lot of people seem to really like it, maybe i got the wrong dish?

ate o'clock thai

hot spicy thai basil: not very spicy, veggies were alright but meat was fairly poor quality. not worth the price.

just burgers

tennessee w/ curly fries: a little overcooked, sauces were good and onion was delicious, but overall very greasy.

thanh vi

banh mi combo: short for a banh mi, the most generic banh mi i've ever eaten

araya's place

veggie cakes, kaeng ka-ri: good vegan food, and large portions, but incredibly expensive

dubpop asian fusion

general tao's chicken: not very good flavor on the sauce, pretty good serving size for the price.

chipotle

pollo asada: they'll give you too much rice and beans if you let them put both on. otherwise, pretty good burrito, anita's on aurora (and el camion) are way better

korean tofu house express

bibimbap: not a lot of meat, but sauce was good, so way rice + veggies. 

time bistro

garlic chicken and rocket shrimp wraps: bland, nothing special

samurai noodle

tonkatsu ramen: not great. salty/creamy isn't really my thing, the pickled veggie and pork weren't great, and the noodles were a little too squishy.

cedars of lebanon

marinated chicken sandwich: a little bland, kind of like a chicken salad sandwich.

panda noodles

veggie fried rice: a little heavy on the soy sauce, otherwise a standard bowl of fried rice.

little thai restaurant

clao cook gapi and fish cakes: fish cakes rather bland, not very crispy. egg was overcooked, maybe a bit too much rice for the beef, the portion was good overall but maybe not for the price. beef was pretty good, got the second-spiciest level and it wasn't very spicy. they do have a fish tank, which is a huge plus.

sushi burrito

dragon ball: criminally overpriced, even with the uw guide coupon. pretty good, and didn't skimp on the eel, the shrimp didn't really add anything.

samir's mediterranean

lamb gyro: spicy meat, a little bland on the whole",rant

"open letter to boba up employees i saw a poster on tuesday morning saying that bobaup employers were stealing employee tips. this poster has since been taken down and the original poster didn't have anything on it about how to get in contact with people or if there was any organizing to combat this practice. i just wanted to let those employees know that under washington state law:

* employers must pay all tips to employees.
* the employer may not take tips for company use, or to pay employee wages.
* “tip crediting” isn’t allowed. tips are **in addition to**, and not a part of, an employee’s state hourly minimum wage.

[https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges](https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges)

i know a lot of workers especially in the service industry worry that it is a losing battle when it comes to standing up for their labor violations, so i wanted to link some resources to ways that employees can enforce their rights:

1. you can get free legal council about your situation with the king county bar association. this will probably be low on the priority list, but they will get to you and it is free. i did this myself about a workplace violation and while i have to hire an attorney for the actual lawsuit, it is good to have free legal council to see if proceeding with legal action is a good idea (link to free legal assistance [https://www.kcba.org/?pg=free-legal-assistance](https://www.kcba.org/?pg=free-legal-assistance) )
2. make sure to document as much as you can in writing. when you have a spoken conversation with your employer saying this stuff about your wages, email them a followup confirming what had been discussed in the meeting so you have a paper trail. often recording this is enough to scare them straight
3. talk to your coworkers about your situation and see if you can form a united front. employers talk a lot about how your labor is replaceable, but honestly it is costly to fire a bunch of people legally, let alone illegally, and then hire a bunch of new inexperienced people. there are ways that you can organize in order to collectively bargain for good treatment. just because a company is a small business that does not mean that you should accept unethical and illegal treatment from your employer.",psa

"subleasing 3 individual bedrooms in u district apartment hey y'all! my 2 roommates and i are trying to sublease for the summer (starting now until end of september 2023), but you don't need a group of 3 people - just 1 person can sublease a single bedroom, 2 people can lease 2 bedrooms, etc. 

rent is $1349 per person per month, which includes all utilities (sewer, garbage, water, electricity, internet). i'm personally willing to negotiate the rent price if you want to rent out a single bedroom, so message me and we can talk about figuring out something that works! the complex also has study rooms, a gym, a sauna, and a rooftop deck with mini-kitchen and grills, all of which are included amenities. the apartment is on brooklyn and 50th; the walk time to the burke edge of campus is 5-10 minutes, depending on how fast you walk.

i will say - the apartment complex is here seattle, which, if you've heard anything about, is rather notorious for its shitty management. having lived here for about a year, i'll say that most of the general qualms with the complex aren't actually about the apartment (which, to be honest, is pretty damn nice), but more about the management's delay of the apartment opening (our move-in was delayed by, like, 3 months). so, if you're subleasing, you don't have to deal with any of that shit, and you just get to move into the apartment on time like a normal person lol. also, to be so honest, management right now is pretty chill. i think most of the front desk workers are uw students, and they never check on your apartment. so, not bad. the apartment itself is very nice (our kitchen has massive counterspace lol).

anyways, message me if you're interested and/or want pictures! like i said, i'm personally willing to negotiate the rent price, because frankly, paying less on my rent in an apartment i won't be in over the summer is better than paying the full rent. also willing to tour for those in the area, or record a video tour for interested parties, so just lmk!",student life

"someone should make ratemyprofessor but for academic advisors/counselors i just had the most pointless appointment ever with my program's interim (because we don't have anyone full-time yet) academic advisor -- i didn't really get any of my questions answered and was told some contradictory things *within the appointment itself*.

some bored cs major should make a site to review advising, especially somewhere like uw where advisors are a designated staff member rather than faculty. 

this can be made so that students can both give feedback on good advisors (the advisor we had at the start of the year in mlis was awesome) and tell people they'd be better off self-planning if there's an advisor who's not that good.",rant
"""uw students, make me hate uw"" post follow up [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/139yma9/uw_students_make_me_hate_uw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to read my last post. this is for any prospective uw cs students that are either waitlisted or accepted to pre-science and having a hard time deciding between uw and your local cc.

hi guys! it has been a month since i last posted here, and i was overwhelmed by the personal experience, support, and advices i got from current uw students. you guys were all brutally honest about your experience, and i just want to say thank you, i genuinely appreciate each and every comment on that post.

today, saturday, may 27th, 2023, i have decided to decline uw pre-science offer and committed to my local community college, and will test my luck again with the uw cs transfer admission cycle.

as a lot of you have said, the true ""college experience"" is what you make it to be. i might be missing out on the ""traditional college experience"", the freshmen dorming experience, the parties, the late night studies at odegaard, the walks with friends on uw red square, etc, but i'm sure that i will gain a lot of meaningful experience at my local cc!

for the anxious high school students that are reading this, there is no right or wrong option, college admission is random sometimes (i'm an instate student waitlisted by uw but accepted by ucla, ga tech, uiuc and just got off uc berkeley waitlist). don't be disheartened by setbacks or waitlists; sometimes, life has a way of working things out in unexpected ways.

as for now, uw is still at the top of my transfer list and i hope that my journey at the community college will be fruitful and lead me back to uw in the future.

good luck to all the prospective, current, and graduated uw students, and to anyone navigating the college admissions process. i hope my story can provide some guidance and reassurance to others facing a similar dilemma. may your journeys be filled with growth, learning, and success.",advice

"[paid research study!] adults needed for in-person speech studies happy summer!

we are a lab in the department of speech and hearing sciences here at uw and we're looking for adults to participate in some research studies.

in general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do not stutter for a variety of experiments in which you'll be compensated $20/hr. we can reimburse for street parking and we will provide you with a free hearing screening as part of the experiment.

most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words or sentences off a screen. some studies involve measuring your brain activity while you wear an electrode cap (just like a swim cap). we have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of covid-19.

if you are interested, or have any questions at all, please email us at [maxlab@uw.edu](mailto:maxlab@uw.edu). we will send you an eligibility questionnaire to determine if you qualify.

"math 124 or 125? i'm an incoming freshman in the college of engineering (engineering undeclared) and i plan to major in a&a. i did the ib diploma program and got credits for math 124. the ib required us to use a scientific graphing calculator (i used casio fx-cg50) but the math 124/125 website says that we can only use ti-30x iis for the course - a calculator i'm not very well acquainted with. it also says that it's recommended for students to retake the class, regardless of whether they have ap/ib credits. 

my question is - should i skip math 124? i took the math 124 placement test and scored 9/10 (which makes me qualified for the class) + i scored a 7 in math aa hl in ib. i also looked over the math 124 and 125 syllabus and i'd say i've covered around 90% of the stuff in high school (for both classes). although, i'm still a bit worried because 1) the calculator's different and i'm not sure how much of an emphasis is placed on its usage in the class, 2) they're both weed-out classes and i'm not sure if choosing math 125 without having studied 124 would be a good decision (especially in my first quarter), and 3) i'm planning on taking chem 142, engl 121, gen st 199/engr 101 along with math 124/125 and i want to maintain a high gpa for most classes since they're prerequisites for my intended major. 

would taking math 125 give me any sort of advantage when it comes to applying for a&a? would it be hard to cope with the same?

"psa: please be careful this creep on the bus (disclaimer: i'm not a uw student. also, please don't make racist / discriminatory comments. i mention the race / nationality of the man so people can watch out for him, not to incite hate towards any particular group.)

tl;dr please be careful of a man secretly taking photos of girls on the bus. he's asian, in his 60s, wearing glasses, short gray hair, around 5'8 and slightly overweight. he speaks chinese (southern accent) and was accompanied by his wife, asian woman also in her 60s.

context: my friend and i took the 32 bus from uw to queen anne today, there were a group of girls (presumably uw students) and this older couple on the bus with us. the girls were chatting and were not facing the man, but i sat right behind and could see him taking photos of the girls / their lower bodies on his phone.

at first i thought i was mistaken, but he kept taking photos over 10 minutes. every time he would try to cover his phone with one hand and lower it immediately whenever one of the girls turned around. after he took one more photo, my friend and i decided to confront him, i told him i saw everything and that he needs to delete those photos immediately or we're gonna call the cops. he was at a loss for words and put his phone away immediately, but i said that he would not be leaving until he showed the photos and deleted them. after some hesitation, he finally showed the photos and they were clearly images of the girls, and promptly deleted them. at this point the bus driver and everyone else had caught on to what happened, and the bus stopped at a stop. 

his wife started telling me in chinese that they are tourists and her husband was just trying to take a photo of the scenery outside (bullshit because 1. it was night time and the bus window was tinted, you could not see anything outside from his photos and 2. he was sitting by the window and all of the photos were pointed away from it), that it was not sexual and i was overreacting (one of the girls was crying and she had the nerve to say this). while she was talking, i kid you not, the man runs off the bus and leaves his wife behind. since the photos were deleted and there was limited evidence, we ended up not calling law enforcement, but i do regret not at least taking a photo of the man. we got him off the bus this time but there's no telling when he would try something like that again. that's partly why i'm making this post - please be aware of your surroundings, especially (unfortunately) if you're a young girl. and if you see something happening, please say something.

i apologize if this question is kinda dumb (i've been stressing that i might not get into my major) but is it smarter to finish my associates in community college (aka complete the three remaining humanities courses) or should i focus on taking harder math and science courses to show that i am a strong/competitive applicant? 

i applied for uw when i was a senior in high school two years ago and got in as a pre-sciences and now i have an underlying fear that i might not get into my intended majors for next fall. i currently have a 4.0 gpa and tutor calculus, is there something i'm missing that might help my application?

"chem 452/453 questions hi all,

i am a biochem major who needs to take chem 452 and 453. i was signed up for the course with professor gary drobny, and he seems very charismatic and friendly. however, his lectures go at 100mph and are hard to follow even though i am confident in my calculus abilities and read the slides beforehand. i also felt as though the topics do not apply to biochemistry as much as i hoped, and it feels just like a more advanced physics course (pistons, springs, etc). we were supposed to have our first quiz this friday, and we have not gone over any problems in lecture and the homework is very tedious. because of this and my 17 (science) credit workload and financial aid discrepancies, i ended up dropping the class to take it at a later time. my questions are as follows: who is the best professor to take this course with? i would not mind taking professor drobny again if needed, but i am open to other suggestions. also, is the 452/453 a/b summer option a doable thing? i have heard people mention the final (especially drobny's) is particularly brutal in that sequence. not looking forward to taking the series at all, but i understand it is inevitable.

tl,dr: who is the best professor to take for chem 452/453 and when should i take them?

"sickness confession just to dawgpile on current events...

fall quarter of my senior year there was a raging outbreak of swine flu (h1n1) - i, along with many others who gathered in my apartment to play a rousing game of edward 40 hands on a friday night, contracted flu-like symptoms the following monday. it had terrible symptoms - one of my friends had crazy fever dreams about walking sticks: making walking sticks, using walking sticks, walking sticks making & using walking sticks - real sick stuff. another one of my friends slept 30+ hours straight on our couch and woke-up feeling completely fine. i mostly stayed home from campus and experienced the oddity that is to-go pho for the first time (you mean i just put this raw meat in this rapidly cooling broth‽)

but i must confess, i did break the self-imposed weeklong ""quarantine"". i was taking chem 142 to get the remaining 5 lab science credits i needed to complete my degree (and it was the first year they ""dumbed"" it down to stop crushing so many pre=med hopes & dreams). i decided to go to the lab and just work in the corner by myself away from everyone else (it was the late aughts, nobody wore masks when they were symptomatic back then, not even the asians). i went home afterward and crashed hard, woke-up at like 3am and started doing my post-lab report. i correctly circled the point of diminishing returns but used the wrong value from the x-axis in my calculations so my margin of error ended-up being massive. when answering the question of what contributed the most to my error, i answered, ""swine flu"". the ta tore me a new one when she returned our lab reports (this was pre-online submission) and said she should've docked me more than the 5 points she did for the simple mistake. i just didn't want to have to deal with the crazy lab make-up process in december when i would've rather been snowboarding.

so please, i beg you fellow alumni, forgive me for not staying home like i should've. and also fellow alumni who were freshmen back then, forgive me for absolutely wrecking the curve and ruining your pre-med dreams. who knew you could teach yourself titrations on the back page of the final exam with only a working knowledge of calculus and a formula sheet (and still have time to enjoy an entire man can of rainier in a brown bag while checking your work)?",meme

"i'm tired of the fetishization of engineering majors the females on this campus are out of control. the first time i ate lunch wearing my uw engineering shirt i had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like i would know how to talk to a girl. i quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 2 months and i am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. i've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables i sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last weekly cse 123 programming ""project"". girl, i don't struggle with projects that are just homework. i'm an ece major, not cs. after making it markedly clear that i did not in fact want to copulate against the bookshelves of suzzallo, she finally left me alone, but i wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because i am enrolled in the hardest program on campus.

the worst are when students from non-technical majors talk to me. we'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: ""what's your major?"" as soon as i say my magnificent degree, i see their whole demeanor change. the doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. what makes a econ major think they have a chance with me. engineering and something practically liberal arts are on whole different planes of existence. i'm not about to impregnate somebody that does drop shipping for ""work.""

you may think i'm just remarkably handsome, which i am, but my attractive acquaintances in “hcde"" (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures with their ‘girl themed parties’. females see me as an object and a genius, when really i'm so much more: i'm top 100 in war thunder. my engineering shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch star wars with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout ""luke - i am your father!"" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic moment in star wars: episode v – the empire strikes back. not that i cried.

if you want somebody for cheap sex, the informatics majors are right there (i don't blame you for avoiding those who couldn't even get into cs though). stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. i didn't want to be born a super genius. hell, sometimes i wish i was an info major, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. but i have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next nuclear powered, hypersonic airplane spaceship (a continuance of daddy william e. boeing's legacy, obviously). seductively touching my raincoat isn't going to make me want to get with you. come back in a 787 costume, solve the three body problem, or solve a problem without assuming incompressible, subsonic, laminar, steady, constant everything, and then we'll talk.",meme

this person i am referring to wasn't even getting the call quietly, nor calling it for short time. he was literally just calling (not even whispering or sth) and responding someone very casually in the quiet space. (not in the 2nd floor or 1st floor) does some people not know that they can open the door and go outside? cus they are free to talk and call outside of the quiet study space. just go outside! it is that simple. 
3. **vaping**: what more can i say? if there are bunch of people studying indoor in a quiet space, it is absolutely a common sense that you shouldn't vape and chit chat with your friends. i saw a fucking smoke and i thought it was a fire or sth. turns out someone was just vaping in the quiet study place. why the hell would you even want to vape in the library smelling all fruity and stuff. go outside cus some people absolutely hate the smell of the vape or vaping in public in general.

reminder: this all happened not in general odegaard library. it happened in the 3rd floor of the library inside the quiet place, where (as the name says) has to be quiet and is made for studying! if you need to chit chat, talk, or vape just go outside of this study room. it is that simple!

i cannot believe i had to address these basic absolutely fucking basic common sense (not even an etiquette). i feel like i am 2nd grade teacher or sth. if you think i am talking about you guys, shame on you and please... please!! don't hinder other people's studying in a literal quiet study space.

"your thoughts on urinals in all-gender restrooms? right outside the classrooms in the basement of the art building, there’s an all-gender restroom that has an exposed urinal next to the sink. certainly not a common setup on campus. it doesn’t bother me and most of my classmates seem okay with it. based on my experience, people of all genders are able to behave like adults while using it and just go about their business without bothering anyone else (though i don’t know to what extent there’s a self-selection bias in terms of who’ll use this bathroom).

what are your thoughts? if you’ve used this restroom (or any other one like it on campus???), how was your experience? and if you haven’t, would you use it when there might be someone of another gender in there with you? and would people support/feel comfortable if this kind of bathroom situation became more common across campus—like if buildings without existing single-use gender neutral bathrooms had **some** of their gendered ones degendered for inclusivity?",discussion

"mental health support? hello, i'm wanting to get some mental health support on campus. i'm an international student, and i feel my mental health is deteriorating due to sleeplessness, homesickness and maybe some other factors (but not grades, seasonal depression, breakup etc.). i don't have depression, at least it was never diagnosed, but i feel i have paranoia and the tendency to overthink everything (if that counts as mental issues).

i also don't want my parents to know, they're textbook ""asian parents"" who don't care about mental health so i want a free service that doesn't require my life wise insurance (may send an email which could be picked up by my parents).

my finals are coming up soon like everybody else and i'm worried my sudden decline in mental health will negatively affect my grades (which are 90%+ as of now) so i kind of want to see someone soon... i'm also not comfortable talking online as i don't have anywhere private to go and i personally prefer talking face to face although i've never seen a counselor or mental health specialist or anyone similar.",advice
"thoughts on this school as a whole? i'm looking into going straight into a master's program after my undergraduate and seeking general opinions on uw. 

i currently go to worcester polytechnic institute in worcester, massachusetts for computer science and want to start focusing on ui/ux instead of software engineering. i'm from the midwest, and would ideally like to go somewhere on the west coast for a masters, though i'm more interested in going to somewhere with good academics. 

that being said, both the master of human-computer interaction and design (mhcid) and the m.s. in human-centered design & engineering (hcde) rank very highly and i plan to apply to hcde. though i want to make sure this school is worth it for me. 

wpi has decent academics, though i feel the vibes on campus are not the best, the people are very similar, and the school doesn't offer enough events that students are actually interested in. 

as much as i'd like to listen to the marketing team at uw, i work with the marketing team here already and i know how much bullshit there can be on their socials. so i want to get some opinions from actual students. i put a couple of general questions i'm looking for here but if you have any insight you'd like to share, anything to help me form a solid opinion on how students view the school.

"re: are you ""actively"" thinking in your daily life? i made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1877yl8/are_you_actively_thinking_in_your_daily_life/) a few days ago asking people if they are actively thinking in their daily lives. i received a variety of responses from people and upon reflection i do not think i was clear in what i was asking, which caused some people to question the sincerity of my post. 

obviously everyone ""thinks"" and people have thoughts going through their head constantly at varying rates. asking people if they are ""thinking"" was not the best way to start this discussion, and i can see how some people may have viewed that post in a negative light.

i have spent the last few weeks reflecting on my time at uw, and while i am grateful for the opportunities, connections, and friendships i have made here, i also have feelings of dissatisfaction. i got into a good program, which lead to good opportunities that i can pursue post-grad and i have made friends that i hope to stay in touch with into the future, but i feel as though i haven't developed as a person/adult as much as i would have liked during my time in college.

i expected going into a good university like uw that i would be able to engage with people that are passionate about a variety of topics, and can learn from their unique perspectives on the world. i feel as though i haven't really gotten to do any of that. granted, a significant portion of that time was during lock down, but we have been in person for couple of years now and after taking a variety of courses in person i can say that all of them have been pretty disappointing.

i think my disappointment is a result of a lack of engagement in any course. the discussion-based classes are difficult to get through as no one seems to want to engage in any of the content or participate in course dialogue. it becomes difficult to care about the content when it seems like none of your peers care at all. professors will ask questions to try to spark conversations and no one seems to want to answer unless they are specifically called on. when i try to cold approach people to discuss stuff in class i get one-word responses or just blank stares with ""i don't know"", followed by scrolling on their phone or laptop for the rest of the discussion. 

i have tried to join clubs to meet people who want to talk about literally any topic. this hasn't been easy since many of the clubs listed in the rso directory are abandoned. i was told this was because many officers graduated during the pandemic and no one was there to step into their roles. i have joined many dead discord servers for rsos and at this point i have kinda stopped even trying.

these experiences caused me to make my previous post, as i was curious if people are so preoccupied with their own stuff that they don't have the interest/energy to engage in anything beyond their own bubble, including course content. i understand that my last post was definitely worded poorly and i could have explained myself better, but i also know i am not the only one who has had these experiences after talking with some friends about this issue. 

maybe i am looking into in too much, but i genuinely feel like my time at college was kinda wasted. i don't feel any different leaving as i did coming in, which is upsetting. i hear about people who were able to grow as a person during their time in college and i am envious of their experience. i'm not talking about the ""eat, pray, love"" type of self discovery journey where i ""find myself"". i am merely saying that aside from the technical skills i have gained in some courses, i feel as though i haven't really learned anything from college. can anyone else relate to this? was college a waste of time and money or is this all that college is supposed to be? if so i feel as though i may have been better off at a coding boot camp rather than spending 4 years here.",discussion

"disappointed with fish 340 / biol 340 experience - lorenz hauser - name and shame! as a junior, a poc, someone with financial struggles, and academically as someone who has taken very difficult classes, this ranks as one of the worst classes that i’ve taken at the uw and other students can agree with me. 

we had a very  challenging time in fish 340 / biol 340 under lorenz hauser's instruction, alongside tas bryan and marta. the course lacked organization, making it difficult to navigate. despite efforts to seek help, explanations often fell short. grading was not ideal across the board—receiving conflicting advice from tas and classmates online in feedbackfruits made it perplexing to discern what was needed for assignments. lab sessions were similarly confusing, with changing instructions creating difficulties in following along and performing experiments effectively. while the course material itself wasn't overly complex, the delivery and guidance were subpar, hindering the learning experience. there were instances during labs where seeking guidance resulted in no responses, “i can’t tell you the answer’ by the tas, leaving us feeling stranded rather than guided. the grading of exams seemed arbitrary, and the subjectivity of the graders left many of us anxious about our final grades. additionally, the use of chatgpt  by the tas during office hours, without solid expertise in genetics, added to the frustration. considering my experience, i'd suggest exploring alternative courses if possible. 

compilation student remarks: 

“grading was horrible in the class, they never told us what’s wrong. one ta would tell me that i wrote my discussion section fine and not to worry about it, while the other ta would tell me to rewrite the entire section (bryan mostly, with marta being the lenient grader, but this went back and forth depending on what i showed them on my laptop.) this experience was repeated during multiple office hours, with the tas giving me one piece of advice, the professor, and the somewhat terrible advice that students would give each other because things were graded on feedback fruits.”

“like for the first couple of labs as well—they were changing numbers during our session and it made things confusing for me to process, because like im listening tot them change instructions, then having to write it down, then i am needing to actually perform the experiment.”

“while the content itself wasn’t super challenging their instruction and way of delivering it made things very challenging.”

“during some of the labs, bryan would tell us that ‘he can’t give us the answer’ all we are doing is asking for some guidance and you’re replying with that… most likely they didn’t know the answers themselves either.”

“exams are also graded brutally, and we are all worried for our grade in the class after this final. we don’t know how it will be graded because the graders are very subjective. they want the answers in their own words and find an opportunity to take off points for everything. if they want us to practice critical thinking in this class then maybe they should practice what they preach.“ 

“they were not  knowledgable themselves, i realized this after attending their office hours, they use chatgpt to answer the questions and really need to take a course on genetics before teaching it. they are on the whole very poor teachers.“

uw cse 123 vs 143 as someone who took 142 hi! i took the 142 course and 121 at  my local community college last year! since coming to uw i haven’t taken a cs course however i registered for 123 now this quarter. it’s the first day of syllabus and i’m not to confident about it especially since the professor said we should be proficient in so many things i just generally don’t remember since i haven’t coded in a while. i’m taking another stem course aswell and i don’t know if this is a smart move. do you think i should continue with 123 or wait for 143 next quarter (heard it’s the last offering). i can’t take 122 due to already completing the equalivent and it will mess up my aid. i also need to pass the course but i’m not sure if i can with 123 but i was hoping to get my cs course out of the way! thanks,academics

in general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do not stutter for a variety of experiments in which you'll be compensated $20/hr. we can reimburse for street parking and we will provide you with a free hearing screening as part of the experiment.

most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words or sentences off a screen. some studies involve measuring your brain function while you wear an electrode cap (just like a swim cap). we have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of covid-19.

if you are interested, or have any questions at all, please email us at [maxlab@uw.edu](mailto:maxlab@uw.edu)!

"psa for admitted first years about majors congratulations all incoming huskies! 

every year there is some confusion about majors and applying to uw, and i’m seeing some of that here, so i hope this can clear some things up.

when you applied for uw and selected your intended major, if you are admitted that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re actually in the major. only a select number of majors have the potential for incoming first years to be directly admitted, and those are listed at the attached link. most majors at uw do not allow for direct admit, so if you selected any of those majors on your application as your intended major and were admitted, you were admitted to uw as major undeclared, and may be noted as “pre-major”, “pre-sciences”, “pre-health”, or “pre-art” in your portal, all of these mean you don’t have a major.

psychology for example does not have direct admit, so if you selected psychology and were admitted, you are not actually in the psychology major. you would need to look up psychology’s pre-requisites, complete those courses, and apply once you’re here. some majors are selective and competitive to get into, some only have minimum requirements that as long as you complete those you’re admitted, and some majors are open, meaning there are no pre-reqs and you can declare at any time.

please just be aware during your planning for your first year that there are some steps you may need to take in order to actually get into your major, and plan to take those pre-reqs as soon as possible. uw is different than other schools that will typically admit you into your major when you’re admitted to the school, but uw more often than not will admit only to the school and not directly to any major. 

i hope this clears some things up!

"how hard is it to get into the college of engineering after being a freshman? hi everyone, i applied for cs which was a huge regret because later i realized that engineering was more my route. so i didn't get admitted to cs but instead got in as a pre-science major. so now i have to apply for the college of engineering. i want to do ce but since it's super competitive i decided i wanted to do electrical engineering. i got pretty much all my prereqs done besides 2 java classes before i could apply for the college of engineering. i'm not trying to apply to the paul allen school but just to uw college of engineering and then apply for ece. my brother and his friend think i have a good chance of getting in since i got a lot of my prereqs done but i'm a bit iffy since i only have a 3.7 gpa in the running start and it might drop more.

"is my final grade fair? there were two exams. the first one i got 12% above the class average, the second 10% above the class average. all the other grade categories i had 100% in. the class average grade was a 3.4. i got a 3.7. i feel like i should have gotten at least a 3.8 or a 3.9. do you think this is fair? i know a 3.7 is still a good grade but i just can't help but feel that i was cheated out of a better grade. thanks.

"admission confusion so i got admitted to uw seattle, but i’m a bit confused about my major. i requested a mathematics major, but was assigned a pre sciences major. i’m confused if this means that i can still do math, or if this means that i have to choose a back up.

for context, i’m a running start student. so i’ll be transferring over with an associate’s degree, but i had to apply as freshman due to the fact that i technically hadn’t graduated hs yet. so i’m not sure if that could’ve affected my assigned major. also, i’ve gotten into other schools for math. so if this does mean i can’t do math at uw, it’s not the end of the world.

"are the weed out classes really that insane? just looking for some insight here. i was accepted and as a prospective applied physics major, i’ve heard a lot about the weed out classes at uw. specifically the intro calc and physics sequences. people have gone as far to say it’s not even worth going to uw if you need to take weed outs for your major, and to just go to community college.

are they really as bad as their reputation/online discourse makes them seem? any tips for preparation or succeeding in these classes?",academics

do you love books? do you love flexing your book knowledge on others? 

rain city book bowl is a joint collaboration between head in the clouds trivia and quizbowl at the university of washington. our goal is to connect book nerds in seattle by giving them a fun competitive outlet! this league will recur monthly in bookstores around the seattle area.

our trial run will be held at the hub on uw campus. you can expect the event to be a hybrid of head in the clouds bar trivia and quizbowl. if you're unfamiliar with either or both of these question styles, no worries! we'll be explaining everything during the event, and i can answer questions in the comments of this post :)

team size is capped at 4. no teammates? no problem! when you buy your tickets, you can also request to be placed on a team with other players. we hope that this will be a fun way to meet other seattle readers!

we will be testing your knowledge of both old and new books, so our event will have an equal amount of questions about each. the genres covered will vary, but you can expect to be asked about classic books, sci-fi / fantasy, romance, poetry, and biography / nonfiction.

for more information, follow us on instagram: raincitybookbowl. we hope to see you there!

"why the fascination with ivys over cs at udub until the cs rankings on usnews and other sites are totally messed up, the way i look at  is that besides mit, stanford, berkeley, cmu and uiuc, every other college is ranked lower for cs. and looking beyond the rankings, i see so many other tangible advantages that aren’t taking into account in the rankings, like just udub’s proximity to all the amazing companies in seattle - amazon, meta, google, the endowments from pauly boy and billyg, the guest lectures form distinguished scientists from amazon, google, microsoft and others, the wealth of nearby companies to intern at who don’t have to pay for your accommodation in this tight market, the startup scene, and the constantly rising bar of incoming cs freshman, mostly gene-gifted kids of the sea of software engineer parents in the puget sound and beyond. i think udub cs has an amazing future.

yet i see this intense fascination with the lesser ranked ivies and non-ivies. are these folks mere brand name chasers who want bragging rights personally and/or have been condition to think that way by their helicopter parents, or am i missing something else. so they not know about the cs ranking? have they just given up on udub as out of staters given its heavy presence for instaters? i could see the argument that this high up in the rankings, the specific order doesn’t matter as much, and all else being equal maybe a brand could open some doors. thoughts?",discussion

"uw seattle vs purdue hey everyone, was accepted into uw for fall 2024. i received the pre major in the college of arts and sciences instead of business at foster. i understand how difficult it is to get into foster da but just wanted to know the difficulty to get in standard admission and what is generally required for this. 

at the same time at purdue i am admitted into the business analytics major upper division which intrigues me. initially i always wanted to go to uw but now i’m in two minds. 

as an international student i am more interested in the college experience and academics i’ll receive from both universities. 

which one would be better for business and university experience wise? 

any opinions and advice as to how to get in through standard admission, the difficulties alongside standard admission and what option would suit my current situation will be greatly appreciated as i’m hoping to make a decision between the two regardless of the cost of the universities.

"math credit waived for taking higher level class? i’m in a really dumb situation that i put myself in and i so desperately need guidance or advice. i had math 125/126 credit from running start, and throughout college i took math 207/207/224 for my degree. note …. i did not have math 124 credit because of some technicalities. i (stupidly) assumed that eventually i could get it waived somehow, so i put off even dealing with the credit until now as a senior.

last quarter i went to my advisors and asked for waiver, and while they seemed somewhat hopeful that it would get waived they eventually got back to me and informed me that it isn’t able to be waived. and not only that, i’m not eligible to take the course for credit at uw because the math department has a rule about taking a lower-level class for credit … so my only option would have been to take it at a community college or to take a higher level course (either math 209, or upper level amath course, etc) for substitution. i tried looking into a local community college but that would have been ~$1000 i would have had to pay out of pocket for, which i can’t afford, so i tried sucking it up and taking one of the amath courses this quarter.

it’s just not going well for me. the course is so difficult and beyond my understanding or interest. i go to class, and i review the notes but a single problem takes me 1-2 hours just to create a gameplan and understand what to do. my professor’s office hours was full with almost a third of the class there too, and others have made comments about our first homework’s difficulty. i’m also just going through so much in life right now, like i just broke up with my long-term partner of 4 years and now i have to go through the process of moving back home. other stuff also going on in my life but honestly the breakup is the one hitting pretty hard. 

i thought i could just deal with this but to be honest i can’t. this is really difficult for me. maybe i’m being entitled but i was shocked that the solution was to take a significantly higher-level course for credit that i otherwise wouldn’t have been expected to take. 

has anyone ever been in a situation like this before? does anyone have advice? i was thinking of going to the math department’s advising hours tomorrow and asking them directly for help since i haven’t done that yet. i knownit’s such a dumb situation i did to myself, and i need to deal with the consequences, but i’m feeling so hopeless because i don’t think i can do this.",advice
