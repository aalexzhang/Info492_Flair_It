"revised study advice **foreword:**

because some people have contacted me privately and legitimately thought my advice was helpful i am putting a toned down version here. i will elaborate more in the comment section.


**grading system:**

for curved classes, the median grade will be fixed to a certain gpa. for most weed out courses this will be in the 2.8 to 3.1 range. in a class of 200 about 4-6 people will receive a 4.0, 6-8 a 3.9, and so on up to about 20-25 receiving a gpa in the 3.5 range. this means to get a 3.5+ gpa you will need to be in the top 30% of your class.


**maintaining focus:**

a common complaint is that students are spending lots of time studying but with no payoff. when you study you will need to achieve a point of focus. put away your distractions and stay put at a desk and when you take a break only do it to use the restroom or take a quick bite. refrain from doing activities that have the potential to distract you. i personally recommend staying at a desk for 4 hours at a time. two 2 hours sessions without getting up with a break in between should work as well. at first you will feel bored and will not be able to concentrate. that is normal. push through it, and eventually you will be able to ""zone out"" and study effectively.


**in regards to lectures, textbooks, and videos:**

for the weed out classes i personally think the textbook is all you really need. yes learning form a textbook can be hard and confusing that is all part of the process. as things become more complex, your textbook is going to become your main source of information so i think getting used to it is going to be of great benefit. as for lectures there's really no point in showing up unless you are going to actively follow along and take notes (preferably handwritten). and finally, i think people should use youtube videos cautiously as they can be a time consuming and passive way to learn that works out to be not as effective long term.


**what to study:**

a lot of people think that studying consists of reviewing notes and reading the textbook. while this is a good way to start, it really only gives a lay of the land. you will need to do what is called active learning in order to be able to tackle the wide range of problems professors will throw at you. i recommend forming a study group with regular meeting times so that everyone is held accountable. each person should create problems in the form of a scenario that uses a concept from the class. refrain from asking simple things like ""what is x"", but rather aim for ""something y is being affected by object z, why is that?"". the process of forming questions and discussing the answer with others i found to be highly effective.",academics

"should i stay at uw (neuro) i'm currently a sophomore (soon to be junior) majoring in biology, and i recently got accepted to ucsd as a transfer majoring in neurobiology. i also plan to minor in applied math (have taken 301 and am planning on taking 3 more classes), and chemistry (if possible). currently i have a 3.5 overall gpa, with a 3.3 average across the bio series, so i think my chances at the neuroscience major are somewhat slim. however, i have had a year's worth of research experience in a neuroscience lab, and i've been involved in some neuroscience related clubs for quite a while (i'm also president of a non-neuro/bio rso). is it worth staying at uw, considering i probably won't get into the neuroscience major? how much does the major (biology vs. neuroscience) matter for graduate school (what i'm leaning towards) and/or medical school (something i'm considering but am not entirely sure of)? i'd like to do something with neuroscience in graduate school, so that might be important.   


currently the factors that are keeping me staying are: i have leadership positions at uw, uw has better/more neuroscience related clubs for undergrads, i have another lab lined up at uw that's very undergrad friendly/good for my transition into independent research, i can have minor(s) at uw, and uw might be better for my gpa because i can take less classes/have a less intense schedule.   


the factors encouraging me to transfer are: tuition (i'm a ca resident), weather, major (neurobiology vs biology), and the fact that ucsd is super good for neuro.  


considering everything, is it worth staying? what would you do, or if you've been in this situation, what did you do?

"from cheating in cse 143 to a full time programming role **as i am seeing that many admission decisions are coming out i thought now would be a good time to share the (success) story of my journey at uw, which is coming to an end this quarter.**

  
like many hopefuls i came into the uw hoping to do computer science. i had built my own computer in high school, i thought coding was fascinating, i saw that it was a field that was employable and paid well. like many up until i started at uw i didn't really realize the work it took to be successful, and i wasn't prepared for the competitive nature that uw cultivates. 

by the end of **my first year** i knew i would never be a cs student. i took cse 143 that winter with my roommate, we were both struggling on an assignment and he sent me an ""example"" of a past quarter's submission found online. as i soon found out, you can change every single variable name and you will still get caught. the program they run is able to see the structure of the code and compares it to their database of submissions. that crushed me, and was one of the hardest lessons i had to learn my freshman year. having to own up to my own mistake and look past it shook my world for the better. we both got caught and i don't blame my roommate at all.

i was able to finish the prerequisite courses to informatics just in time to apply my freshman year. i wrote a piss-poor essay which i was revising with 10 minutes left to the deadline. in retrospect of course i'm not surprised at all that i wasn't admitted, but at the time i was still partially in the mindset that life would just work out for me. 

after getting rejected my **sophomore year** with an actually well written and revised essay i was heartbroken. in my head i still was set on info as my backup major and didn't have another backup, i didn't have the prerequisites or grades for acms or any math heavy major. a friend of mine had recommended gis in geography as a tech-related alternative and by the end of the year i was a declared geography major. i still wanted to program for a living and still was hoping to get into info my junior year. i had it calculated that i could take info classes on the side and still graduate in 4 years if i was admitted then.

so many students i see on this sub-reddit put an incredible emphasis on getting into their major. which is a great goal to work towards, but it isn't the ""end all be all""! i finally came to realize around this point that *my major wasn't what was going to get me that desired job after college, it was the skills was able to gain and retain from my studies*. this was when i got my first internship paying minimum wage at a research center downtown to help add data visualizations to their website. i got this through applying to nearly every data science related *undergraduate research program listing.*

for my **junior year** informatics essay i was actually so ticked at the system that my essay was about how my major and grades don't define my capabilities in life. haha! long story short i didn't get in then either, and was officially going to be graduating as a geography major. i continued to take informatics and the non-major cse courses that i was able to get into and began applying like crazy to internship roles for the next summer. i likely *applied to over 100 roles mostly on sites like glassdoor*. i got my second internship at a recreational equipment company working on their employee management system/database. around this time i also secured a part-time engineering internship at a telecommunications giant that would go throughout my senior school year. when i applied and accepted these internships my resume still had informatics as my intended major even though i was denied from the program a few weeks afterwards. 

this might apply to tech more than other majors but *don't think that because you didn't get into your major you aren't qualified or able to get that role you want or be successful in the future*. fight through it and apply everywhere! **work experience is so much more valuable than any major title or course.** 

the geography major is not incredibly technical and even though i'm seeing this data science option that has been recently added to it, after looking at the courses, it's not that much more intensive. geography courses all hold your hand through the material and if you do major in i highly recommend going above and beyond. i was able to take every single non-major cse course except for ai and the photography one. in informatics i was able to get the android, ios, and server-side courses (don't take professionalism), many people assumed i was in the major.

for a while i regretted not transferring when the geography major initially disappointed me, but in retrospect two factors made staying worth it, the reduced in-state tuition (probably saved over $50,000 in debt), and simply *the amount of opportunities in seattle*. all my internships were located in seattle and being able to be at school so close gave me the opportunities to go to interviews (of which i got rejected from many) and eventually find internships. 

this summer i start work full time as a diagnostics engineer writing programs that monitor and help to maintain cell phone service around the country, i get to work with massive amounts of data, and am making a 6 figure salary right out of college. to everyone who has been rejected from any major, know that it isn't the end of the world and you can and will bounce back. stay positive and fail forward.",advice

so i guess i have two questions:
1. how can i go about getting an add code for this course? i've attempted to contact the english department with no luck so far.
2. is this course offered every quarter? if so i wouldn't be worrying so much but i'm worried i screwed myself over by not taking it freshman year.

"""easy 4.0"" classes review - winter and spring 2020 i was thinking this would help you all with future class registrations. this school year i took a few of the suggested easy classes on our megathreads and i'm here to provide an updated review. this includes psych 101, ais 103, ais 270, and drama 215.  


**winter 2020:**  


**• (i&s, 5 cr) psych 101 w/ judith l. mclaughlin:** honestly, i loved every second of this class. mclaughlin is so sweet. she was always open to scheduling meetings outside of office hours if there was a time conflict with my classes. the tas also had office hours. in terms of grading, she graded based off of 3 online assignments (for completion), poll everywhere in-class questions (for completion), and 4 non-cumulative multiple-choice exams. i was also able to raise my grade up to a maximum of 0.3 gpa points by participating in psychology studies outside of class (as the test subject). for the workload, i spent around 2 hours studying and reviewing notes everyday and got a 4.0. i didn't find it necessary to read everything in the textbook; she provided a study guide for us to focus on specific concepts and sections. her exam questions gave a scenario and we needed to match it to a concept we learned in class. given this, we didn't need to do that much rote memorization since she gave similar scenarios in her lectures. unfortunately, i never fully paid attention (my own fault) so i just made quizlet sets to remember the concepts. you can find them here if you want to get a feel for the content: [https://quizlet.com/kpolful](https://quizlet.com/kpolful)  


overall, i wouldn't call it an ""easy 4.0"" since you need to put a good amount of effort in every week to get one. for perspective, she revealed the score spread after every test and only 30-40% of the class consistently got above 90%. however, it's definitely an easy 3.5+.  


**• (i&s & div, 5 cr) ais 103 w/ dian million:** imagine the coolest aunt you could ever ask for. that's dian. lectures consisted of dian telling stories about her inspiring indigenous origin and watching films. our work consisted of four ""quizzes"" that each had around 5 long answer questions (250-500 words each). they're based on 3-20 page readings she posts to canvas. why quizzes is in quotation marks is because we had 2 weeks to answer them. there was also an assignment for us to go to burke to research indigenous artifacts and a final art project to convey our emotions for a topic we learned during the quarter (graded on completion).  


""easy 4.0"" approved. although she's not teaching for fall quarter 2020, i'm sure any introductory ais class will be similar in workload.  


**spring 2020 (keep in mind the online format may have significantly affected the workload):**  


**• (i&s & div, 5 cr) ais 270 w/ charlotte cote:** imagine your other coolest aunt. that's charlotte. our work consists of interacting with two discussion boards and a final quiz. charlotte explicitly said she was planning on assigning two quizzes but kept it to one because of how much stress we're going through. bless her soul. in the discussion boards you have to write an answer to questions related to the lectures and readings (similar to ais 103) in around 500-600 words total. after that, you post a question and respond to three other classmates. we're getting an entire week to work on the final quiz so i assume it's also long answer.  


""easy 4.0"" approved (online)  


**• (vlpa, 5 cr) drama 215 w/ skip mercier:** this was never mentioned, but somebody should add this to the list of easy 4.0s. skip is passionate about set/costume design and always strives to pass on that passion to his students. did you know he worked on plays for alice in wonderland and finding nemo? seriously, cool guy. it seems this class is fairly new and shows up every spring quarter. every week we have a few assignments (1-3) that have us test and improve our skills with a new concept of theater design. some examples include drawing a building with the use of perspective and drawing our own rube goldberg machine. there's also a final group project. it's all graded on completion so...

i’m planning on signing up for some 300 level cs courses and i can’t sign up for them without uw approving my transfer credits first. do you think uw will transfer my credits before my a&o? do i have to get an add code? if so, how? any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",advice

"hfs change and financial aid i've been wondering about what i should do now regarding my financial aid amount. 
my aid covers quite a lot and when i moved out in spring i ended up getting a direct deposit of what would have been going to hfs, however this ended up being very beneficial to the situation i'm in. despite ""living with my parents"" i am jobless and paying for a share of our expenses as well. i'm wondering now that i have cancelled my hfs application for next year (due to my classes being made online) if i should try and get my aid lowered because technically it is set up for me not living with my parents. i already accepted the award a while ago, also if i were to do this i don't know how i would.",advice
"(incoming freshman) taking a gap quarter/year or delaying admissions i'm getting so much anxiety because i don't know what to do. i am a us citizen living abroad (basically an international student) and many of my other international school friends are planning to take a gap semester/year because of covid-19. one of my friends who will be attending uiuc said there was an option for delaying admissions.

i can't find any information for uw—there's only an option for withdrawal (then i'd have to reapply and go through the whole college admissions process again) or quarter-off (which is only available for students who were at uw during the preceding quarter). 

if gap quarter/year isn't an option at uw for newly admitted students, i'd have to go with remote learning... but the idea of remote learning is terrifying because i don't know how i'm going to learn entirely new content and prepare for exams without having other classmates to talk to and learning in complete isolation without knowing anyone from uw. 

i did send an email to uw's international admissions asking about these options, but i'm posting here to see if anyone has any additional information.",advice

"what should i do about math 124? i need math 124 because it's a pre-req for some classes for psych. i've heard how gruesome the intro math series is here at uw, and i've heard a bad horror story for 124 from my friend, so i decided to take advantage of the online format and take math 124 online at a community college.

well, i'm failing really bad right now. i got a 51/100 on the first test and my professor's had to give me so many accommodations already because i missed the first quiz and a discussion post. at this rate, i'd be lucky to get a 1.7. none of this is curved. the emails i get from the professor always sound so passive aggressive, and he doesn't sound like he trusts me very much because of how much he's had to go out of his way for me. i just feel... deflated.

i've been debating on dropping the class. the deadline to drop the class and get any sort of refund on tuition was the 13th, so if i drop, i lose about $600. i still haven't paid for webassign. the trial ended yesterday, so i can't even check my grades, and there's an assignment due tonight. if i drop, i won't have to pay for webassign. if i try to tough this out, i'll have to fork over for webassign and have to rush to finish the assignment today, while i might not even pass the class.

i asked a psych advisor today, and he said i can afford to wait until next summer to take calc again, which is great to hear. but i don't know how next summer will look for me. i may not even be in the country to take classes. and even then, i live kind of far away from any community colleges as it is, which means i'd have to find a place that offers online calc classes that are transferable to uw.

1. should i drop the class and try again later somehow at some other school or at uw? or should i tough it out?
2. is math 124 at uw really that bad?
3. are there any colleges that offer an online calc class that can transfer to uw?

"uw transition overwhelm and transfer shock— how do i cope and adjust? i just had my orientation today as a transfer student starting in autumn. i knew coming in that there are a lot of students, which i didn’t mind at all. but honestly, being online today with so many others in one laggy zoom room freaked me out because there were so many more people than i expected and was used to at my previous school. i legit felt like i was clicking open classes during registration and right after i clicked them they became full. i really need to graduate on time and i already feel like i’m so behind as a transfer, especially as a senior transfer... i really don’t want to get lost or behind on anything. i also do not know how rigorous the courses are here. i feel like i’m going in blind.

anyone have any tips to cope? is everyone here just insanely competitive and fast? will i have to peel my eyeballs everyday for every opportunity and to be able to get into the classes i need? will every meal have to be half a granola bar that i finish in 20 seconds before smashing my keyboard to (hopefully) get into a popular course? do people end up not graduating on time bc they couldn’t get into their necessary course on time? i was a top student at my previous university and have always been so from elementary to high school as well. but i am still lowkey scared. there’s just so. many. people. especially online! it was much more overwhelming than i initially imagined.. either way. i’m going to always give my best. and never give up.

i have been told that my college choice will impact me heavily over my next four years, but far more so later on in my life when i am in my mid-30s and 40s, and that i need to make my college decision with the mindset of an adult, leaving behind my teenage biases.

we're building a new feature that lets you listen to short snippets of wisdom and actionable advice, specific to your issues and challenges, from people who've stood where you're standing. you can think of it as 2-5 minute mini-podcasts for what you're going through today.

there is the option of finding a new major, however i already completed most of my general reqs for uw and the business school. this would mean giving up my dream of attending the business school and completing my bachelor’s degree by 2022.  

i can join an open major and try reapplying into the busines school, but i fear that i would not get in again. also, there is no open major i am exactly interested in. unless someone knows a certain open major that ties well with business.

"faq for astr 101, 150, and ess 102 these are some pretty popular classes people take for either nw or i&s credits. i've taken all three so i wanted to provide some helpful information that i've seen people ask now-and-then on this sub.

these questions apply to all three classes (or where otherwise stated):

* are there math/physics pre-reqs?

>no. you need no knowledge or understanding of physics whatsoever for any of the classes. you don't need anything more than knowing arithmetic. **all physics and math necessary to pass the course will be covered in class or in class materials.**

* how much time lecture/study/etc per week?

>for all of these classes, you should expect to forfeit a mere 6-8 hours of your time most weeks.

* asynchronous?

>yes to all, but ess 102 moves a little faster, so i wouldn't postpone the work too much

* lectures necessary?

>100%. these classes are completely covered in the lectures. don't worry thought. that doesn't mean your hands are going to fall off at the end of each lecture. the profs are very clear in what information you should be taking away.

* how good are these online?

>the astronomy department has had astr 101 and 150 online since 2015, so it's super streamlined already. ess 102 doesn't have that same history, but it already seems to have most of the kinks out of the system. either way, all of these courses are super lenient in helping you get the grade you want.

* what is the homework like? (ess 102)

>**weekly labs that take 15-30 minutes.** the labs appear to be really long at first glance because they typically have a lot of questions, but most of the questions are asking you to either regurgitate information from the lectures or are asking for information that proves you did some of the physics activities.  
>  
>note: normally the class would be taken in person and thus would have labs at the university; using tools provided by the university to demonstrate the physics covered in the lectures. i'm taking the class right now and would say they have done a good job at creating labs that require nothing more than your cell phone, a ruler, and access to internet.

* what is the homework like? (astr 101, 150)

>astr 101/150 both have weekly discussion questions (dq), which you basically find a article that relates to a prompt, and then write a few sentences summarizing the article you found. i found astr 101 dq's took on average less time than astr 150. 150 is a lot more technical than 101, so sometimes it took me like an hour or two just to find an article that was long enough to write about. **expect 10 minutes or more on the dq**.  
>  
>on top of that there are ""labs"". astr 101 labs are generally more interactive and involve using some pretty fun programs. in those labs you basically answer questions that proved you messed around with the programs. both astr 101 and 150 also involve questions that involve using equations learned in class and writing short answers that prove you understand how the math/physics works. **expect 10-30 minutes on the labs.**

* do i need to read the textbook? (astr 101, 150)

>no. you do not need to read the textbook to pass, however, i found the textbook especially helpful  for getting more information on topics that weren't quite clear to me.

* is the textbook free? (astr 101, 150)

>astr 101 textbook pdf should be provided on your class canvas page for free. paper copies are also available for purchase (relatively cheap too!). astr 150: iirc textbook wasn't free, but also wasn't necessary either. so...

* how do i get help with the class?

>not exactly an faq, but something i want to make clear to people who haven't taken any astronomy related courses:  
>  
>the professors and tas who are in or associated with the astronomy department are **super** nice and helpful. it's a niche department at the uw, but i think that makes these people some of the most eager to make sure you understand the material.

&#x200b;

**course content:**

* astronomy 101
   * great detail into all of the laws of physics behind gravity and planetary motion; different types of stars and galaxies; and the origins of the universe and star formation
   * also covers good amount of the history of astronomy, but it is not really tested on
   * vague on formation of planets
* astronomy 150
   * very brief and vague on all of the information covered in astr 101. could potentially be confusing for people who have no understanding of the laws of physics, but that being said, you really only need to know how to use the equations. also this material makes up a fraction of the course as a whole.
   * great detail into the formation of our planets; the different types of planets, their chemical makeup, and why they contain said materials; how to identity the age of a planet's surface.
* ess 102
   * the first half of the class is basically a crash course on astr 150. thus the laws of physics and more general concepts which were briefly covered in 150, are covered exponentially faster in ess 102. that being said, you can always get help from the ta's.
   * the second half of the course is geared towards preparing you for the final project. thus the topics shift towards orbital mechanics and planetary research missions.

&#x200b;

**tl;dr**

* astr 101 can be taken by anyone. super easy class that is all about understanding the concepts (as opposed to the math and physics).
* astr 150 can be a little more challenging. since the course is designed for people with no background to be able to take the course, some necessary material covered in astr 101 has to be covered rapidly in order to make time for the prime material of the class. both classes offer the same credit, so i would recommend taking 101 before 150 if you can or have little to no understanding of how the universe work.
* ess 102 involves material from both astr 101 and 150, but mostly 150. since ess 102 has to involve all of that information in addition to orbital mechanics and planetary missions (like probes and robots), the course can feel super fast at times. that being said, just like the astr classes, this course technically provides you with all the information necessary to pass. it just comes down to how well you are able to absorb and understanding the material. if you need nw credits on top of the i&s provided by the class, i would recommend you take astr 150 at a minimum before this class.

"who do i contact about issues with a professors grading? tldr: i couldn’t answer for a 4th of the questions on my exam and my prof would not help me. who do i talk to?

i had an exam the other day and couldn’t understand a question. even worse the work for said question was needed for other questions and i effectively was unable to answer a forth of my test. i emailed my professor asking for clarification and never got anything back. i emailed again after the test asking if i could have some sort of retest or if i could have those questions ignored from my score and she refused and said she would not say anything else to me until grades were posted. 

i don’t know about everyone else, but any time a test question’s wording was confusing for students that question was either clarified or removed from grading. the one time i was testing at the drs and they couldn’t get ahold of the prof for clarification before the test ended they exempted the question for me. 

i have autism so it can be hard for me to understand or explain something when it comes to words. it’s not the first time i was unable to get clarification for a test question and then it happened that question was not counted for me.

plus several other students posted in piazza with confusion too. 

who do i talk do about this? 

some more details that might matter?:

this is for stat 311. my prof’s reasoning for rejecting my request was that it didn’t look like i understood the concepts for the question in the first place when i originally asked for clarification. from what i understood, the question asked for a description of the sampling distribution, and to find the mean and standard deviation for a histogram that showed the age range of voters vs what percent that age range made of all voters. what confused me was that it asked for the distribution of the 55-64 age voters, not the distribution of all voters, or so i understood it. so i messaged my prof asking if there was supposed to be a scatter plot for this age range because the question asked for a description of the distribution. i then understood it to mean i’m supposed to compare the distribution or in other words percent of voters that were ages 55-64 vs every other age ranger. of course you cant compute a mean or sd for that, but i ran out time, i just wanted to have proof that i was confused on how i was supposed to understand the question, and i needed to put down something. 

i emailed professor again and she said that because i asked her if i was supposed to have a scatter plot, i could have not understood the concept in the first place as this is a question about sampling distribution, which has nothing to do with scatter plots. the reason i asked for a scatter plot was because part of the question asked to describe the distribution which made me thing of that. regardless, as i mentioned in the above paragraph, i then understood the question to ask to compare the percentages of voters age 55-64 vs every other age range which is categorical and would technically give a sampling distribution. however i never mentioned it to her during the exam because she never responded back, what are the odds she would respond this time, and i never mentioned it after because i through it was irrelevant as the bottom line was that i was confused by the question and couldn’t actually answer it. i can’t explain it to her now because the last thing she said to me was that she would not respond anymore until grades were posted.

i'm currently writing a piece about harry styles' vogue cover. there's a few different perspectives on the ""controversy"" that has ensued since its release, and i'm primarily focusing on the following: 

> the history of trans femmes in fashion, how they're the pioneers of gender-neutral fashion and often have their stories erased from history

> how black male artists (like prince, lenny kravitz, jaden smith, billie porter...) have been challenging gender norms through fashion long before this

> the conservative backlash from owens and shapiro

"warning for new students coming from high school (ap credits) tl;dr: don't apply ap credits to your transcript until you know know you need them to graduate.

edit: there are some insights in the comments that are contrary to what i have in this post, so if anyone is facing this situation, look below for more experiences!

i wanted to make a warning that i really wish i heard from someone before i entered the uw.

once you apply ap credits to your transcript, you cannot take them off.this is an issue because once you reach 225 credits, you are ineligible for financial aid for the credits you take after that.so if you decide to pursue a minor or a double major, which you need to take more credits for, but bring in a bunch of ap credits beforehand, that cap will prevent you from receiving financial aid when you take classes that exceed 225 credits.

my advice is:

* don't apply your ap credits to your transcript until you know:

1. exactly what requirement you are applying them to
2. you will not take a class during your time at uw that would eventually satisfy that requirement anyway

* don't apply ap english(both lang and lit) unless you only need to fill a certain number of credits. they don't fulfill any requirements and are just empty credits.

i have no idea how running start works, so i can't say anything about that.

i'm double majoring and won't be eligible for financial aid during my senior year because of the cap.when i made an inquiry about removing ap credits that i don't need that would put me under the cap until i graduate, the admissions office told me i couldn't.

if anyone has advice for me, that would be much appreciated, but i had no idea this could be an issue when i entered the uw. i was always under the impression from everyone around me that more ap credits were always better. this is not always true, so be wise before sending your scores in.

thank you for reading what is essentially a vent post lol if anyone has advice, please please let me know.",advice

"questions comparing uw vs wwu from prospective student hi everybody. i'm getting out of the army and am looking at heading to school for environmental science. i've got wwu and uw (all 3 campuses) in mind and i'd like some insight from the attendees about the differences between the two as a whole campus, pros and cons, and key insights into details of the environmental science program.

specific questions:

-let me hear your insights on comparing the two.

-what does the job outlook like for environmental science after graduating wwu vs. uw

-part time opportunities. how accessible are they between the two universities both on and off campus?

-i'll be living off campus and commuting in. any significant considerations for either uni/campus on housing or commuting?

-veterans/va support. a bit specific to my situation, but what kind of veterans support stuff is on campus?

-the city. i'm from portland or but have lived in upstate ny for the last few years, what's the general vibe of bellingham vs seattle/tacoma/bothell?

-class size. i know western is far smaller than uw. how does it affect you at your school? is it an issue or a boon?

-extracurriculars. mature students. i'll be a 23 year old off campus freshman. any insight into that experience.
-kind of tied in with the above - internships, research opportunities. i've read into hiring demographics for my desired major and it's essentially decided by your fieldwork/internships. what sort of opportunities have you guys had access to at your various campuses?

-any further advice on anything surroundimg the above, sage life advice, college advice, picking class. its all welcome and i'm all ears.

full disclosure, this is a blanket post between the wwu subreddit and the uw subreddit so i can get a range of takes. i hope that's not an issue.

"story of my fall quarter. this quarter started off so well (i thought): interesting classes, reopened restaurants and gyms, and relatively returned social life around campus.

however, looking at myself now, i'm agonized over failed exams, messy living space, fucked up schedule, non-existent social life, receding leanness, and little motivation. i have a few friends whom i used to rely on so much for social life who left the state of washington and won't be back for a while. ima used to be my coping method against stress and anxiety and that's not of any possibility for me. i hate living alone, so i would go out and wander around but even the most ordinary activities like 'having a sip of coffee sitting down' have been taken away from me after nov 17th. where is the laughter in the hub, where is the studiousness in suzallo, where is the constant chatter in kane, where are the smiley faces at the quad. i'm not seeing them and it's breaking my heart.

i know that people say hardship in life teaches one to be stronger and more resilient but i'm inundated by so much inopportune experience all at the same time and i don't have time to recover myself from one to move on to another. to be candid this has arguably been the worst time so far of my 20 years of life. i'm easily irritable, anxious af, depressed, unstable, confrontational, agonized, hopeless, and friendless. my soul is teared apart, i'm a walking cadaver.

i tried to get therapy but since everything is online, i'm not feeling its healing power as it should have given to its recipients if done offline.

i hope everyone of you who's reading this realizes having the company of friends, roomates, family, or even significant others during such harsh times is a luxurious privilege to people like me, and being able to just finish school work while still having a basic schedule is also a respectable achievement that you should be proud of yourself. acknowledge yourself and people around you, be grateful of how life is still moving on although it might seem frivolous for me to say.  at last, smile and be happy for people like me who are unable to do so.

this quarter started off promising, i was hoping to find my motivation for academics again, but after a few weeks of missing and assignment here and there and occasionally missing a lecture because it feels pointless to get out of bed, i've found myself failing 2 classes again. i even took only 12 credits this quarter and it's still too much to handle. i only have enough in me for one class. i've tried again and again to put as much effort into all my classes online as i did when they were in person and i've come the conclusion that after this long i just can't. if they didn't introduce the s/ns option for quarters taken during the global pandemic i would have probably dropped out by now.

online classes just feels pointless... ""going to school"" is now just walking 10 feet from my bed to my desk.

i'm hoping someone can relate 💀",student life

but, i’m just having trouble with midterms!

i wanna go to med school, which i know is a very stereotypical freshman’s dream. & i know that a 2.9 in a 1st quarter biology class in very bad for med school. 

any advice??? should i retake?? do s/ns?? any study tips???

"hcde: graduate school? hi everyone,

i wanted to post this question because i feel that i get many mixed responses regarding graduate school for people going into the ux field. as an undergrad in the hcde program, i was considering applying for the department's masters program, but i'm worried about the prospect of paying off student loans that i feel will accumulate too much over time (note: im a oos student). 

a lot of people i've talked to say that graduate school is unnecessary, particularly in the ux field, and developing a strong portfolio is much preferred. however, my question is that wouldn't going to graduate school strengthen your overall portfolio and resume? additionally, when searching for careers, it seems many of the positions seek for people with more work experience and preferably a degree higher than that of a bs. i feel that i would stand no chance compared to much more experienced candidates with refined portfolios when it comes to the competition for jobs. 

it also seems that much of the ""prestige"" of the hcde dept. lies in their master's programs as i can't seem to find too much information regarding the bachelor's program. maybe i'm wrong. but, i just feel really lost about this subject because i've really yet to figure out my career track, let alone figure out if graduate school is something i should consider. i'm panicking because i'm going to be a junior soon, and i have no idea what i want to do with my degree or have even started a solid portfolio. 

for hcde people, how difficult was it to find a job, particularly with a bs degree? is graduate school worth the financial investment? for those going into hcde ms program, why did you choose to do so? what differences are there in bs and ms programs for hcde? do you have any advice on how to get started on your portfolio early?

i’m hoping to go into ux design or research in the future so the reason i applied to engineering was because of the hcde program, which i believe is pretty good for ux careers. one worry i had was if i didn’t end up getting that major, since i know that it’s really competitive at uw but i’m not really interested in any other engineering major so if i don’t get it i’m not sure what i’ll do.

i’m also a bit confused on how they guarantee that everyone gets a engineering major. i think hcde is one of the less competitive engineering majors but if i repeatedly apply and get denied how can i expect to get into another major that’s more difficult?

"hansee 3 person suite vs mcmahon double room + general north campus advice hello! 
incoming freshman here. 
i'm considering north campus dorms...

out of the 6 dorms, 4 are extremely similar in pricing and dorm layout... and i'm not too sure about these 4 cuz a 4 person or 3 person suite i feel is pretty small and not worth it??? the doubles and singles here are just outta my reach :(

*i'm not striking of these 4 options, still considering them*

so the remaining two are hansee and mcmahon.

♤ in hansee, i'm considering a 3 person suite which is 6k per year. i just want to know your opinions. 

i've heard hansee is very quiet and everyone is not that social??? but a 3 person suite will be more social i think?
do many freshmen live in hansee?

also it has a bicycle storage room (unlike mcmahon) inside which is a big plus for me. i plan to get a cycle to go to class as well as for recreation.

♤ in mcmahon, i'm looking at the double room which is 7k per year.

i've heard mcmahon is very social due to the cluster system. do many freshmen live in mcmahon?

there is no cycle storage... we have to keep it outside the bldg on the rails... very likely to be stolen.

☆☆☆ the thing is i like quiet environments to some extent, where i can focus on academics... not extremely noisy and stuff.
hansee and mcmahon seem to be on two extreme ends. i believe some sociability is important which a 3 or 4 person suite in hansee will facilitate???☆☆☆

i'm sorry for the long post but it would be very helpful if you can drop me your opinions.

"why is gh 101 so hard? dont take?! quick rant/advice for people who are going to take this class. i find gh 101 to be extremely difficult and as someone who has taken weed-out courses at the uw, i don't understand why the staff is being so unhelpful. we have weekly quizzes worth 10% of our grade but they're just fine. for some reason my ta finds a reason to take a couple points off each assignment for a little reason like spacing, formatting, or something related to not answering the whole question even though there's only 150 words and i mentioned all of the different factors like structural adjustment programs. i don't know why they're treating a 100 level class like a 400 level one, and believe me i've taken 400 level global/public health classes. the weekly assignment are super time consuming and it would be nice of them to make them more creative to do. or clarify their high expectations. 

also, i just looked it up, but the professor has like 1.9/5 reviews on rate my professor which makes sense considering how i see more of my tas than the the professor, and all of the lectures are online lectures with a speaker talking over the slides which are photos. besides tuesdays lectures, you never even see the professors or get feedback/advice/help from them which i understand! they are just active on the discussion board. and yes they seem like nice people just not good professors. also, i don't think they create a very inclusive environment for poc but that's another thing. racism in the healthcare field is also an important topic to discuss. if i'm sounding negative i apologize, it's just that i expected more from the class and i'm putting in a lot of work in the readings taking notes and the lectures. i've also attended office hours but my ta doesn't give me advice on how to improve or what their looking for. i enjoyed global health before taking this class, and unless they change the structure, i wouldn't recommend it for incoming freshman or anyone interested in global health majors or minors.",academics

in my case, i'm a cis-gender woman and i wouldn't want to live with someone of the opposite sex, but i wouldn't mind living with someone who is non-binary, gender fluid, or a transwoman. basically, i don't have any preference between living with another cisgender woman or living with someone who isn't cis, as long as they don't identify as male.

i only see a ""yes/no"" option for this, no ""no preference"" option. does choosing yes mean that i'm  saying i only want to live with someone else who chose this option or just that i'm open to the idea? does choosing no mean that i'm saying i wouldn't want to room with a transwoman or non-binary person? does choosing yes mean that i'm saying i would be fine with living with someone who identifies as male (cis or otherwise)?

"random advice for freshmen here is a random jumble of advice and info i wish i knew/thought of before coming to uw (much of this is dorm related)

 

* 8 am in high school is very different from 8 am in college. unless you are absolutely sure that you are a morning person--like the type of person who wakes up at 6 a.m.--do not take classes before 10 a.m.! 
* get the lowest level dining account. if you find you need more money you can always level your account up, but if you start with an expensive dining account and you don't spend the money, you're screwed.
* you might not like your roommates. it's fine. even if you talk to them for months before, sometimes it just doesn't work out and that's okay. it happens to a lot of people.
* closet measurements: that rack for hanging your clothes is 32 inches. (hope this helps y'all not overpack)
* worried about storage space? grab yourself one of these bad boys at a very reasonable price from target: https://www.target.com/p/11-8-cube-organizer-shelf-room-essentials-153/-/a-51256587?preselect=15113339#lnk=sametab 
* don't know who needs to hear this, but you do not need to bring that many pairs of shoes. 
* bring several towels. ideally thinner ones so they dry properly.
* clothes you *need*:  a good rain jacket. ideally two. two pairs of rain shoes, either waterproof or water-resistant. that's right, you will thank me for this.
* don't bring tide pods. the washers don't get hot enough for them to melt. 
* bringing posters? scotch mounting putty works great for hanging them on dorm walls! tape… not so much. 
* get a minifridge, get a good one! you do not really need a microwave, every dorm floor has two microwaves so you're not going to have to walk super forward to access a fancy and high-quality microwave. 
* you will in fact need a power cord--the outlets are few and far spread so if you plan on having a lamp, your computer, a clock, and phone plugged in at your desk, you will need this. 
* buy one of those eye masks for sleeping and practice sleeping in it. well look stupid and it's not the most comfortable at first, you and your roommate will thank me when it's 2 a.m. and you want to sleep, and they need to have the lights on so they can stay awake and cram study for a test.  no matter the brightness or what time of day it is, you put that sucker on, and it's pitch black and perfect for sleeping.
* there is no ac in the dorms. you have a heater in your room but the highest i can go is 74 degrees. it autoshuts on at 55 degrees. thus far it has not gotten hot enough that i would want ac but just a heads up it isn't an option.
* bring lights. lamps, string lights, anything. the dorm lighting sucks and the rooms are so gloomy, dark, and depressing. 
* there will be very little daylight during the winter months. some days, if you sleep in late and wake up at 3 p.m, you open your blinds to find it is already dark outside. during these months make sure you get up and experience a few hours of sunlight a day or you will get seasonal depression. it's very real, and it sucks. 
* aleks is evil. learn to fear and hate the name, chances are you'll understand later. 
* sometimes there are homeless people wandering around west campus. most of them are chill, some of them are weird. sometimes the front of the dorm buildings smells like human urine.
* the dining hall food sucks. buy yourself a pan, pot, spatula, knife, mixing bowl, and cutting board from target or ikea or somewhere in case you ever cook. that's honestly about all you need....
* bring a vacuum. and a duster. the dorm's floors get so dirty so fast, and the room gets so damn dusty from the vents. 
* do not overload your schedule! college classes are a lot more self-taught than high school. balance is important, for everyone hard class you're taking, balance it with a passion class or a fun class your first quarter to allow yourself breathing room to adjust. pair your chem class with a film appreciation class or psychology of human sexuality, and your bio class with ceramics or creative writing. you get the idea.
* do not hook up with someone on your dorm hall floor, rookie mistake and it is awkward for the whole year. i did not do it but i know too many people who did eek
* spreadsheet, spreadsheet, spreadsheet! canvas and it's annoying to use in my opinion, the only way i kept from forgetting assignments as i spent hours the first day of school making a spreadsheet ordering all the assignments, tests, quizzes, and projects to speak to a spreadsheet organized by date. then throughout the quarter i just stayed ahead and crossed stuff off the list.",advice

"registration: when should i take physics 114 series? (and should i take accelerated or honors chem) hey everyone! so i’m a prospective bio major, working towards chem minor, and on a pre-med track and i’m trying to figure out my sophomore & junior year schedule! would appreciate any input!

background: i did well and really enjoyed in ap chem in hs (got credit for 142 and 152, but have to retake sequence for med school) did honors physics and 1 quarter of ap physics mechanics (which i didn’t like but was ok at). i am finishing intro bio series this quarter. i want to be able to take the mcat at the end of junior year, so i should be done with gen chem, physics, o chem, and bio chem by end of junior year. 

what i “should” do: take accelerated chem (143/153) this year &amp; and physics 114 sequence. next year take o chem and bio chem. this is think workload-wise makes the most sense, right?

what i want to do: take honors chem (1x5 sequence) this year, o chem and bio chem junior year, and maybe phys 114 sequence next year? or this year?

i was looking into honors chem and honestly it really speaks to me content-wise - i got really excited. i’m not worried so much about the difficulty, rather the work load. if i did honors, when should i take physics? and should i just not do honors and do the more reasonable accelerated sequence?

sorry this is really long if you read this thank you you’re awesome. 

also to any other pre-med kids out there, if you take med school pre-reqs you will be only 1-2 chem courses away from a chem minor (depending on if you take reg vs accelerated/honors chem sequence)

"rc student questions i just got accepted to the uw robinson center program as a freshman for 2021. i had some questions about the point of the rc in general.   
1) are students that take the rc program really ahead of their peers in high school? it seems that rc path is basically the same as running start. what is the point of taking rc if it doesn't even give the student an advantage on completing an undergrad program?  
2) rc students need to take 1 year of ""transition"" to achieve 105 credits and 5 quarters before being able to declare a major. i think this factors the required cadrs not completed in high school. is this normal for all uw freshman to need 105 credits before declaring a major? am i literally paying a year's worth of college for high school credits??  


3) i read that if you're not a direct admit, then there is no point going to the computer science route. as a rc student, i can't be counted as a direct admit because i can't even declare a major until after 1-2 years. how will being a rc student affect my chances?  


i am super confused and disillusioned at the prospect of this since rc never really described all the cons of the program. maybe i'm just being dumb but if everything i said above is true, then i don't understand the point of rc. i know that uw is a really good computer science school, but i don't see the advantages of rc over running start, or just finishing 2 years and applying to mit or stanford. any help is appreciated! i feel so lost.",advice

they also will not eat anything other than americana. if you gave my dad a chicken quesadilla, he would cut it open with a fork and pick out the bits of chicken. we're talking burgers, chicken, any of olive garden's most popular dishes, steak, pepperoni pizza, etc. no fish. rarely veggies. the only veggies i ever ate growing up were roasted broccoli and basic salads. i think the only vegetarian meal i ever ate at home before becoming a vegetarian myself (which is also something i need to contend with here) was a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. so, pizza, but in a different form.

changes since last month:

* more context menu options

* new minimap

* new ability to edit course data

* new option to add courses from text search, which should make it easy to add batches of electives/concentration courses.

* new course table to view all course data in one place.

* added natural sciences, environmental, and informatics majors. but, i'm pretty sure the [data](https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) is outdated, so check before using.

* updated [degree course lists](https://github.com/awu43/prereq-flow-degrees) with course names.

what's still missing:

* grouping — unfortunately, the library i'm using to generate the graphs doesn't support grouping at the moment so there's no easy way to represent a condition like ""10 credits from approved electives"".

"in state college or uw? uw is my dream school and i accepted my offer for fall 2021. while i've been planning on going to uw for the last 3 years, i can't ignore the debt that it would put me in, especially being an out of state student. yet i keep getting opportunities to have a cheap tuition if i attend a college in my state, which sounds wonderful, but not as wonderful as attending my dream school. 

i've bought uw merch, visited seattle just so i can get a glimpse of uw life, bragged, came to terms with pre majors and weed off classes, made uw friends, and already found roommates and an off campus apartment to live in. 
but i'd be financially restricted going to uw, i wouldn't be able to enjoy a life aside from college like travelling here and there or during the summer.

 but then there's the option to attend college where i live for two years then transfer to uw and my debt wouldn't be as big plus i'd have more money in my pocket for whatever. i know it would be a huge financial relief and my future self would appreciate it but it would also be a personal let down for me.

advice please.

edit: 
thank you all!!! i really appreciate the advice and all the input you guys gave. it was a lot to think about and also a lot more factors to consider. just thank you guys so much! 

my final decision is that for my first two years of college, i'd spend it at uw. while this doesn't eliminate the chance for debt it shouldn't be too high either. then after uw i can transfer to my state school. it sounds backwards, i know, but this way i at least get to experience being a student at uw (and have a legit reason for my uw merch) and after having my fill, i go back home where the cheap tuition is.",advice

both apartments are located on the west of campus which seems to be rife with theft, crimes, break-ins, and homeless people? reviews are either really good (like, 5-star good which seem kind of fake or written by management, i don't know what to believe) or they're horrid, lambasting every feature of the apartment. i couldn't find any other apartment with a decent rating in a 0.75 mile radius of the campus either. is this the reality of off-campus housing in seattle? i have night classes and need to be within walking distance (<1mi) because i don't have a car.

"advice to deal with exam regrets hello everyone,

i need some serious advice right now. so about a week and a half ago, i had a physics 116 exam that didn't go as well as i expected. i was super bummed because the exam seemed easy enough when i was doing it but my score said otherwise. the answer key was released over the weekend and i made the unfortunate decision to take a look at what i got wrong. i don't know why i did this to myself but now i can't stop thinking about it.

for those who don't know how the physics exams work - we have 20 questions, each 5 points so essentially each question is worth 5%. after looking at my exam, i realized that i somehow made 3 of the stupidest mistakes ever which caused me to lose 15 points and hence 15% (i got 75% but could've gotten 90%). i don't even know how i missed those because i got them correct when i redid them and i have been feeling really guilty.

now, every time i try to study physics, that keeps popping up in my brain and i feel like its eating m alive - honestly.

i just feel so guilty and am so scared about the next exam and what might happen there. because of my bad score here, i need to ace my next exam so that i can still get the grade that i want/need in that class.

"my advice for incoming freshmen attending uw (part 1) going to college is not an easy thing because you'll face numerous invisible challenges starting your first quarter or semester. and your first year is the foundation for the entire undergraduate career, so some silly mistakes will cost you. as a rising sophomore this fall at the university of washington, here are my genuine advice on how to effectively and joyfully spend your first year. i hope it's helpful!

​

# 1. start connecting your classmates before the year begins

you'll very likely to find the group chat on the internet after you accepted the enrollment, or even before the admission cycle closed. social media platforms like discord, facebook, or loopchat usually have a big group chat that includes every member of the incoming class (if they get admitted), and some of the people in the group chat may still waitlisted. getting to know each other from here is a great opportunity, you will know people with various majors. later in the spring, you'll start to apply for the housing, and the best way is to reach out people, as many as possible. having your first group of college friends makes you advantaged than those who do not. simply, don't wait until the fall and panic.

​

# 2. do not pack your entire home to the dorm

as an international student from china, i was worried that i cannot get specific items abroad when packing for my first year of studying in 2016, so i literally squeezed as many things as possible into two 28-inch suitcases. unfortunately, my assumption was wrong. i can purchase all my stationaries, cookware, bedding supplies, and any general items at walmart, target, and many grocery stores. i understand you concern about cannot getting something you desire, but the university of washington itself is urban-setting, which you can get things you need within walkable distance. lastly, things like power outlet, bedding supplies, and clothes are made differently in the u.s., and i do not want you to unwillingly throw your stuff away if it doesn't fit.

​

# 3. the best way to beat homesickness is stay active

if you're an international or out-of-state student, you will probably hit a wall at sometime during the fall or early winter due to a combination of factors, which could be homesickness. this could happen anytime during the year when you feel unable to handle the cultural differences, language barriers, academic pressure, and loneliness. at this point, don't freak out. negative emotions and attitudes can adversely affect your mental health and academic success. now it's the time to talk to people around you, attend collegiate athletic events, join the student organizations, and do not stay inside your dorm 15 hours a day! social life and self-adjustment are the only ways can help you. once you get engaged, you will realize time pasts really fast.

​

# 4. take the entire core sequence courses if possible

lots of public flagship universities may have introductory sequence courses, especially for stem subjects, and those classes can be extremely challenging compared to some upper-division classes. the math 124-5-6 (introductory calculus sequence, also called math 12x) at uw is known for its rigor and students with ap calculus scores can directly jump into math 125 or math 126. but i strongly recommend you restart the sequence even you have ap calculus credits. math 12x courses are taught twice as fast as typical high school ap classes with higher expectations, if you don't get used to the college teaching style, you will not doing great even you already know the entire curriculum of math 12x. you need study skills to survive.

​

# 5. tenured professors are not always have fantastic teaching skills

sadly, you're less likely to have a ""teacher"" at uw or any large public universities, especially in stem classes. universities like uw and uc always hire professors to do specific researches for their departments, and the departments rarely offer specialized training on teaching. this results some professors are expertise in their fields but have zero experiences on teaching. they can teach classes, but not as good as your high school calculus teacher. they are paid for the research, not all the classes taught during the academic year. you cannot flip the professor's teaching style, so i suggest you either switch to another section, work hard with your classmates, or wait till next academic term. complaining doesn't solve anything.

​

# 6. make friends with common interests and hobbies only

college campus is huge enough to have people from different cultural backgrounds, so it's obvious that we will meet lots of ""weird"" people around. i know some incoming freshmen tend to blend in no matter what, to get them socially engaged. socializing is really fun, but sometimes it can be devastating if we used inappropriate manners. if you made a bunch of friends and found yourself unpleasant, steer clear. found something that fits your interest, go for it. in college campuses, the quality of your friends could influence your future development. a high-quality friend circle will help you building solid network beyond college, even for the entire life. ",student life

"dorm inspections? i asked a few weeks ago about the viability of bringing a large ant farm with me when i move on campus. the resounding consensus was that hfs would not approve of this in the slightest. while i am currently in negotiations with a buyer in oklahoma, he won't be able to take it until october, meaning i'll have to have it with me in my dorm room for at least a few weeks. furthermore, i am currently conducting research involving alcohol's impact on ant tunneling patterns, and would need to have a bottle of vodka with me in the dorm room at all times. i imagine getting caught with these things could prove disastrous. do hfs people actually come inspect people's dorm rooms regularly? if so, is it easy to conceal things (including mini-fridge sized ant farms)?

"an open letter the university of washington the university of washington has condemned me and other disabled students with immune deficiency, as well as their families. every 12 hours i take two medications to prevent my body from recognizing foreign solid organs that i received as part of a transplant. because of this, i am more susceptible to covid-19 and other infectious diseases, something i have known for a long time. what many don’t know is that an additional consequence of these medications is reduced vaccine efficacy. i have received two doses, a booster, and have had covid-19, and i still lack the antibodies to fight the disease.

the university of washington, like many other universities across the country, has opted for in-person learning this fall. most students and faculty are eager for the opportunity to be back on campus. however, the harsh reality for some is that the options provided by the university are subpar, dangerous, and are directly against access to learning for all students. i know i am not the only student with an immune deficiency, and i know that there are students with family members who are immune deficient.

the options before myself, as presented by the drs, are as follows: hope that professors are willing to alter their course structures significantly to accommodate a single student, take less courses, request accommodations through the drs which they have stated will be extremely limited and hard to acquire, or take the quarter off. most of these place undue stress on students and instructors, both emotionally as well as financially.

with little over a month until the beginning of fall quarter, myself and my living partner have had no access to resources to protect ourselves from covid-19 on campus. i have options, as listed above, however, my partner  — who sleeps next to me — has been told that there are no options for them, because they have no disability, making what little accommodations provided to myself useless so long as my partner must return to in-person learning.

i thank all the professors and advisors who’ve been corresponding with my partner and i this summer, trying to help in any way possible, and informing us that the university refuses to provide professors with guidance and resources for specific cases. this is the direct responsibility of the university, to provide guidance for student and faculty guidance, and reassurances that they will support all types of learning to guarantee that students can become educated in the safest and most effective way possible.

so while summer winds its way to a close and we continue to sit at home keeping our minds and bodies as active in any safe manner possible, the fall looms with unanswered questions, anxiety about more than assignments, and a sadness that the university i was once so proud to be a part of has become such a risk.

3. make multiple friend groups. not just that group of people on your floor who gush about superbad. because trust me if (actually when) that group falls apart you're going to feel like the whole world is ending. make friends everywhere and you're going to be just fine

4. that best friend 3,000 miles away from you? not worth staying in your room convincing her to video call when friends at your door are holding snacks and ice cream because they wanted to support you during that friend breakup. sometimes you outgrow people from your past and that's ok. it just means you're getting closer to being the person you're meant to be 

5. don't walk alone at night on the ave and greek row. if that boy cared about you, he would've cared about your safety

6. flick the bean in the morning. don't care how horny you are because 2 seconds away from finishing you're going to accidently make eye contact with your roommate who also thought you were sleeping...

7. 4am at ode with friends and strangers is going to make you happier than that one frat party 

8. stop taking school so serious and get out of your room. trust yourself that the after class revision was enough 

9. water and center table's scrambled eggs the next morning. your keys are in the fridge btw

10. ice in that drink! don't grind on the guy dressed up as harry potter! go with three friends if you anticipate going home with some other girl!

10. actually no take your studies seriously. after that first midterm, midterm season doesn't stop until 2 weeks before the end of quarter. get back on that smh

11. just know no matter what you did your best. you aren't perfect and no one is. even that girl who seems to have everything (4.0 in cse, a bf, perfect outfits, perfect body, etc.) focus on doing your best.

12. stop taking everything so goddamn personal. you aren't the moon kissing the night sky. you have to sing under the sea with all your heart. you have to shovel cheerios 2 mins before your 8:30 because you know you aren't going to function later. you have to pause for a minute and just admire those corgis. you have to stop spending hours after a test figuring out your grade and then your back up major. you've got to stop trying to make your neighbors like you. fuck it kid. you've got to love yourself.

13. i'm proud of you even if mom doesn't tell you. your value doesnt go down when she yells at you for not carrying your tracker (sorry i mean cellular device) everywhere. you aren't a whore

14. that guy from madrona? that girl from calc? those people you randomly met? i can't wait for you to get to know them because you're going to find so much love. open your heart to then and watch how you heal in a healthy environment. you deserve this

15. be boundless even if the campaign ends next year",advice

"how to get a credible esa letter (that works for uw on-campus housing and maybe off-campus housing)? hi, i have mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and i'd really like to get a pet during college to relax and ground me, especially because i'll be moving on-campus and having college classes in person for the first time. last year was my first year in college and i did distance learning living at home with my dysfunctional family :') and a week or two ago i went to the mall with my friends and got really burnt out for approximately two days just because i had too many ""hello, welcome to the store, are you looking for anything today?"" ""no, we're just browsing, thank you so much!"" interactions 💀, so the prospect of moving on-campus and having classes in person is very stressful for me. 

i messaged my doctor about having an emotional support animal as an option to support my mental health (they were the one who diagnosed me and also prescribed me medication, which has improved my baseline level of stress and speed of recovery from things like spirals, but i am still mentally ill, i'm sure), but i was told it was their organization's policy to not provide esa letters and they referred me to another organization to connect me to a therapist who would meet my needs. however, that organization told me that ""most providers will not see a patient just for a letter but are willing to write one after a few sessions if the patient plans on continuing seeing them for long term therapy"" and i'm not really certain that long term therapy is for me in terms of my finances and my specific relationship with my mental health. 

when i told them about my situation and ambivalence about long term therapy, they said that they could help me find a long term therapy provider, or if i only want an esa letter, to get one through esa doggy. however, some quick google searches say that esa doggy is maybe not legit and other esa letter websites say that they're legit, but other's aren't (and they throw shade at each other, though they also all claim to connect people to a local licensed professional who is qualified to write an esa letter), and some places say that no esa letters provided through online means are legit so 🤡.

i'd really appreciate if a current or recent uw student could tell me about how the process works and how i can obtain a legit esa letter. i'm also going to be rooming with some friends this year on campus and one of them is on the fence about having a pet in their space because we have to share a room (which is fair and i respect that) so we wanted to wait until the end of autumn quarter and get an esa during the winter break, and i wanted to get the approval process done ahead of time because i thought it might take a while, so i have some time to find figure out what's best for me and to deliberate. the esa will also likely be a crested gecko because my one of my roommates is allergic to furry pets and after a lot of research, i currently feel like it would be the best pet i could care for that also fits my needs.

 tldr: can any current/recent uw student tell me about the process to getting a legit esa letter",advice

"going back on campus (rant + advice for incoming students) i have been abroad working in a few countries in northern africa the last few months and i am so excited to come back for fall quarter. i am genuinely giddy. my god i miss everyone so much. not just my friends that i haven’t seen the last few months but the pre-covid university atmosphere and every little great and shitty thing that comes with it. 

like many people here, i am definitely a little nervous going back in person. but my sheer joy currently is overruling every other emotion i am currently experiencing. 

for those of you who are anxious though and have not been on campus previously, here is an (unsolicited) message for you: you are not alone and don’t let the overwhelming, big school atmosphere paralyze you. 

while i don’t believe in fate, i believe that because uw is so big and provides so many opportunities that there truly is a community for everyone, you just have to take the time to find it. 

if this is your first quarter on campus, slow down, remember to breathe, and remember that everyone takes different periods of time to adjust to new environments. 

also, if any new foster students have any questions about getting adjusted or just want to talk, dm me. i am also always free for a coffee chat in paccar :)

"stay safe on the ave guys! so, yesterday, after a night of fun and excitement, i decided to refill my stomach with some late night tacos at memos and headed over there. while i was waiting in line, one guy was pushed into the shop by a shirtless guy violently. the shirtless guy started pummeling the other one with punches around and around the floor for what seemed like a good five minutes before he was called out by his companions and left. during the fight, plastic signboards were thrown, chairs shoved and the customers of the restaurant were invisible to the attackers eyes.

but that wasn't the end of my crazy night. immediately after the scene and the actors cleared up, another guy entered the shop through the open window, moved a chair around to the garbage disposal at the center of the restaurant, dug though the trash and started drinking something he found in there. he ambled around for a few minutes, picked up and pocketed what seemed like a knife to me and tried to sneak away with takeout boxes. he was stopped by one of the restaurant workers on his way out and gave up though.

i had to wait a good five to ten minutes for my order to be complete and then left for home. on my way out who do i see? the same actors still roaming about on the ave. with a lot of new students coming in, this is just a reminder to stay safe, avoid sketchy areas, not venture out too late alone or to move in groups at such times. be boundless guys!!",student life

"[u-pass] remember to tap on and tap off on light rail for some students who use the light rail in wa for the first time, please remember to tap on before you board the train, and tap off after you leave the train.

if you fail to tap on before you board the train, when a fare enforcement officer comes around to check that you paid your fare,  **you might run the risk of a $124 citation.**

# if you’re transferring to a bus or another train? 

# should you still tap off? 

**yes!** if you get off a link train without tapping your u-pass, when you tap your u-pass to get on another train, the reader will actually register that as a tap off. if a fare enforcement officer checks your card now, it will show that you haven’t tapped on for your second train. there’s that citation risk **of $124** again.

here is what you should do:

1. tap on before boarding any transit vehicle using your u-pass.
2. if you’re riding on link light rail or a sounder train, tap off at the end of your ride.
3. if you’re transferring, just follow those steps again on the next leg of your trip. that orca technology inside your husky card will be able to tell that you’re transferring. it’s that smart!

another reason for tapping on and tapping off your husky card is to **keep the cost down** for everyone. if you fail to tap off and are charged for a more expensive trip than the one you took, the u-pass program has to pay the difference.

for example, if a u-pass member takes a ride downtown from uw station to do some shopping, the cost of the trip should be about $2.50. but if the u-pass member doesn’t tap off, the program is charged about $3.25.

i mean, i'm slowly recovering from covid quarantine aftermath by trying to be more outgoing and talking to people but i noticed that the friendship doesn't last these days which happens all the time. 

but the fear is still there; i mean after all, i'm transferred senior but i have no experiences of being on campus for longer than a month before this term so i know absolutely no one so far. and really i feel like i got nothing out of this university because of how much opportunity i have lost to network with people. i'm sure most of you feels the same. 

and plus the fact that i'm little older than an average student here doesn't help; most of people immediately dropped me after telling them that i'm turning 26 this year. that literally made me devastated for few days thinking that i literally can't make friend here. everyone is smarter than me and young, and people i encountered were people who wants to talk to people around their age. 

i don't know where to even start. thinking about these just makes me feel pathetic. i know i shouldn't complain, but i ran out of idea. i tried talking to classmate, posting things here, going to club, and overall tried my hardest to engage with them but it wasn't any useful. at this point it feels like i'm thrown in a cell except i can freely go home.

i'm suppose to graduate this spring and i only have 5 class left to take, not including this quarter.   
my problem is, i was planning on taking these two classes at the same time next quarter (class a and class b). but, i just learned that class a is actually a prereq for class b.   


i'm currently freaking out because i was not aware of this, nor did my advisors let me know despite me going to them for academic help. i do not want to wait a whole year to graduate just to take one class. if i were to take class a next quarter and then class b, i'll end up being a whole quarter behind because class b is a series class that requires me to take one more class after it (class c).   


i already emailed my advisors about this situation but do yall think i'll be able to still take both classes at the same time? class b has three class prereqs that i needed to take, two of which i already took and did above a 3.0 on. class a is the third class in a series and which i did very well on in the first two quarters.",academics

"it's that time again; guys if you're going to approach a girl in public, here's how to do it we're back on campus and haven't talked to people on campus in over a year. it's weird and we're all socially (and probably touch) deprived. if you want to make friends or find a potential partner, chances are you've considered the cold-approach of just walking up to a cute stranger and asking them out.

for reasons you may never fully understand, this can be scary for women. always has been, always will. as a woman who's had this happen a not-insignificant number of times, it really depends on the situation. sometimes it's straight-up predatory, and even if you aren't a creep, we still have to be prepared for that. we get that some people are really trying to be nice, but it's awkward because of the timing/location/lack of social skills so here's some advice:

the best of intentions can still make moments like this plenty upsetting! pick your time/place carefully-- if she's near the front of a 30 min line at the suzzalo starbucks, she's not going to be able to leave if she feels uncomfortable. also 9am is a little early to get hit on, at least let her finish her coffee.

don't open with a comment on physical appearance (unless it's to compliment a specific piece of clothing or pin or something you have in common). we already know that's what got your attention. you can work in a compliment whilst flirting, but don't start there-- there are plenty of things more interesting about her than her physical appearance, and she'll be very impressed if you manage to convey that in the first 20 seconds. instead, start with a greeting that gives her a chance to answer how she's doing and importantly, if this is a good time to talk (you're not more important than cramming for a midterm, so if that's what's happening at the library then don't drag it out). if you get a conversation going, offer small bits of information like what/where your housing is or what your year/major is-- just things that turn you into a real person in her head instead of a random stranger from who-knows-where). keep this convo brief-- even if she seems interested, a) she's probably also still in the middle of something, and b) you don't want to play your whole hand at once-- leave her wondering more about you. the more you talk the more likely it is she'll hear something that kills her interest. if your goal is a date, wait til then before you start diving into how compatible you might be.

now for your exit strategy-- this is the most important part. even if it's going well, if it's not a good time or she seems uncomfortable here's what you should say/do: ""anyways, i'm \[insert name here\], i should probably get going but i'd really like to get to know you better. can i give you my number/snapchat?"" (if you managed to find a common hobby, invite her to participate in said hobby with you). and then here's the kicker- do not give her your phone or ask for hers. give your number/snap to her on a piece of paper, old-fashioned style (but write it out in front of her so it doesn't look like you've been handing out business cards to every other girl). you don't really have to wait for an answer, just hand it to her/leave it on the table, and make a swift exit (throw in a ""have a nice day"" or even a ""talk to you later!"" if you're feeling bold).

it may catch her off guard, but in a good way-- it'll make you stand out and seem classier, more like the male lead of her fave 2000s rom com and less like someone who just hits on girls as a hobby and collects numbers like pokemon cards. this also gives her the chance to decide if she's interested without the fear of someone she doesn't know having her contact information, or having someone hover over her to make that decision on the spot. less of a chance of a knee-jerk ""no"" reaction. if she's interested, she'll reach out. if not, drop it. you don't want to chase after someone who isn't interested in you anyways.

a few final notes on flirting/the conversation itself:  
\- confidence is by far the most important thing-- if you seem nervous, she's gonna think you're swinging out of your league and she shouldn't settle (related-- don't swing out of your league; aka don't pick the hottest person you see, pick someone who might pick you too)

\- smile and try to get her to smile; you don't have to be funny but be nice

\- plan what you're going to ask her before you approach, but don't try to memorize a script-- find something specific about her to ask about, it's much easier for her to talk about herself than follow a random topic of conversation

\- again, keep it brief. the longer you interrupt her day, the greater the chance of annoying her to saying no for reasons unrelated to your charms

finally, this is not the ideal way to meet someone-- you should really use this as a last resort if you don't have any opportunities to meet people in your classes or at a club meeting or through friends

y'all are gonna shoot your shot anyways though so hopefully this'll save everyone involved from a very awkward encounter. good luck gents",advice

so i'd decided to be little different (although it's not original idea) and creative about making connection; making this post to be a self introduction thread where you comment your brief introduction about yourself on this thread and reply to people that you are interested in being friend with. and if you got replies from people on your intro, you could possibly take your discussion in dm 👌

i'd start off myself for the intro:

my name is jae, who is transferred senior and going to turn 26 next month. currently in communication major, and pursuing entrepreneurship minor. i like that i'm easy going, understanding and try to be considerate. i'm little shy and can be awkward time to time but i like to think myself that i'm fun person to be around. i laugh a lot so maybe some of my happy energy might pass onto u 😀
i also play drums and spend quite a bit of time listening to music. if you are ever interested talking about musics or video games, let's vibe 👌 feel free to pm me if you are interested 👀


and of course you don't have to leave an intro if you don't want to! just thought this would be a fun way of making connections 👉👈",student life

"ultimate guide to uw seattle campus (registration, buildings) as the registration for winter 2022 begins, you will take another batch of classes at different locations. however, college campus is huge compared to high school campus. here's my ultimate guide on how to not get lost on uw campus. i divide the uw seattle campus into six regions: up north, montlake east, red square, fountain, waterfront southwest, and far south.  


**the up north region (6)**

* ***buildings***: *parrington hall (par), denny hall (den), paccar hall (pcar), dempsey hall (dem), hutchinson hall (hut), and bank of america executive education center (exed)*.
* ***tips***: buildings at the up north region are typically on the top of the hill, which you need to walk or run uphill from anywhere on the campus. except for parrington hall, all the buildings are next to each other. i recommend you walk fast, not run, when going uphill so you can save more energy before class starts.

**the montlake east region (8)**

* ***buildings***: *loew hall (low), mechanical engineering building (meb), mueller hall (mue), more hall (mor), bill & melinda gates cse center (cse2), thomson hall (tho), clark hall (clk), and communications building (cmu)*.
* ***tips***: mostly downhill, except for the segment of east stevens way from mueller hall to loew hall. those building are the closest to the ima fields and building but far away from the ave. some recitation sections or seminar-style classes are held at either loew hall, mechanical engineering building, or thomson hall. if you do not want to walk uphill, then take bus route 372 or 75 and get off by padelford hall. not recommend using the burke-gilman trail, you will climb lots of stairs (unless you like it).

**the red square region (9)**

* ***buildings***: *kane hall (kne), savery hall (sav), gowen hall (gwn), smith hall (smi), miller hall (mlr), raitt hall (rai), music building (mus), art building (art), and meany hall (mny)*.
* ***tips***: since these buildings are clustered around the red square, so there will be lots of people walking around from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. when walking at the red square region, please walk gently while speedy, and don't push or mess up the crowds. bricks at the red square can be slippery at times, be cautious. also, from kane hall to art building is a hill.

**the fountain region (10)**

* ***buildings***: *mary gates hall (mgh), sieg hall (sig), johnson hall (jhn), bagley hall (bag), guggenheim hall (gug), electrical and computer engineering building (ece), chemistry library building (chl), nano science building (nan), atmospheric science-geophysics building (atg), benson hall (bns) and chemistry building (chb).* 
* ***tips***: hill climbings at johnson-mary gates hall walkway and rainier vista. if you're going from ece building to miller hall, you need to speed walk. walking fast at an uphill slope is easier than downhill. mary gates hall has multiple exits on the first floor. walking towards the hub-sieg area and making turns to avoid the crowds. for those classes at either bns, chl, atg, or bag, take the west stevens way to the red square or west campus dorms and buildings.

**the waterfront southwest region (11)**

* ***buildings***: *marine studies building (mar), fishery science building (fsh), fisheries teaching building (ftr),  hitchcock hall (hck), physics/astronomy auditorium (paa), physics/astronomy building (pab), kincaid hall (kin), condon hall (cdh), gould hall (gld), architecture hall (arc), and social work building (sws)*.
* ***tips***: they're far away, and i do not recommend having another class at those buildings back-to-back (paa and pab are not terrible in term of the distance). if you have to take it here, then you could either speed walk, jog, or come late to the class (not recommended), especially for the fishery science building. hitchcock hall is located next to life science building and kincaid hall, the second overpass bridge from the west. for condon hall, take the 41st street to avoid traffic lights. for gould hall, jaywalk campus parkway and take the overpass. 

**the far south region (6)**

* ***buildings***: *bloedel hall (bld), anderson hall (and), wickenwerder forest lab (wfs), health science tower (hst), health science building (hsb), and roberts hall (rob)*.
* ***tips***: far away. walk fast or jog.",student life

"depressed and in need of help hello all! i'm currently a freshman from california and i feel like i made the wrong choice i'm coming here. i'm someone who struggled with ptsd, depression and anxiety in high school and i honestly never saw myself even making it to college. 

i chose uw bc of how many opportunities i felt like i would have. i came in with an open mind ready to make the most out of everything.

since being here- i have started struggling with serious depression again. i lack the energy to even go to class and i can't preform to the best of my ability despite how much i wanted to love it here. 

i also don't know what i want to major in yet, but the capacity constrained majors and weed out classes are definitely getting me down. if i knew what i wanted i could work towards it but i'm not at the point i know what i want to do.

i also have a health condition and my bronco spasm flares in cold weather which i found out after being here.i can't even go outside for a walk to feel better during these times. 

i have the option to go home and do community and transfer to a uc after two years. but even with that there are cons and fomo i could get. my life would be a lot more simple and calm at home but i don't know if that's a good thing. i'm so lost and confused on what to do and i seem caught up on the fact that i really wanted to love it.",advice

"running start to uw cs major i want to get into the uw cs major and am currently doing running start.

\-what courses and pathways should i prioritize to increase chances of getting into the cs major?

\-is there any advantage to completing an associate's degree?

\-should i take time to complete an associate's degree over doing high-level math and physics courses?

\*

\*

after lots of research, i have found that if you want to be a uw cs major as a running start student it is most important that you get the cs major [prerequisites](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/currentuw) finished ([with nearly perfect grades](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/transfer)) so you can enroll for direct admission into the cs major as a freshman because as of 2019 the cs major became a [predominantly direct admission major](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm). you should only go for an associate's degree if you have enough leftover classes after finishing the prerequisites for the cs major with high grades. an associate's degree is good for your resume and working before you get your bachelor's. i don't think most people will work at more than minimum wage jobs until after completing their major anyways, making the associate's degree seem nearly pointless for uw cs majors. after completing the prerequisites it is important to get as many [cs major graduation requirements](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/ugrad/curriculum/cs_reqs_wi22.pdf) as your community college offers as possible to finish the required courses at an easier and cheaper college.

"feeling kinda insecure edit: thank you to everyone who replied and everyone who sent pm’s! i really appreciate all of your kind words and encouragement! after reading through the comments and having some convos with people in my pm’s i think i can say that my problem is more a mental health issue than anything else. one person told me i would benefit from anxiety treatment and while i don’t want to diagnose myself, i think i’m definitely going to seek some sort of therapy or something. i had a long conversation with someone on here and it really just opened a can of worms about my mental health lol. thank you guys so much again!!!

from the title it probably seems like i’m insecure about my grades and feeling like i’m behind everyone academically, but i’m actually pretty confident in my intellect. what i am insecure about it the way i dress. lemme explain . . .

ok so i’m a cs major and we all know the stereotypes about cs majors being lazy and dressing in gross t-shirt and jeans. now that’s partially true, but not everyone dresses that way. i, for one, like to dress up whether that’s at school or outside. but for some reason i feel like as a woman in stem i’m judged for it.

a few weeks ago i dressed up a little more than usual. nothing crazy i just put in more effort in my makeup and outfit. i felt so good and was so happy that day until i walked into my cs lecture. a group of guys were looking at me in a way that seemed super judgmental. out of the 120 people in that room i heard at least 25 ish people scoff and stare at my outfit. that doesn’t seem like much but it made me nervous. some of them were girls too which just made me sad. i had a pretty bad panic attack and went home early. that day i went straight home and came back the next day in a plain sweatshirt and jeans.

here’s my dilemma: my mom surprised me with a beautiful and i mean beautiful tote bag that i’ve been wanting for some time. problem is it looks pretty “grown up” and “dressed up”. i feel like people will just make fun of me again and i’m scared to wear it. my mom was so happy to give it to me though it makes me so sad that i’m hesitating to wear it.

why are people just so mean sometimes?

to be safe my backup plan is to study business specifically finance while i only have 7 classes left for the aa degree but i believe i’ll enjoy cm much more.

"how much of a “college experience” can be had living near campus i despise commuting. i commuted this year for financial reasons and wish i didn’t have to. i never have time to finish homework. my only social interaction with uw students was through instagram pages or study groups, and even then, i would leave campus with most of my work unfinished and come home too tired to finish it. i have no time to attend club meetings either. i want to live on or near campus but i am debating whether to dorm or live in a studio. i don’t know anyone who is looking for a roommate for one thing. for another i want to have some semblence of a traditional college experience. i was “homeschooled” from k-12 at a hybrid parent/school system teaching resource center, and never got to develop socially as i would have in a normal school, as it was next to impossible to be anywhere without your parent or someone elses breathing down your back. most people there were neurodivergent (i am as well, but an environment of 100% nds is… something) or religiously fanatic, and that didn’t help things. i made the mistake of doing running start. i spent three years only to come out with 60 relevant credits, no breathing room for electives to fill the gaps between courses at uw, a social environment worse than high school, and crippled mental health. (i never saw my mental health improve faster than the period immediately after i left community college) i am technically a junior but in standing i am a sophomore. i desperately want to meet people, attend a few parties, and feel like i am part of my university community. at the same time i recognize that hfs provides pretty piss poor value for money, and that a studio would be substantially cheaper than living on campus. there are plenty of options near uw, and it would allow me to stay on campus to work longer, and attend club meetings. it would give me much more privacy and comfort as well. 

how difficult is it to socialize, meet people, or attend social functions living in an apartment compared to living in the dorms? the financial concern is there, but it isn’t too big a concern. i can afford both options, and live with my parents over breaks. ",student life
"a tool to authenticate your class discord! i've just graduated a few weeks ago. however i created an open sourced tool during my independent study for a professor's class discord.

as uw starts the first week via online, i believe that this may be helpful for students who are creating their online class discord communities. this tool authenticates students using their uwnetid. upon authenticating, they will be given a predefined role in the class discord. the role may be used to grant additional access to the server. this is so that that only students and/or other uw affiliated people with a uwnetid may access their class discords. there is an optional logging mechanic which may also be used so that the one who created the server may know which student is whom in the server for additional security.

[demo: the process to authenticate into the server](https://preview.redd.it/y40s5sbau5981.png?width=2102&format=png&auto=webp&s=84dbdec42a9fdda3581678731ef1674bf7401240)

for those who are familiar with uw web publishing process, the setup is easy, straight-forward, and are written within the readme.md file of this repository. however i am also able to accept dms on discord if anyone would like to contact be for more questions or info regarding to this project. you may find me on uw discord, endendragon#1337.",academics

"[advice needed] transferring to electrical engineering to computer engineering? hello, need advice :d

i was a direct admit to engrud but was placed into ece (i know it can be used, etc etc but i'm far more passionate about the content covered in cmpe). 

i know people work super hard and get rejected so i am sure it is pretty hopeless but thought i might ask for a second opinion if i choose to reapply:

* gpa: my gpa was tanked with covid and especially phys 12x and family situations - it was absolutely brutal. my gpa is a 3.1 at the moment. >\_<
* cs courses: 
   * i have taken cse 142, 143 (while the grades aren't super high, they are higher than all my other grades by far except vlpa, div, w)
   * cse 190: lab that went with cse 142 and helped with fundamentals
   * cse 390h: i was one of 18 students to take an honors cs course with professor reges where he talked about how cs people approach problems, common issues, etc.
   * cse 331: i was lucky and secured a spot today in this course (i really wanted it and worked super hard to get into it with my petition, emails, etc)
   * cse 373: also taking this course this quarter with kevin lin - so far, i really enjoy the content.
* research
   * i am currently a member in a research lab of 100+ people and have quickly became a high ranking technical writer with grant proposals being funded for the lab.
   * i am also the finalist in two competitions for a project i'm working on (i am working with 1 other but i am definitely pulling my own weight for the competitions). it is quick possible this project is becoming a startup within the next month, in which case i will be a startup leader? that's wild.
* extracurriculars
   * i am currently the director of a hackathon that is later this year and leading committees, securing sponsors, obtained mlh status, etc. i have spearheaded this.
   * i am an ece ta where i work with assignments, exams, course materials, etc.
   * i have continuously worked since sophomore year in high school and have worked at a grocery store since the start of covid for 20hrs a week
* internship
   * i am desperately trying to get one and just got the book cracking the coding interview to assist with interviews
* family
   * i have a disabled sibling that i also help my family care for 3 days a week. :)
* high school stuff
   * fbla president and 4 statewide awards and national finalist
   * asb treasurer, link crew, nhs, tri-m honor society
   * 3.7 gpa and then 4.42 gpa weighted
   * 12 ap courses with scholarship with distinction twice, even during covid senior year
   * orchestra
   * a killer personal statement

i have very strong writing skills so i am sure my personal statement would be as good as possible - but i do not feel my application is enough (will it ever be?) i only discovered my passion for cs when i got to uw and i am so annoyed - i feel i was a stronger applicant back before covid, when i applied to uw (but regrets dont help) 

if there is no chance for uw cs or cmpe, i am strongly considering switching to uwb csse which has coursework that aligns with things i very much would enjoy ...

one path is the quiz one, with canvas quizes to determine your grade, the other is the research and writing one with prompts and writing assignments.

"re: what keeps you going? i made effort in typing my long af response, but then op deleted their post. :< 

hence this post now exists. y'all can drop your tips and aspirations and whatever else below too! maybe some of you guys can end up being friends in the comments and whatnot--that would be neat. anyways, how have y'all been? i haven't posted here since graduating so uh... ye!

**tl;dr: self-reflection, addressing stressors within my control, making things easier for future me (and then thanking past me), reducing screen time, making my bed, and trying to get to bed at a reasonable time.**

senior year was really rough for me... aside from general stress of being sleep deprived and attempting to barely manage my courseload, i had a pretty awful break up; the place i worked at was closed down thanks to uw's upper management; the restaurant i started working at afterwards closed down after three months thanks to covid; and lastly, i had the honor of being part of the 1st graduating covid class with all the profs scrambling and having no idea how to really teach online or handle our senior projects that was basically required to be in-person to have any sort of value... xd

honestly, not much kept me going and i basically hit rock bottom. i really wanted to drop out multiple times during senior year, but knowing all the physical/mental/financial sacrifices i (and my parents) made for the sake of my education stopped me from doing so even though each day felt like hell (and i did heavily debate on yeeting myself... still a work in progress...shhh).

anyhow, there's no need to pretend to be okay. in fact, it's totally fine and normal to not be okay, especially given current circumstances going on in our world. your feelings are very valid. personally, what's been keeping me going is uhhh... bruh, idek--most of the time, i'm just barely scraping by. i guess i have a lofty goal of retiring early (~35-40 y/o) one day to figure out what i actually wanna do with my life because i still got no idea... perhaps i'll write/illustrate some children's books or maybe open a cozy bookstore/cafe/bar/makerspace or volunteer at a library or plant nursery or maybe do all of them?! the possibilities are endless if you got time (and access to money/resources depending on what you wanna do).

as for how i've been coping, i been trying to reduce screen time outside my job, spend more time doing arts & crafts, check in with myself through journaling/self-reflection, take walks in nature when possible, and make a point to make my bed each day before i sleep (so future me will appreciate it)! i been also getting into plant propagation and seeing plants in my vicinity indoors has been making me feel a bit better overall. :)

when things get too overwhelming, i'll write down everything that's been stressing me out, whether it's in or out of my control--and if it is within my control, what i can do about it now and make a plan as to how to go about to tackling it. now, the hard part is generally executing it and i got nothing for you on that aside from developing your self-discipline, making the task look less daunting by divvying it up to even smaller parts (e.g. write an essay = turn on laptop, login to account, read the essay prompt in full, research topic & gather relevant resources, write outline, write first paragraph, etc.), or just forcing yourself to do it for a minimum of 15 minutes (usually starting is harder that actually doing it imo)... the easier you make it for future you, the more likely you'll do it. :')

anyways, i believe in ya op (and the rest y'all too)!! just a few more months and the weather should be less gloomy and all of you will have either graduated or gotten through another year!! :d

p.s. maybe also take some vitamin d supplements cause how little sunlight we get in the winter months. :')",advice

"why there are no resubmissions in cse 143 (hunter schafer)? i am not sure why they are not offering resubmissions and simulated exams this quarter. because in the previous quarter's (hunter schafer, au 21) course website says that the course had resubmissions and not-real exams. 

also, i took cse 142 the previous quarter, and it had resubmissions and simulated exams. because of those two factors, i succeeded in this course.

if this quarter does not have resubmissions and simulated exams but previous quarters did, isn't it unfair that students who studied quarters with resubmissions have a higher chance to get the desired grade than the students who studied quarters without resubmissions and simulated exams? moreover, when it comes to admission to cs major or any other major, they will only consider grades, not professors taught in that particular quarter.

in addition, the ""additional offering of cse143 available"" email, specifically says that this course (with hunter schafer) will run independently of the current course (with stuart reges). but in reality, they both have the same grading system, no resubmission policy, and in-person exams.

"has anyone ever been “reported” to the communications chair? what usually comes of that? a summary of what happened that lead to it:

every week we have about 3 readings and 4 assignments every week. this week, in addition to those assignments and readings we also had a paper due. two days before the paper was due i sent him an email and asked him about if in next class we could have a group discussion and see about possibly not having to do one of those assignments only the next week that we have a paper due, since this week was a bit overwhelming and i was wondering if it was the same for other students or if it was just me. (the initial email i sent him was super chill, and reading it you could tell it was just a student who was stressed out).

when he responded, his first sentence was “i’m not sure what you’re trying to convey in this email but,” then listed out 1-5 (like a literal list) how this is the collage life and i need to get used to it, i should have said something when the assignment was given, i’ve had the syllabus so i should have planned ahead, etc. etc. and i’m summing it up so more went into it, but the way he worded things, he was clearly talking down to me and i felt like i was being belittled.
so i replied (angerly, i’ll admit) about how i didn’t see why he needed to talk down to me, i was just asking about a possibility, and i have other classes with other assignments and i simply wasn’t able to plan how overwhelmed i’d be, i thought i could handle it. i have only a quarter left in my senior year you know?

bottom line, he didn’t like my response and said his “writing style and how he choose to convey things is his choice” and he will not let me talk about this situation next class (i said i wanted to get other students feelings about the assignments) and that he reported me to “the chair of communication and academic advisor”

so i’m just wondering.. does anyone know what’ll happen?

edit: i also want to add after he told me he reported me, he said “good luck on your paper” and i’m kind of worried to submit things to him now and that this issue is going to affect my grade. so i haven’t turned it in yet (he actually extended the due date to tonight because 2 other students asked)",advice

"therapy resources for students i’ve been falling into neative feedback loops over things i can no longer control. i feel horrendously socially stunted. i had a pretty good childhood, but i feel like my parents made certain choices that artificially limited my growth. i’ve missed out on so many milestones most people have in high school, and a lot of social milestones i met in high school are things that most people meet in elementary school. i’m really unhappy with the path i took into college. i feel like i could have had choices in what i studied and where i went, but had to settle with the one decent school that would take me, and the only open major that interested me, because i squandered my ability to get into closed majors in running start. as a mixture of covid, i feel like i missed out entirely on the first stage of adulthood. i thought i’d prefer living at home, but i feel like not dorming has put me even further behind my peers who are at least starting to live independently. i realize it’s meaningless in the grand scheme of life, but i really wish i gave myself a traditional freshman experience to make up for all the traditional milestones i didn’t meet in k-12. i don’t really want to dorm next year because i’d feel weird about doing it as a 21 year old. i know many people had shitty dorm experiences, but most of my friends are having a lot of fun with that traditional experience, and it makes me feel left out sometimes.

i keep falling into negative feedback loops like this one. they are triggered by the most mundane of things and when they are triggered i have no way to consciously control them. i only stop spiraling through equally mundane things, like  the sunlight looking particularly nice, or having a good time with a friend.  i’m tired of pitying myself, trauma dumping on friends, and ranting on reddit. i want to see a therapist. i don’t want to on my parents insurance because a lot of the things i’ve been falling into negative feedback loops over were in part their choices, and i don‘t want to upset them. this isn’t like when i was suicidally depressed in high school where i could chock it entirely as me wanting to deal with chemical imbalance. i also am considering a career as a commercial pilot, and any mental health diagnosis has the potential to be disqualifying. are there any confidential resources i can see that are either cheap or free? i have a couple thousand dollars saved but i have no idea how many sessions that gets me",student life

"bruh y’all are rich (y’all as a generalization) 

i thought people weren’t serious when they said most students at uw could afford to live on campus. so far, almost every person i’ve met lives on campus. 

anyway, i did cashiering today at noodle, as opposed to my usual prep job, and i was shocked. 

almost every single student had $800+ dollars on their husky card. 

like, i’m assuming it’s not the exact same exchange rate as usd, it’s just husky money, but damn! the rich people at this school can afford to have anything they want, whenever! 

i’m not saying it’s bad to be rich, i’m just shocked by how different uw is from cc. like, most students don’t work and go to school. most students live on campus. most have 100s of dollars a quarter for high quality food. 

uw is a culture shock for me, in terms of wealth. anyone else relate to this?

edit:

i do know many people take out loans to live here, i was just noting how many people i have met that have been so casually wealthy that they don’t seem to process it. this post is not about scholarship loan students.  

for example, several people in my class told me how their parents pay for their entire tuition and everything else for them. again, not bad, but i just felt so surprised by how common that is here. it’s interesting to me.

double edit: 

once again, i’m directly referring to the casually wealthy students i see. the canada goose jackets, the patagonia coats, the lv wallets. 

all my food is from work or the food bank, i am a low income student observing the environment i have been placed in. if that is offensive to you, that’s fine.

"is it a bad thing to go into an open major? so this has been something i've been dwelling on for a while as i intended to go into jsis and obviously the general(?) major has changed to be open.

overall i don't think it's necessarily a big deal, but my parents + sis do and are warning me against going into something and that because i'm at the uw, i should try to go into a major that's more competitive. of course it's not helped that my parent is an engineer and my sister went into a similar direction

on the other hand i spoke to an advisor about it and said it didn't necessarily matter, but tbh i'm really struggling dealing with such differences in opinion and it worries me.

so is going to an open major a bad idea or does it not really matter for a future career (please answer honestly)?",advice

"something that i’ve come to the realisation of regarding college it’s pretty much all hard work and no play. i can’t really cut corners because then i’m not satisfied with my understanding and application of the material. i have to put in the work even if it is uncomfortable. most of my life i got by with my intuition and natural intellect, but now everyone at college is pretty much that way, and i have to make sure i keep up with the school of fish even if it doesn’t mean i necessarily stand out. and even if i am a da to my major and heard that once people get in then they relax when it comes to studying and grades, i just feel a personal obligation to make sure that i put in the full work and make sure i at least am above a 3.5. because i’m one of the few people in my extended family pursuing a bachelor’s degree and pretty much everyone is counting on me. (yeah i’m mestizo, and my dad always says my ancestors were hard-working people.)

when it comes to core classes for my major, my grades range from 2.7 upwards (as is the case for average grades regarding the core cse, phys, and math classes, i don’t know how some students can beat the curve), but all my other grades (like for vlpa, i&s) are all above 3.5. i feel that it’s because while my general knowledge in other subjects is quite strong, my core knowledge needs to improve a little. and even if i have the option to drop my lowest scores, or that exams and final grades are curved up, i should still put in my best effort.

just a realization i came to, seeing that pretty much everyone around me has internalized this mindset and i felt it’s time i shook off my sheltered complacency and adopt it as well.

"uw ms in data science (msds): a review i have not found many places to review the uw masters in data science program on the internet, so figured it might belong here. note: msds during covid may not be what it once was or what it might be in the future.

if you majored in cse at the uw and expect the same level of quality in your masters do not apply to msds. the program has largely **not** met expectations and many of my peers feel the same way. 

teaching: boring, slow, with (sometimes) less qualified professors.  
expecting this program to be connected to cse uw i imagined some overlap between the cse professors and data classes, this was not the case. i understand that uw cse has its own masters, however many professors dont even come from uw itself, with the ones that do coming from the stats and biostats departments. many of the lectures i experienced were 4 hour slogs in which the msds discord was alight with people joking to pass the time and planning where they were going to get dinner. some even expressed that they teach themselves most topics through khan academy...   
for a major which is part stats and part computer science this program does not bring enough computer science faculty onboard, considering it is attached to the uw name.

community: vibrant, fun, interesting  
on the upside, msds has amazing cohorts, people are excited to join and network but also plan fun nights out. something that surprised me when i joined was that there were only around 5 people actually from uw in the program, with many coming from overseas or out of state. generally nothing bad to say about the students, all of them are bright and passionate.

i dont want to spend time slandering uw msds or its faculty, i wish this review only to point out the discrepancy between uw's amazing cse department and what i feel to be an underdeveloped data science program. uw msds attaches itself heavily to the uw name but the courses dont have any uw cse professors or use the same cse buildings for lectures, in reality the only connected cse event we have are the recruiting fairs, which have largely been decimated by covid. 

i hope this review becomes useless when uw decides to invest in its msds program more but i want masters students to know what they are paying for when deciding to give up 35k in tuition.

are there any apartments nearby that are kind of like dorms in the way that you interact with a large amount of people living near you? realistically if i get an off campus apartment i am going to be as lonely as i am now, just lonely in the u district instead of edmonds. i've tried attending clubs but the clubs meet too infrequently to realistically lead to friendships, or are online. most people at clubs already seem to have social bubbles they don't want to break out of, and tbh at that point i don't see the point of going. making friends in classes is pretty hit or miss. i don't really get invited to anything except one on one dinner/lunch every so often which isn't really enough social stimulation for me.

"i’m tired of failing but if i don’t fix this i’m throwing in the towel on life transfer student/junior/history department 

i don’t know where to start with any of this other than to say i feel hollow and like a sham.

i know i’m better than all of this but i just don’t know how i got here. i used to be so passionate and energetic. i was a mediocre high school student but really took off in speech & debate. i received good grades at my first college and did decent through the first part of the pandemic but everything changed after i left campus and then left my parent’s house to live on my own.

i lived with sociopaths, meth-heads and dying old people. i’ve slept in a nook in the wall, i’ve slept in the cold, i’ve gone to sleep hungry.

i’ve dealt with both bipolar and adhd throughout my life and while i’m now medicated, and living in a safe environment with some close friends i still can’t fucking make it work.

through most of all of this i’ve been working at a grocery store and i think it’s eating away at my soul. the crazy people, the anti-vax/anti-mask crowd, snooty and condescending upper class white people, the incompetent management and the physically-intensive labor have all been draining on me. 

but i need to pay rent and eat food (financial aid luckily covers my tuition). and those are getting more and more expensive over time it seems.

my transcript since last winter has been abysmal. a couple xs, one ns, and one whole quarter just absolutely failed (last quarter). i’ve been able to discuss a lot of my struggles and get some leeway and really appreciated assistance from advisors and counselors to be able to continue this quarter. but i just can’t seem to find the energy or patience or even mental well-being to study anymore it seems. i just lay in bed a lot of the time or just sleep because i’m so tired and depressed and i feel almost removed from my surroundings and like there’s thick barrier between me and the world right in front of me. i cry, i sleep, i stare into nothingness. it’s so tragic because i’m such a curious and fairly learned person in the subjects i study and have a yearning to go on to more, complete research and finish well but why can’t i seem to actually do any of it? it’s like i keep getting back on the horse only to fall right off.

i resent all of this because i continue to doubt myself and feel like i’m not actually equipped or intelligent enough to be here. 

i feel like an absolute failure and i think i want to just give up. not just school but i mean everything.

i write this with the second exam due for a class tomorrow when i haven’t even done the first or attended a lecture since the first day and it seems like the professor has a strict exam policy and allows no make-ups without medical or university excuse. i’m already on academic probation from my previous quarters.

i’m tired of failing and i know i’m better than this but i don’t know what to do.

i feel like my entire life is on the brink of falling apart and i just might throw myself into the lake. i’ll never reach my goals and all of this feels like a lofty escapade i was never cut out for because i’m lazy and stupid and sad.

"clue tutors/clue tutoring center--prestige over help?? hi everyone. i've never had super negative experiences with the clue tutoring center, but this quarter has been particularly awful and there's a couple of tutors that don't know anything sadly, or they don't want to teach or care to do so. they also have a very negative way of teaching, and they assume that the student should know everything in a problem. for example, my friend asked them a simple molarity problem and one tutor couldn't even solve it, and yes she did apologize, but she claimed to not know the answer or have any notes to help, and she suggested to go to the professor. then why are we visiting the tutoring center? she also shows a lot of attitude and rolls her eyes multiple times, idk why. i went to her and asked her simple questions about naming carbonyls, and she claimed that it was too far back in her knowledge base to teach it?? i have nothing against you not knowing something, but if they don't know the simple facts, then i don't know why they are hired. i also went to one for physics calculus based, and they said that they were tired and didn't feel like teaching. he said that he had too many other students to cater to. ok, i understand that you have a job, i have one too, but can you please teach. also, whenever i ask a question, they say things like ""you seem to have a grasp on it, and i need to get to another student,"" within 12 minutes of the session, with only 2 in the waiting room. no matter how polite or curious about a topic i seem to be this happens. i don't understand the point of having a tutoring center if the students don't seem willing to teach or help out a little bit. or if there's not enough tutors. like if you don't know about the topic, the least you can do is guide the students where to go. guess i better go back to visiting the tas in long lines or watching youtube. it's so hard to get help at this university.

&#x200b;

edit: thanks for the advice everyone. i waited 1 hour and 30 minutes and was the third person in line for clue in a tutoring session for a specific stem subject. then i went to mgh in person, and there was a 45 minute wait. at 9 pm when i went into the virtual, back in my dorm, no one opened the session. this was a waste of my 2 hr+ time, i've given up on them.

i am a senior in washington state, and i have applied to uw.

i was about a 3.8 student pre-covid, but then i tanked to a 3.3 after covid. it’s my senior year in high school, so it’s practically impossible to raise my gpa. my sat is nowhere near where i want it to be since my school literally didn’t prep any of the students. when i applied to uw, my grade 11 marks were oh-so poor, and i can’t help but regret ever succumbing to my anxieties and depression. mental health issues are nothing new to me and they’ve never interfered with my grades, but covid really tested me. 

now, i feel like my grades have replaced my face when it comes to college applications because it seems to be grades first, and then me. there are a handful of colleges who would reach out and give me a chance of redemption when it comes to grades, but unfortunately those chances are unlikely. 

is it possible to still make a good candidate for uw, or just any college in general? 

my essays for uw have potential to makeup for the poor grades as i talked about my diverse background, mental health, and school during the pandemic. maybe that will be sufficient, but i’ll never know …!

>  
>i came to the uw intending to study cs, but after two rejections i  decided to cut my losses and major in physics (an open major at the  time). i wasn't sure how much my major would hold me back, but i tried  to get as much experience as possible to make up for it. by the time i  reached my senior year, i had two internships at a no-name startup, an  on-campus webdev job, and a data science-related research assistant  position in a on-campus lab. this new grad cycle, i had \~20% callback  rate on applications. i received offers from blue origin, credit karma,  amazon and meta, and i had final interviews with several other companies  (google, stripe, akuna capital, robinhood, walmart).  
>  
>to get an offer, you need to  
>  
>1. get the interview  
>  
>2. pass the interview  
>  
>getting interviews involves a lot of luck, but there's a lot of things  you can do to increase your chances. before you have any paid dev  experience at all, get as many relevant ecs and projects on your resume  as possible. research assistant positions, ta positions, club leadership  positions, involvement in project clubs, etc will help your callback  rate when applying for your first internship. learn full stack  development and build a few simple apps/sites/games from scratch. use  best practices, document them well, host them on github pages or heroku  and put them on your resume. try to get the highest gpa you can, as many  companies still filter by this, but once you have some experience most  companies don't care about it.  
>  
>next, get as much paid development experience as you can (even a minimum  wage job at a no-name startup will significantly increase your callback  rate). competitive companies will expect new grads to have at least 1-2  internships by the time they graduate. polish your resume, apply early,  and get referrals (clubs, blind, and cs discord channels are great  sources for these). if a company you'd like to work at doesn't respond  to your online app, try cold emailing a recruiter (this is how i got a  meta interview). you'll probably need to apply to 100-200+ places to get  your first internship, but having even one internship will make future  app cycles significantly easier. having internship/projects/ecs on your  resume is especially important if you're not a cse/info major, since  they can't assume that you know anything based on your major alone.  
>  
>once you've got an interview, the only thing that matters is how well  you perform. your performance is determined by leetcode prep,  communication skills, behavioral answers, and possibly system design.  for the technical skills you need, take cse 373 (data structures and  algorithms for non-majors). cse 143/cse 373 cover most of what you need  to know for technical interviews. after taking (or self-studying) these  classes, learn the common patterns in interview questions by reviewing  grokking the coding interview. you don't need to buy the course, as much  of the material can be found for free on blogs and other sites. next,  work through the blind 75 list of leetcode questions. this covers most  of the types of questions you'll be asked in an interview, and being  able to solve these questions is enough for 90% of interviews out there.  when you have an interview coming up, complete the most common tagged  qs for that company on leetcode. some companies (like google) change up  their qs a lot so this isn't that helpful when interviewing with them,  but other companies (like amazon and meta) will often ask questions  copied directly from their lc tagged list. if you have an interview with  a company that asks system design questions, review grokking the system  design interview beforehand. most importantly, practice your  communication skills in mock interviews (you should pretty much always  be talking as you're coding) and prep good behavioral stories. companies  don't just want leetcode monkeys, they want people have have good soft  skills and can work on a team.  
>  
>anyway, that's my brief guide to getting a swe job with an unrelated  degree. hopefully it helps some of you who are interested in tech but  aren't in cse/info. not being a cs major honestly doesn't change much  about the process, it's just more difficult to get your first internship  and you'll have to self-study a bit more.

"uw or in-state? hello y'all! i was recently accepted by the uw as a pre-sciences major. i have kind of a debate in my head right now though because of it. while uw is my top choice and i would absolutely love to go (i fell in love with the school and seattle as a whole when i visited), i'm coming from colorado with little financial aid and because of how majors work i can't be sure if i'd be able to get into a more lucrative major later on to justify the price. meanwhile i am much more likely to get into my in state school (cu boulder) with better prospects in terms of price and major. so ultimately i'm torn between staying in state and playing it safe or going to uw and risking more but potentially having a better, more satisfying, and more passionate experience that could stay with me for a long time. my question is: if i get into my in state school with the major i applied for, should i still go to uw regardless of the potential risk to have a more satisfying college experience or should i just stay here? and i suppose a side question would be is it possible to still get into a decently lucrative/popular major at uw as a ""pre-whatever"" admit without having to push yourself to the limits? thank you for any advice that you all may give and if i end up choosing uw i hope to have a fantastic college experience with you :)",advice

(2) **santa clara university** — admitted for biology, grade inflation, but no r1 research status or much name recognition. would go there freshman year while trying to transfer

"questions - college decisions (update)  

hello everyone,

i hope you are doing well! i think i posted this question on this discussion before, but i want to receive people’s thoughts as certain things have changed monetarily. so currently as a high school senior, i have narrowed my choices down to uc berkeley eecs (direct admit) and the university of washington’s cs program as a direct admit (my in-state school).

previously, everyone advised me to choose uw due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently i learned that i was accepted for the regents and chancellor’s scholarship at berkeley. this scholarship now makes uw and berkeley cost the exact same for me. however, i am still having trouble deciding which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. the only reason i am considering staying in-state with uw is that as a dual enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, i will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with uw cs. at berkeley, i understand that eecs is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that i may have to attend university for 4 years instead. 

i know some may think this is a clear-cut choice, but i was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. for example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (i have heard from many that experience matters more than education)? what are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? overall, if cost isn't a factor, what would make you choose one over the other?

"i'm considering the uw and have a few questions about the major system hey guys, i'm going to be an incoming freshman next school year and the uw is one of my two choices i'm deciding between. i'm in-state so it's cheap, i love the campus and i'm from seattle so i already am familiar with the area. the only thing that deters me is the capacity constrained major system.

i applied for cs and engineering and didn't get into either (i didn't expect to at all, i understand how competitive it is). i know it's virtually impossible to transfer in later on and i'm not going on a wild goose chase for that so i looked into other options. the uw offered some cs alternatives i could consider, and the main ones i would like to go into are acms (data science & statistics), applied math, informatics, or statistics. 

now, i assumed that since these were offered as alternatives in the colleges of arts & sciences it would be relatively easy to get into one of these, even thought they were capacity constrained. i looked into it, and the recent acceptance rates for all of these hovered around 30% (or lower)! i guess my question is, how do i know what prerequisites to complete if i only have a small chance of getting into any of these majors? i know i'm fearing the worst, but i'm so afraid of completing the necessary pre-recs for these programs and getting denied from all of them - what do i do then? do i have to redo all my pre-recs so i can go in a different direction? i feel like i'm overthinking this or looking too much into it, any answers to my questions are much appreciated :') sorry for the long frantic post",advice

"uw major system and registration master guide as we entering the second half of the spring quarter, lots of you may already committed to uw. **first of all, congratulations! i am very proud of you getting accepted by uw!** now i am going to give more insights on how the major system and registration at uw work. 

&#x200b;

# 1. major system

**1.1 types of majors** [all majors](http://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) at uw can be categorized into five levels:

**level 1 (open)**: you can declare the major ***anytime*** as long as the cumulative gpa is above 2.0.

* **level 2 (minimum requirements)**: you need to complete the required prerequisites with an overall gpa of 2.50 and higher, and the cumulative gpa is also 2.00 or higher.
* **level 3 (less selective)**: the least competitive type of capacity-constrained majors. in addition to the requirement on prerequisites, you have to complete additional application or essay prompts. ***majors at this level usually have an acceptance rate above 50%***.
* **level 4 (moderately selective)**: most of the stem majors at uw fall in this level, which ***the acceptance rate is less than 50% but above 20%***. very similar to level 3 majors, but you need to earn ***stellar grades (above 3.7)*** to guarantee the acceptance.
* **level 5 (most selective)**: for any majors with ***an acceptance rate under 20%, unless you have an extraordinary gpa (3.9+) with unique ps and cv, i would not suggest you wasting quarters to apply***. if you still wish to pursue similar paths, please try to get the prerequisites done so you can apply for level 3 or level 4 majors. 

&#x200b;

**1.2 some of the commonly applied or heard majors:**

* biology - level 3
* computer science/engineering - level 5
* applied mathematics - level 5
* engineering - level 3 or 4 (depends on your path)
* psychology - level 3 or 4 (vary by quarter)
* education (eco) - level 3 (4 if you're a sophomore)
* statistics - level 4
* mathematics - level 4
* english - level 2
* acms - level 5
* political science - level 2
* informatics - level 4 (vary by quarter)
* economics - level 3 or 4 (vary by quarter)
* any foster - level 4

&#x200b;

**1.3 tips on declaring majors:**

* if you're ***not*** dtm (direct-to-major) or dtc (direct-to-college) but ***dreaming for level 4 or 5 majors***, please have at least one level 1 or 2 major planned. undergraduate is your best time to explore different academic interests.
* if you come to uw with ***more than*** ***30 transfer credits*** (2 quarters equivalency), you're expected to declare a major ***by the winter quarter of your second year***. otherwise, a registration hold will be placed on your account until a major is declared, according to the [105-credit rule](https://registrar.washington.edu/registration/policies-procedures/).
* run your dars (**d**egree **a**udit and **r**eport **s**ystem) featured on myplan periodically to check your academic progress. when in doubt, do not hesitate to seek for help, even for level 1 or 2 majors.

&#x200b;

# 2. registration

in november, you will have your first registration at uw as an enrolled student. and the registration is always a pain to rant about. here i am providing some strategies on how to painlessly register for your classes.

&#x200b;

**2.1 your registration date**

you can see your registration for the upcoming quarter during week 4 of the current quarter on myuw. and your [registration date (winter 2023 as an example)](https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-priorwi23/) is based on your [class standing](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/undergraduate-class-standings/), **not year at uw**. if you don't pay attention, do not worry. you can simply look it up by typing on the searching bar on your browser:

https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-prior**\[quarter\]\[year\]**/

* \[quarter\]: **au - autumn**, **wi - winter**, **sp - spring, su - summer**
* \[year\]: **last 2 digits of the calendar year (e.g. 22 as 2022)**

&#x200b;

**2.2 registration periods:**

* period 1: friday of week 6 to sunday of week 8
* period 2: monday of week 9 to the last day before the upcoming quarter starts
* period 3: the first week of the upcoming quarter
* **note that the registration for period 2 and 3 starts at 00:00 midnight, not 06:00 am! for example, if period 1 registration for autumn 2022 is may 6th to june 19th, then period 2 registration starts at 00:00 on june 20th!**
* **incoming freshmen are registering for fall classes during the a&o, so please ignore the period 1 restrictions if autumn 2022 is your first quarter at uw.**

&#x200b;

**2.3 platform**

use **sln page** to register. myplan sometimes drive people crazy.

&#x200b;

**2.4 check the requirements & restrictions**

before the registration starts, please **check** whether you satisfied the requirements or not. the most common are:

* you need to be in certain majors to register during period 1, 2, or 3
* you need to a certain class standing to register during period 1, 2, or 3
* you need either 0.7 (d-), 1.7 (c-), 2.0 (c), 2.2 (c+), or 3.0 (b) to be eligible for advanced courses
* you need to be matriculated student **(45 uw credits)**

&#x200b;

**2.4.1 example (mgmt 402): major & class standing restrictions**

[mgmt 402 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/eovpphiqtsv81.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9fc67e2b1842047fe1df1da7f0cae871037dd2)

to be eligible for mgmt 402, you need:

* have 90 or more total credits earned (junior status)
* admitted to foster, or you must wait until june 20th or your registration date

&#x200b;

**2.4.2 example (math 125): major & class & prereq restrictions**

[math 125 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/5484bjvkvsv81.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=300ed8a17e907f0a741fc264f5fffd500982cefd)

[math 125 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/t212eybnvsv81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=0605bcee18452dd2d35d88947995ff88e7380f75)

to be eligible for math 125, you need:

* finish \*math 124 or have equivalent ap/ib exam scores
* not in math, stat, or acms majors
* **the ""cancellation in effects"" means that if you ended up a 1.9 and lower on math 124, the registration system will remove you from math 125 when the grade is posted.**

\*math 124 has no prerequisite unless you took math 120 (need 2.5+).

"uw nursing and community college nursing programs just wanted to give some information to anyone wanting to attend uw for its nursing program. i made a post about two years ago talking about my experience with nursing prerequisites at uw and getting rejected from the uw nursing program twice (you can go back and look at my post). 

after getting rejected from uw nursing the second time, i started applying to associate degree programs in the seattle metro area, including north seattle college, seattle central college, south seattle college, shoreline community college, and lake washington institute of technology. i got into the associate degree in nursing program at lake washington institute of technology in fall 2020 and will be graduating this june. for anyone who is worried about not being able to get a certain job or get into a hospital position without a bachelor’s in nursing, those fears are unfounded. with a year or so of hospital experience as a nursing assistant and while i am still enrolled in school, i was able to get a job offer with two different hospitals in their nurse residency programs. i don’t even graduate for another two months and i am not even enrolled in a rn-bsn program yet, and i still got hospital job offers. 

what this means for current and prospective uw students looking to study nursing is this: uw nursing is not the only option for getting your nursing degree, and community colleges are an amazing option to pursue your nursing education. you will most likely be able to get a job in a hospital before you even graduate. with regards to prerequisites, community colleges offer smaller class sizes, it is easier to get better grades (no curves and weird competitiveness), and they are much cheaper (~$3900 per quarter at uw versus ~$1300 per quarter at north seattle college (most wa state community colleges are pretty similar in cost iirc)). the entire cost of my nursing program at lake washington institute of technology was maybe $16,000 over six quarters, plus there were technology grants and scholarships available as well, whereas uw costs around $24,000 over six quarters (correct me if i am wrong). you also do not need to spend a huge amount of money attending seattle university or seattle pacific university just to have your bsn degree a few months sooner. community college nursing programs also have application cycles 2 or 3 times per year, whereas uw only has admissions in january once per year, meaning that if you receive a rejection for fall quarter, you can apply again for winter quarter without a problem rather than waiting another ten months to apply again.  

one concern as well many people have about associate degree in nursing programs is that you will eventually have to get a rn-bsn degree. both hospitals i interviewed with told me that they have scholarship programs, both full and partial, to pay for you to get your rn-bsn. you can work full-time as a nurse and complete your rn-bsn, since classes meet (at least at uw bothell) once every two weeks. (i believe seattle children’s does require you to have your bsn for new hires, but i know people who have been working there as a nursing assistant and are able to get a job as a nurse there).

if you are a prospective student looking to come to uw for nursing or even if you are a current pre-nursing student at uw taking their prerequisites, i would recommend looking at taking your prerequisites (or the remainder of them) at a community college to save money, get higher grades without a curve, and have smaller class sizes to develop relationships with professors for recommendations. apply to multiple nursing programs at community colleges and apply every quarter you can, so that you can maximize your chances of getting into one as soon as possible and start your education and career. still apply to uw for nursing, and if you get in you should definitely attend since uw is one of the best nursing schools in the country. but do not sit around and wait a whole other year to try again if you do not get in the first time. i’m sure it changed in the year or so since i applied, but when i applied the first time in 2019, 80 students out of ~700 got in, and the second time i applied in 2020, 80 students out of ~600 got in. don’t put all your eggs in one basket by only focusing on the uw program. you will be an amazing nurse no matter where you go to school as long as you put in the effort and stay curious.

"(giving) info informatics admission advice i collected so much advice about the info application from this subreddit and in real life while i was doing mine this cycle. i got in! which means this advice is probably not awful. so i decided to add to and organize my weird collection of advice from my notes app and put it here for other people to use. if you didn't get in this cycle, or are applying later i hope this helps and good luck! this is my handbook on getting in.

**info application essay advice:**

**present yourself as matching the informatics school mission/values/self-descriptors:**

<i wish i could just put my screenshot here, but refer page 2-3 of this brochure for the mission statement and descriptions. frame yourself in what they describe> [https://issuu.com/uwischool/docs/infobrochure\_2020](https://issuu.com/uwischool/docs/infobrochure_2020)

""a program that focuses on computer systems from a user-centered perspective and studies the structure, behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store, process and communicate information. includes instruction in information sciences, human computer interaction, information system analysis and design, telecommunications structure and information architecture and management.""

its not just tech (cs is about making the best tech), not just people (that’s social sciences), not just information. privacy, security, legal, intellectual property, human factors in tech, web and mobile development, social media, politics, the tech world, statistics, journalism.

make sure its clear you know what informatics is and that **you specifically** fit it (you don’t actually have to know what informatics is, i barely do, so say what they say)

&#x200b;

**this is about you**

what classes or things peaked curiosity, why are you here, what is important to you specifically.

really think about why you like informatics, why did you choose it, what is it about you that will make you good at it.

* i didn't think i cared that much about informatics until i worked on this essay, i realized why i really wanted to get in.

have a focused idea/topic/goal for the essay and make sure it is clear. this i struggled with. the essay prompt is barely a prompt, it's more like things they want you to mention.

topic ideas: (but please use stuff that actually works for you, erase these from your mind before brainstorming)

* how you found informatics, how you found whatever informatics concentration you like, something you struggled with (like communicating your ideas, finding your role, personal stuff) that info helps with, a specific instance, or an experience you had like club/job/volunteer/school.

try to make a story; doesn’t have to be super narrative, but show your growth don’t just brag.

* mine wasn't a single narrative story, i talked about the three times i have done projects about prison advocacy, and used it to show my progression over time getting better at communicating ideas as i got more into informatics.

don’t write it like a paper or resume, its about your connection to it and the humanistic aspects of the program. write it to be understandable for someone who isn’t in informatics, because some of the reviewers (apparently) aren’t informatics people.

""highlight your passion about the subject (could talk about a project you did during info 200/201 and how you wanted to expand on it). see if you can expand on it.""

be yourself and show who **you** are, but don't feel bad about creating a smarter/kinder/girlbossier/informatics version of yourself

&#x200b;

**here’s how i broke down the prompt:**

(but smoosh all the questions together into one story)

**experiences with information**.

how have you used tech/data to help you/others or if you haven't really, how can you using tech/data help the next generation

do you not have “experiences with information technology”? i'm sure there is stuff you can still write about and this is broad enough that i’m sure you have an experience with information, especially related to diversity/equity.

* clubs, personal projects, volunteering, personal relationships, social media, organizations. anything related to information technology or data or the internet could work

but it can’t hurt to find some if what you have doesn’t feel compelling:

* use projects from the info classes you took, making sure that you show how that experience was specific to you or your life to differentiate yourself from everyone else who also took those classes.

get a job/ extracurriculars. maybe it doesn’t have to be super social justicey or perfect, but just to show experience

extracurriculars:

* info viz
* hackathons or computer science clubs/groups
* poduw (polling and open data initiative)
* if you want to do design:
   * huskyadapt; seal lab; design for america
* swe
* other techy rso’s or any rso where you can be the web design/techy person for them
* do volunteer data entry or data related stuff for a non-profit, look at [volunteermatch.org](http://volunteermatch.org/)

i was stressed so really wanted stuff like this to look better. i didn’t end up talking about it in depth but i bet you could get a whole story out of it. i mentioned data entry volunteering for a nonprofit but it was more helpful because i thought of my whole idea from connecting it to the rest of my life.

also remember they don’t fact check you so… go ahead and make it sound cooler than it was

&#x200b;

**experiences with diversity, equity, and inclusion**

not solely focusing on your identity/oppression, make sure its related to how technology played a negative or positive role in it, and then tie it to what you did/want to do to change it (preferably using information technology). it doesn't have to be as related to tech as the last question, but make sure your ""backstory"" actually flows with the whole essay.

possible things

* intersections of your identity
* advocacy
* political exclusion and technological exclusion
* misinformation is something they really care about
* social media

this is the ""human-centered"" part of informatics, show that you care about people and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

&#x200b;

**goals after college**

if you don’t have a specific career goal, approach it as how the major matches with your values and personal goals.

* i talked about combining helping people and advocacy with a logical, practical base. and how moving around a bunch of majors let me know info was good for me in the future

find faculty or a specific class or what about the school that will help further goals, this will make them think the i school is central to your future and you can't get it anywhere else.

* it could help to name drop one of your professors and say you’re interested in their work.
* look into research groups at the i school
   * i talked about wanting to learn about the center for informed public group and masters programs.

info is a backup major for a lot of people, and its also broad enough that it can be a catch-all. convince the reader that info specifically is what you need and want.

“show how you’ve made a positive impact on the world around you and describe how you being an info major will help you to continue on this trajectory""

what is it about informatics and about yourself that will make you stick with this in the future.

&#x200b;

**learning skills**

brag about your grade for a class, and make sure it ties into the rest of the essay. this wasn't super central to my essay approach so i don't have much advice for it; though i'm sure there's a way to make the whole story about your class experience and you coming out with a good grade. they don't care much about your grades so use this as an opportunity to highlight your academic best.

&#x200b;

**general essay advice**

700 words is a short essay, make sure it is straightforward and cohesive (do as i say not as i do) and there's a clear point that you successfully gets across -ask people if it gets across.

reach out to informatics advisors or ta’s or professors

utilize drop in tutoring at study center or use clue

get feedback on what you write, even if you, like me, hate people reading your writing. i am very grateful for my friend who read my first draft and said ""this sh\*t makes no sense, it's making my dyslexia worse"". that hurted, but i needed it.

start early, i thought i started early and still worked on it up to when it was due. start earlier. talk through your ideas with people and get people to read your stuff, then restart- ask early on so it is constructive.

anytime you think about informatics, write it down for later because you can use it. this essay forced me to be very introspective for a while. maybe i am just an over-thinker, but still, brainstorm for a long time. (i did get caught up on trying to use all of it, so be mindful that not everything can be included).

give yourself the best chance with a well written essay. i do think content is most important -i actually had a few typos. (please don't bring it up i'm so embarrassed)

&#x200b;

**a collection of other people’s blocks of advice:**

(this is not cited i am very sorry but i genuinely don't remember who said what)

1:

show how you’ve made a positive impact on the world around you and describe how you being an info major will help you to continue on this trajectory. think of something that’s a big part of your life and talk about how you used it to make a positive impact and if you don’t have anything like that, find something. they care a lot about being passionate

2:

tell a overarching narrative: “for me, i like design, so i explained how i started off in polisci, but i found that it was too theoretical, and not practical. i learned in polisci how inequitable the world is, but no matter the studying i did, i couldn’t change the world around me. then i found design. i could make things to physically change the world around me, and i fell in love. “

be explicit with your previous experiences : “i participated in x rso, and i designed y for z to make it more equitable.” tie it into the overarching narrative. “i made things with my hands, and i saw how much i was able to impact someone’s life for the better, without us, they would’ve faced x inequality.”

be explicit why info: “i learned a lot in x rso, and i learned how much i want to be a designer post college to make the world around me more equitable. informatics will allow me to do that because it offers me x resources, unlike y.”

3:

paragraph 1: talk about a hardship that you have faced - preferably one that is from systemic bias.

paragraph 2: talk about how you persevered, despite said hardship.

paragraph 3: talk about how your perseverance sparked a passion to work on solving that hardship for others.

paragraph 4: talk about how you learned about the ischool while becoming passionate about working on that hardship's solution.

paragraph 5: talk about why you feel the ischool will best help you gain the tools you need to help others with this hardship (since you plan on making this passion your lifelong pursuit). (be specific here. mention a faculty that you feel would be a great resource or mentor because of some specific work (s)he has done. especially if he or her was one of your 200 instructors ***and likes you*** or is on the admission board.)

4:

**tip #1: start your application essay early! this means brainstorming, drafting, and all of the basic writing processes. create a good list in your brainstorming of projects you could talk about or any social experiences that made an impact on you.**

my first essay read like a resume and that was not the key at all. the essay (if the prompt is the same as mine) should be a story about you and a specific experience(s) that where you learned from and applied the views/values/mission of the ischool's pillars.

sure, getting rejected the first time hurt a lot because it increased my anxiety about not having a major. however, the key is to keep grinding and have no regrets. therefore, on my second try, i put in a lot more time and effort. my google doc draft ended up having 40+ pages of notes and drafts that i took over the span of 3 months because i kept editing the same essay. if i got rejected here - then it would still hurt, but i would have no regrets because i did my 100% best on the application. 

**tip #2: a growth mindset is very important. being able to bounce back from failure and be even better is important. put your 100% effort into things and have no regrets about the outcome. expect the worse; but hope for the best.**

i'm still experiencing this mindset right now in my internship interview processes after getting mountains of rejections and no offers. it hurts - but i believe in myself and i'm grinding for my optimism! 

**tip #3: learning how to scope your essay and focusing on specific experiences in my life helped me describe how i implemented the ischool's values into my thinking and learning.** talk about what you've learned from info classes like this class and how you applied that to your future experiences of doing things - work, academics, hackathons, etc.

**tip #4: have a clear goal of what you want to do and communicate your journey with it.** your pursuit of passion should be clear and not vague at all.

tip #5: **understand that the ischool doesn't need their applicants - the applicants need the ischool so make sure to talk about how the ischool's resources will let you reach your goal.** for example, i talked about the possibility of working with specific professors in the tech policy lab and i brought examples of what i learned from info 300 into my work experiences.

**tip #6: take more info classes other than info 200 and info 201.** this step may not be absolutely necessary; but, it can help you understand the principles of informatics as a whole. i took info 300 and the 3 classes alone were able to help me get the major. however, i have gotten tips to take as many info classes as you can so you can talk about how you implemented aspects of what you learned from the class to your story.

**tip #7: make sure your essay is a story about you.** assume that they are going to read your essay one time through because they're tired of reading applications all day. reading boring resumes like my first essay definitely didn't make an impact on them. however, writing a story about myself and my journey towards my goal of ""\[becoming\] an aspiring software engineer... to design empathy-driven technology so information can be universally accessible"" made it clear what i wanted to do.

i literally had my info 300 professor read over my essay and he said it was straight-up boring. the guy literally plugged in the hero's journey chart into my google doc as well and i got traumatic high-school english flashbacks. but it made sense why he did that. 

**tip #8: use as many resources as you can. this means showing your paper to friends, family, professors, tas, the info student admission helpers, the writing center, etc.** they will provide criticism on what is clear, what can be improved, and what should be emphasized. also, make sure to ask for their first impressions because you must hit all of the marks on the dot right from the get-go. ultimately, you don't have to implement all of their feedback, and it's up to you to choose which feedback would be beneficial for your vision because not all of the feedback you get will be constructive towards that target.

**tip #9: try to read the essays of admitted students to see what aspects they emphasize to align with the values of the ischool.** however, take this with a grain of salt because you definitely do not want to copy them. it's your story you're writing about, not theirs.

&#x200b;

**backups for informatics:**

* geographical information studies
* design major
* foster information systems path
* do minor in informatics which isn’t capacity constrained
* panic and pick something random (most majors have a data science concentration)
* do something and then get a masters like the msim or msds
* check the rest of uw reddit there’s plenty of ideas (uw restricting majors is so dumb and its so stupid that we have to think up backup majors when we’re giving them money this school is dumb)

&#x200b;

mandatory disclaimer: this is what worked for me, it might not work for you. maybe this advice isn't even necessary for anyone else but me. try to read a few people's essays or ask what they wrote about to see which approach can work for you.

are there any possible scenarios where the kid's explanation holds water? one thing i can hypothesize is that the kid applied for early graduation (attending ceremony before finishing their last semester; not sure if udub has such an option), attended graduation, then cancelled their last semester before the class drop deadline, ultimately not completing their courses yet.",advice

"where to live: university district vs university village / laurelhurst / ravenna? i (male) will be starting my studies soon at university of washington. i will be living out of campus. i wish to know which is the better place to live among following places?

1. university district
2. university village / laurelhurst / ravenna

university district has much more apartments to choose from, thus i am able to find a cheaper rent. from the videos, it also looks more vibrant with more shops (so more convenient). however, the crime rating is f according to areavibes: [https://www.areavibes.com/seattle-wa/university+district/crime/](https://www.areavibes.com/seattle-wa/university+district/crime/). i heard some horror stories as well around university district.

university village / laurelhurst / ravenna are much safer (b+ crime rating), but the number of apartments are much lesser and more expensive. i also heard that many older people or family with young children living there. much safer, but also much boring.

i am also confused on why the crime rating difference is so big for university district and university village, which is just nearby to each other. any reason for this big difference?

is there a good support system (academically) for students? are the advisors actually good? is there a career advising center? how are the tutors, if there are tutors.

do you suggest working while being a full-time student? i haven't been during the school year but was also taking a very heavy course load. how many hours per week would you say you spend dedicated to school (i'm hoping to be an urban design or sustainable urban development major).

i graduated a while back and now my family owns a house near the ranier beach light rail station. it takes 40 minutes to get to uw station including walking and you only have to take the light rail so you can cram study before class. since it's one of the first stops you always get a seat.

the house is a 3 floor unit in a duplex. you get the master bedroom with a private bathroom with shower, closet, and south facing window to the street so at least there's a nice view for when you contemplate your life choices. the room is furnished with a queen bed, desk, and white board. 

there are two roommates, my cousin (f) and my brother. my cousin is taiwanese and is almost never home. my brother lives on the basement floor and is not very social so you won't see him much either but if you are trying to get into cs you should try to make friends with him because he is a very talented programmer and can help you with your math/physics/cs homework.

i still could not believe what had happened. i am a 6-foot-tall, 220 pounds, masculine guy. and i was in my karate gi, on my way to practice. it was around 6 pm, the platform was full of people.

i would think this will make me the least likely target for anyone to pick up a fight on the street, as well as the worst time, right? nope. this man bumped straight into me and kept aggression toward me for a couple of minutes, in a combat-ready stance.

i tried to break the engagement distance, and kept trying to talk him out of this while retreating in a fully defensive stance. he threats to beat me up, and i was cornered to the end of the platform. i felt adrenaline rushing, and i'm out of choice. lucky the train came just in time, and i am able to get out of there as he did not follow me.

this man is an african american, about 6 to 6 feet 1, 230 - 240 pounds. chubby build, with long beards. his behavior (movement, language) seems a bit off, might be on drugs. please be careful if you see him.

i was scared. he might as well as be armed with a knife, or possibly with a firearm? what if the train didn't come? we would have had a really bad fight--i can feel his hostile intention. i have absolutely nothing on me, except my bare hand. i am a 6 feet, 220-pound man, with martial arts training. but i was still sacred, very.

consider this is mid of the day, and i am not even alone, shits still happen. i felt the need for more self-defense measures. however, after looking through university policy, anything i could think of -- pistol, taser, knives, brass knuckles, batons, pepper sprays. all prohibited. i felt powerless realizing if this happens again, i could do nothing to prepare, and nothing if he choose to harm me.

i am an incoming transfer student for autumn. i am a ece student and the out of state tuition for me is too expensive so i talked to the residency advisor and he said i would be eligible for in state tuition under financially independent bona fide domicile. but the problem is i cannot take more than 7 credits and i have to show that i am financially independent. when i talked to my advisor at ece, they are not allowing me to less than 12 credits or i will get dismissed. the only thing i can do is apply a part time petition form which is something they do not guarantee that i will be able to take less than 7 credits for three quarters. i am in this situation and apparently, i am not eligible for work study program. is there any faculty that i could talk to?",advice

"should i abandon my plan for med school in favor of following my dreams of becoming a teacher? for some context:

i am a junior majoring in biology (i’m switching to biochem soon). i have planned on going to med school since my freshman year of college. however, throughout high school and as a kid i wanted to be a teacher. my mom and dad do not want me to become a teacher because they think i’m “too smart” for that (which is so dumb. there is no such thing as being too smart to be a teacher). i’ve been studying for the mcat and i like medical things especially neurology and pathology, but the more i peer mentor and ta the more i realize that i don’t think med school is my true passion. 

i’ve considered becoming a professor, but i realize how incredibly difficult it is to become a professor. for this reason i’m most likely shooting for high school and teaching some ap. 

here are my pros and cons of becoming a teacher

pros:
following my dreams, done with school after bachelors or masters, i get the chance to make a difference and educate the next generation. 

cons:
parents will be disappointed, extremely low salary, possibly intellectually under stimulating (not to be confused with unchallenging. teaching is challenging)

i’m not saying there is full on segregation at uw, my friend group is a pretty big mix of ethnicities and i actually have a pretty easy time making friends with international students too, but like…it’s prominent enough to notice. considering uw affiliated mentoring programs allow students to pick the race of their mentor, uw definitely encourages this behavior ",student life

# biomedical health informatics track

\*\*\*bhi is a track, so you must be admitted to the informatics major to declare your track. to do this, just schedule a meeting with an info advisor and they'll help you out from there.\*\*\*

these experiences will vary based on your professor and when you take the course. i will rate the classes on difficulty level out of 10, workload out of 10, interesting content out of 10, and whether the class is an easy 4.0. make sure to look up the professors on ratemyprof before registering for the class!

&#x200b;

**bime 300 - transformational technologies for biology, medicine, and health:**

this class was not the most exciting class, but presented some difficulty as there is some programming with pandas and jupyter. this class explored the health systems and the intersections between informatics and medicine. there were a lot of assignments that i found didn't help with learning, and the professor did not go over how to do the code (he just assumed that you would be able to do it because the prereq is info 201). a lot of students felt lost, and a lot of my group-mates straight up did not help with group projects (but this is probably due to being online). the only things graded are reading responses, group projects, presentations, and participation.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* reading responses due tuesdays and thursdays
* oral presentation (tell-a-story). this is very lowkey, you get to choose your topic and story to tell.
* 3 team projects. these involve a coder and a writer, but the professor ended up not balancing this so well with teams. make sure to try and get more than 2 people in a team. from my memory, there is some data handling with thousands of medical data which involves filtering, analyzing clinical notes, and finding genetic data to prescribe medical advice.
* lateness policy on a case-by-case basis, doesn't provide late days for assignments.

difficulty: 6/10

workload: 9/10 \*

interest: 3/10

easy 4.0? more like ez 3.5 - prof is a harsh grader zzz

professor: john gennari

\* lots busy work :( and lots of time teaching yourself jupyter if you have never used it before. i also was assigned as the coder for most of the projects, so i was paired with freshman/sophomores that have never taken a coding course somehow (info 201 is a suggested prereq, not required).

&#x200b;

**info 486 - designing for personal health and wellness:**

i thoroughly enjoyed this course. most work is done with group projects, developing an app to promote personal health and wellness. we get to explore how to make these sorts of apps effective with high usability. the professor was super engaging and accommodating. i definitely felt like i learned the most from this course. it gave a similar learning vibe as info 360, with plenty of time to work with your groups in class.

the labs were definitely the most redundant, but you need to attend for credit.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* reading responses (30%), due before every class (twice a week)
* group project (40%). this is graded by multiple deliverables throughout the quarter.
* individual assignments (15%). written reflection papers, lab assignments.
* participation (15%). this is very loosely graded. i took this online and you only needed to 'react' every once in a while.
* slightly strict with deadlines, but will accommodate with you if there is a good reason.

easy 4.0? yah

professor: erin beneteau

&#x200b;

**bime 435 - informatics in healthcare:**

bime 300 but less code, more app design. the course goes more in depth about the healthcare systems and technology. i honestly can't recall enjoying this course very much, but it followed the basic standards of an info class with developing an app without any programming. the professor is super kind and doesn't grade harshly. labs were mostly recaps/time to work with your groups.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* buying the book is not necessary.
* course topics:
   * the us healthcare system
   * foundations of informatics in healthcare
   * application in clinical informatics
* weekly assignments (35%). quizzes, discussion boards, other assignments. quizzes are fairly easy if you skim the assigned readings.
* labs (35%)
* final project (30%). written and oral reports, had to present with group in front of the class about the project we developed.
* late assignments can be turned in at a cost of a few points (can't earn full credit).

easy 4.0? yessir

professor: andrea hartzler

&#x200b;

**info 478 - population health informatics:**

coding, coding, coding. get ready to use the r language that you learned about 2 years ago. the lecture content was extremely boring to me, and since it was an 8:30 am class, i have to be transparent and say i barely went to class. she recorded lectures so i definitely used panapto to go back when she explains certain topics or assignments. i would honestly recommend *not* skipping lectures, as they were helpful for the assignments. this class is all about data visualization and representation. you have assignment deliverables similar to info 201, as well as a final group project. i honestly don't know how i earned a 4.0, but i'm assuming that if i can do it, so can you :d

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* workbooks (30%) 1pt each every week.
* assignments (35%) 10 pts each, usually every week.
* course project (35%). you begin to work on this around 3 weeks before finals.
* super flexible grading. you can submit late work within a week and still get 100% credit.

# other courses to mention

**info 442 - cooperative software development:**

as you may be able to tell, i'm not a coder by any means. in this class, you get to create a team of 2 developers, 1 product manager, and 1 designer to *cooperatively develop* a web app. this course is similar to info 340 in that you will need to have some experience with front-end development. pm and designer definitely have the easier job. the lectures weren't exactly helpful to the overall project, but it was interesting to learn about how real products are made, including developing pitches, timelines, and program versions.

*for seniors thinking about capstone group formation, a lot of people (including myself and my team) found our teammates for capstone in this class. try to find people with similar project interests as you!*

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* going to class is required - you are graded based on creating your agenda each day with your team (what you accomplished the last week, what you're going to accomplish this week, and any questions you have for the ta/professor)
* labs are super easy activities. you learn about integrity, working with a team. i honestly hope they change the structure of this, it felt like a waste of time as a senior who already learned this 40 times during my time at uw.
* course reading is free and required. i learned a lot from the book and it helped with my understanding in the class. also, if you have your info 340 book, be prepared to keep that tab open.
* assigned and selected readings (14 pts)
* labs (20 pts)
* project assignments (56 pts)
* final presentation (10 pts)
* extra credit is available
* no penalty for late submission of *reading or lab assignments.*

difficulty: 4.5/10 \*

workload: 6.5/10

interest: 3/10

easy 4.0? nope. but a 3.5+ is very doable with minimal effort.

professor: cheri allen

\* difficulty will be based on what role you are. the developers definitely had the harder job, but as the pm, i did my best to support my team and offered extra insight/help.

&#x200b;

**cse 163 - intermediate data programming:**

i'm not a coder. i wanted to avoid cse 143 like the plague. i heard that this class is much easier and i believe this to be true. hunter is a great lecturer and is super engaging, the content that you learn is actually really helpful for other info courses/bhi track courses (you learn pandas, python, jupyter - would be great to take this before bime 300). the final project was definitely my favorite part of the class, we got to present our posters at the end in a fair. the grading is much more lenient, and you get resubmissions. i'd say the format is similar to cse 142, but there are no tests, just graded weekly checkpoints. i learned the best from the lectures, so don't skip those!

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* checkout any cse 163 website, [this](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163/22sp/) is the one from my quarter.

difficulty: 7/10

# ta-da!

that's my personal experience with bhi! i do feel like i learned a lot of valuable skills and enjoyed my time in the program. a lot of the courses go over the same content, but also expanded on more topics with each class i took. i personally didn't realize how much coding there would be, especially in bime 300, but they were manageable.

"academic advice i have decided to write a post based on my personal opinions and those of my classmates in the program as well. hihim is a little known major at uw. hihim, also known as health informatics and health information management is a cahiim accredited program that enables you to take an rhia exam after. now, into the details, when looking at their website it appears to be competitive “we only take 50 students”. 

yes, that’s great but what if only thirty apply? there are about 38-41ish people in the first year hihim classes. ok… so it’s not competitive. classes are mondays and wednesdays when they are made to sound mondays, tuesdays, wednesdays and thursdays from 5-9pm in all application materials to the major. classes are in the evenings which i am fine with, (i did apply to the program after all). classes imply learning and teaching. each class (even the five credit class!) meets one day a week for less then two hours. the five credit class meets from 7:00-8:20 and that’s it. the professor of this class has given 1 lecture in the last 6 weeks. 1 lecture. i paid 2,250 dollars (fee based program) to uw only for the professor to lecture once and have students teach each other the rest of the time.

the other professor teaches two classes, one monday and one wednesday and surprise! the wednesday class is online so i only have one class a week in person. 12 credits that i am paying 5,100 for before student and activities fees and other fees. 

this program would be better if they didn’t hype it up to be amazing only to not teach. the program has such great potential in another format and if the professors lectured. i am very lucky i am good at making myself read the textbooks and study on my own time or i would not have learned anything besides the little bits of material taught by the professors.

i will say, studying is the best way to learn but it’s one thing to teach yourself a couple concepts and entirely different thing to teach yourself for an entire quarter for three separate classes. 

the professors have you teach yourself (a good way to learn!) but never lecture (what are we paying them for?) keep in mind, hihim is a fee based bachelors program so it’s a lot more expensive then the tuition i was paying previously. 

the teachers are inconsistent with assignment formatting and have poorly made slides but expect a lot from assignments. for example, a 4-5 page paper (single spacing, no breaks after paragraphs with cover sheet and apa bibliography with a 2 paragraph summary for each source) was assigned this monday and is due this sunday. 

respect is built on trust. i feel as though i placed my trust in the hihim program and they broke that trust by hyping up the program to be great and then having it all be self taught and homework. it feels like they are making me pay them to teach myself, or alternatively i am paying them 30,000+ dollars for a two year program in which i am teaching myself and not relying on the professors to teach (their job). 

this is in no way meant to be negative, i am merely informing people about the program like i wish someone had informed me. the program has so much potential if the professors actually taught besides assigning readings and presentations for the students to give every single class”

taking gh 482 however would require some serious switching things around in my plan for the next couple years which is risky too given my already tight timeline. but bezruchka has great reviews!

"meeting people and partying outside of greeklife i have a really hard time meeting people in here. i consider myself very extraverted and confident, but it’s been a struggle for me and a skill i had to learn. a lot of the time people are taking classes with friends and not interested in making new ones, and speaking frankly a lot of the student body here is extremely introverted and socially awkward in general. it’s really gotten me down. i tried joining clubs but most of the clubs seem the same way too, people go with friends to do an activity and don’t talk to people they don’t know. i’ve made some friends in clubs but it’s tough because they’re activity rather than social based for the most part. there’s a couple good ones though, but many are really inactive as well as cliquish. they are also extraordinarly limited, for such an outdoorsy city it blows my mind that the winter sports clubs are the only outdoor clubs. (considering joining hws or snow club) i had a lot of interest in the sports clubs, but after tryouts the upsetting fact is that i am not athletic enough for college sports. i can workout and get in shape, but chances are by the time i am in good enough shape it will be too late. i also like partying. i know people always say “just go to house parties” but the fact of the matter is none of my non greek friends are going to parties, and most house parties tend to be a small group of close friends, which is pretty awful for meeting new people. i’ve never been invited to or seen a larger house party. i’m sure i can get invites if i keep making friends but this goes back to the original problem of uw and seattle being tough places to make friends in. the seattle club scene is a national joke unless you want to go to an lgbt club, and the bars i went to on the ave were a miserable experience. i had more fun and made more friends in the line at earls than i actually did inside earls. there’s this one frat that basically begs for guests but if you know who i am talking about you know they are good for nothing except a really good laugh. i rushed this quarter and had an awesome time. i got bids from a few fraternities with guys who’s company i really enjoyed. the fact of the matter is that it’s a huge commitment, and before making it i want to be 100% sure about the choice. are there any other alternatives to a social framework that i should take a look at? any clubs i should consider joining? i’m a hella outdoorsy guy, big on hiking, photography, backpacking, that sort of thing.

"21 year old possibly autistic dude looking for someone to go on a mock date with me, will compensate weird place to do this but it is what it is. i’ve had basically no experience my whole life. i’ve been on five dates my whole life, one of which was kind of a hookup from here but it didn’t go great for either of us. i’ve had female friends, some of whom are close, but not too many i have an easy time talking to people in most contexts (struggle with parties) but i have a very small circle of close friends in general. sex and dating comes so easy for my peers, and i just don’t see what i am doing wrong. i am clean, in above average shape, very fashionable, and live a pretty interesting life with a bunch of hobby’s. there is nothing wrong with me at the surface level, but i think i have some energy underneath that makes women, and maybe also guys, uncomfortable. i suspect that i may be autistic, and that i struggle with certain kinds of social activity for a reason. i’m hoping to take a woman out on a date. we’ll just talk like people usually do and pretend we are on a date. practice flirting would be awesome, but we don’t have to and i totally understand why you might not want to. you don’t need to be an expert in psychoanalysis, i’m just hoping to hang out with someone and have them point out any bad gut feelings they get around me, or anything weird i say or do during our date.

in terms of the date, i will pay for everything. we’ll pick some place decently nice to make it worth your time. i’m thinking a non alcoholic drink of your choice and dinner. totally free in exchange for some notes about how i was to hang around. i’ve asked friends to do this for me, but the fact is, because they are my friends, they obviously have an opinion of me that is biased in my favor, otherwise they wouldn’t be friends. this is going to help me work on improving myself and my quality of life a lot more than any of you guys can realize, and i will appreciate it a ton.

to reiterate, all i am asking for you is to hang out with me and tell me how i was to be around, good and bad, in as much detail as you can, with no other expectations or strings attatched. you will get a free dinner at a place of your choosing, as well as a free non alcoholic drink like a coffee or boba. thank you in advance to anyone open to taking me up on this.",student life

there's been a larger than anticipated interest in the program and while i am planning to major in this subject, i'm not yet admitted into the major because i haven't fulfilled all of the requirements to apply. for this reason, they had to place me on the programs waitlist to prioritize majors. 

i plan on applying to the major prior to spring quarter, but it appears that this isn't any help because the application period is over so my application will still be considered as a non-major application.

"hfs staffing explained hello all! i've seen a lot of posts asking about the staffing problems with on-campus dining lately and i did a bit of inside research on the subject. here is what i gathered:

as many forum posts have claimed before, the union requires that hfs fill a certain number of full-time positions before giving hours to students. this is where the staffing issue comes from. there are more than enough students, but the pay that hfs offers for ft is too low to keep these positions staffed, and the school is not allowed to supplement them with pt.

tl;dr: yes, this is true.

background: currently, i work at a restaurant making almost double the base salary for retail lead at an hfs position (so in theory i have plenty of bargaining power). more specifics about their retail lead position: it is a required 40 hrs/week with no schedule flexibility, pretty basic (bare minimum imo) benefits, you don't get to choose which location (even from the ones hiring, although they do take preferences into account). at least compared to my current job, none of this is very appealing. i applied for this retail lead position to check it out and received my offer a few months ago.

starting salary is $3,260 - $3,665 ($21.14/hr) for the rl job. the starting pay for new hires (not leads, just team members) including tips at my current job is $23.75, plus schedule and location flexibility and similar benefits. i was offered the upper end of the pay scale. when i explained to hfs that this rate isn't competitive, they told me the wfse union establishes these rates and that is the highest they are allowed to offer. i then called the wfse union to confirm and the rep told me yes, unless the school is having, and i quote, ""trouble hiring people,"" they are required to only offer pay within this range. no lower, but also no higher.

so, i have no idea how the school wedged themselves into an agreement where they can't offer anything higher than a certain rate. unions are supposed to benefit employees and so it seems like somebody in this situation is being predatory to have a pay cap like this (just my theory!). however, from the representative's ""trouble hiring people"" comment, it seems to me that either hfs has not gotten the message or has not communicated the message that their students do indeed feel like they are having trouble hiring people to stay staffed.

the only thing i can think of is if everyone keep complaining! on days when half of the restaurants are closed, or when you go to the hub an hour too late to get food, make a stink about it. raise your voice (not literally at the employees duh), send hfs an email or something, i don't know.",student life

"returning student hey everyone

i had to leave the university at the end of fall quarter 2021 due to mental health and medical issues, and now i’m attempting to return.

my questions for the community…
1. does anyone know what the timeframe is for a response to the returning student request?
2. i didn’t see anything regarding this, but is there a way to provide the university with context as to why i left?
3. how much did i screw myself by not following exit procedure?

"phys 121: purchasing e text &amp; access code to mylab &amp; mastering (💀 why are there so many options…? i’m confused 💀)

so according to the [physics 12x website](https://phys.washington.edu/121-122-123-courses), there are five options to purchase the etext and/or the access code. the access duration for online learning system varies from 18 weeks to 18 months.

this information completely differs from the payment screen on pearson. 

there are three options on the payment screen:
- option a: with e-text access with access to mastering (18 weeks) - $74.99
- option b: with e-text access with access to mastering (up to 24 months (???) ) - $124.99
- option c: without e-text access (up to 24 months (???) ) but with access to mastering - $79.99

the “up to 24 months” confuses the hell out of me because the physics 12x series website says that the access duration is 18 months… (but i digress)

i plan on taking physics 121 in the spring quarter (which is now) and physics 122 in winter quarter 2024 (which is… later (lol) ).

essentially, would i be okay in buying option c when i have a pdf copy of the textbook? i’m confused because the options only say “access to mastering” so would this include mylab and mastering??? is access to mastering referring to the hw??? will i be okay without the etext? 

i just need the cheapest version for the longest amount of time possible that covers what i need to submit for the course—mylab and mastering, and the physics 12x website info (as linked above) is confusing the hell out of me.",academics

"why you might be lonely at uw hi all,

there seems to be a substantial population of lonely people here, and i wanted to give a few reasons as to why that might be.

1. quarter system. people are busy, and it's a nonstop barrage of exams and assignments. on top of caring about grades, everyone around you is trying to pile on extracurriculars. there is a relatively high turnover of new people that you will meet between classes.
2. it's a big school. you have to put in more effort to meet up with somebody, and it's easier to avoid someone or get lost in the crowd.
3. cliques. uw has a few surrounding feeder schools and california students, so people stick to what they know.
4. you're in a major with a higher workload. related to point 1, but if you're doing labs all day it can be harder to find someone you like.

i left out the freeze because it depends on who you talk to, but people around here are friendly. this isn't to say that there are some things that you as an individual can't improve, but i would consider the above to be decent obstacles to making friends. there are folks that do like you for you.

hangar 51 is husky flying club's own flight simulation room located on the top floor of clark hall. the room is equipped with **3 vr-capable flight simulators**. the simulators have both **dcs (digital combat simulator)** and **microsoft flight simulator 2020** installed and ready to play. there is also an faa-approved redbird flight simulator that you can use to earn 5 flight hours with one of our cfis! our club has dedicated instructors who are excited to coach newcomers on how to fly, whether they have zero experience or plenty of real-life flight time. additionally, multiplayer coast-to-coast events are held which feature combat pvp **campaigns/scenarios**! husky flying club members **are able to access the room whenever they schedule it out** as long as they attend enough meetings. newcomers must have an instructor or existing member with them to access the room outside of meetings. if you have your own sim setup, you are free to join our dedicated server during meeting times!

🎮 drone team:

fpv drone racing is a competitive sport where drone pilots wear ar-goggles to race drones from a first-person perspective. these racing drones can go upwards of 60 miles per hour! racing courses consist of a series of obstacles that the drone must navigate through, with the pilot having the fastest lap time winning. we encourage our pilots to use the drone simulators in clark hall whenever they want. outside of racing, our drone team will provide many opportunities for **developing your skills in engineering (nice for your resume**). assembly of drones requires detailed soldering, testing, and shop skills.

&#x200b;

🛠️ aircraft build: in case you also did not know, our club is building the **very first light sport aircraft** on campus (rv-12is)! this is an extremely unique and lucrative project to be involved in and looks great on a resume to practically any engineering-involved company, especially boeing! while this opportunity is full for the quarter, this summer we will still be working on it and planning our projects for this year. all huskies are welcomed into our space at the mech e building during this time!

&#x200b;

🏫 free ground school: mondays on our discord server feature virtual lessons taught by a certified cfi. these lessons, sponsored by emerald squadron aviation llc, are free in our club so long as you are a husky student and have a discord account. if you consistently do well enough in the course, our cfi will sponsor you to take the written knowledge test. this is huge towards gaining your private or recreational pilot's license, considering such lessons are typically hundreds of dollars at local flight schools.

outside of our drone racing team and flight simulators, husky flying club places a big emphasis on **building connections between our members and people in the aviation industry.**  our club holds “aviation talks”, social qna sessions where we bring  people from the aviation industry such as pilots or engineers to talk to  our members. in addition, we are working toward getting our members who  have zero flight experience some time in the air with actual pilots from the local civil air patrol.

"dropping below 12 credits at the end of the quarter while on financial aid ?? hi friends, i have a question. 

at the end of last quarter, i met with my  academic advisor who told me that if i took only 10 credits this spring quarter, my financial aid would be fine because i’d still be completing 36 credits over the whole academic year. well, turns out she has no fuckin idea what she’s talking about, because at the beginning of this quarter, my financial aid did not disburse because i wasn’t registered for at least 12 credits. i told the financial aid office what my advisor said, and they were like yeah no that’s not how it works. so i added a random 3-credit envh class that i haven’t gone to once. 

at the same meeting (which was during week 9 of winter quarter), my advisor told me to drop a 3-credit class i was definitely going to get an ns in (long story but i promise i’m not just lazy). again, she said it would be be fine because i’d still be completing 36 credits over the whole year. so i dropped it in week 9 and thus fell to 10 credits. again, turns out she’s dead wrong, but i never heard anything about it from the financial aid office.    

so my current dilemma - i really really need to drop this envh class. but i’m worried that i just got lucky last quarter or that they haven’t noticed yet, and that if i drop below 12 credits again i’ll have to repay my financial aid or something. 

does anyone know anything about any of this? if you drop below 12 credits at the end of the quarter, do they not care? any advice would be a huge help. thank you :)",advice

the problem is, without financial aid i will not be able to attend without financial aid. since almost every freshman going to uw already confirmed their admission, do you think i have any chance of getting “good” financial aid? is it even worth it to contact the office?

my other problem is that for some reason i got marked as an out of state applicant even though i live in washington, which means higher tuition, which means i also need more financial aid. 

i was already planning on going to community college, so if i end up having to do that because of the cost/being marked as out of state i wouldn’t be so mad but would i even be able to get in again if i decide to go to community college instead of uw? would i get “blacklisted” if i reject my admission? also, does anyone know if i can transfer after just one year or do i have to do two years of cc before transferring?

* is there an official or unofficial forum somewhere to hire students?

* short of a background check, are there reasonable ways to vet a student?

* is it reasonable to ask for a character reference from a staff or faculty member, with the student’s consent?

edit: since it seems like this might generate some leads, here are a few more details.

* 2 dogs 20lb dogs, one is not the best behaved and needs someone with a “dog voice” and experience with dogs

* we’re looking for xmas and spring break for the next 2 years and maybe some other times depending on availability

* if the sitter doesn’t have a vehicle, i can provide one while they house sit, given that they have a valid u.s. drivers license and it clears with my car insurance company",advice

as for me, i really hope that i can receive some advice about my coping strategies during my visa interview. as mentioned in my previous post, i encountered school bullying in my country over 10 years ago. i got seriously affected by that so there basically was no means for me to carry on my study in my middle school then. 

luckily, through my resilience and determination along the path, over time i gradually recovered from that situation and made it to colleges, in a country that is considered foreign to me. so basically i succeeded in making it through, although i basically have to teach myself everything to prepare myself for college, after i was out of that middle school in my country. 

but as my education took a huge hit from the incident, it was significantly delayed and i had to face going to school at a relatively older age, like i had to do it when i am 26. this is gonna be a huge con when applying for a student visa, they suspect you will misuse your visa for immigration or sth illegal. 

i know that i need to explain everything in the interview(i have been rejected once). i really hope that maybe you guys can provide me with some feedback about my interview strategy, it is gonna be so helpful and i wanna see if my words are concise and persuasive enough. i posted my strategy in the comment.

"uw materials science vs cu boulder aerospace  hello,

i'm reaching out on here in hopes that someone would be able to guide me and help me make a decision. i was admitted into uw's materials science program (my home state) but rejected from their aerospace program and received my admission into boulder's aerospace program a bit ago.

for some background, i have always wanted to go into the aerospace field since i was young. i've received internship offers with boeing, interned at an og aerospace company, and had been involved in my school's rocketry team. i want to pursue a career in electric propulsion systems and eventually want to get a graduate degree.

i have financial aid for uw since i was a previous student and had some scholarships racked up. i'm taking a materials science class as a prerequisite right now and am not a huge fan. if i decide to commit to cu boulder, that would mean leaving my family here and having to move in less than a month.

i guess i'm just stuck with my 2 options:

1. uw materials science

pros: in-state, decent financial aid, close to family and friends, minor in aerospace

cons: not the major i ideally want, worried about lack of access to opportunities post-grad

2) cu boulder aerospace

pros: major that interests me, no worry about the types of post-grad opportunities

in my 1st year i took only 1 intro class per quarter (bio 18o + chem 142 and 152) and i developed a pretty good study strategy that helped me get a 4.0 on all my classes. for example doing a dummy load of practice problems to really get the concepts done. i looked at some practice exams for bio and phys and i feel like it might be manageable if i do the same routine of doing more practice exams than memorization.

the thing is that i only like studying in short bursts, which is why i find doing multiple timed practice exams more engaging than stuff like reading textbooks and looking over my notes. which means i don't think i'll do well if both bio 200 + phys 114 are too time-consuming to study for.

what is the availability and cleanliness of kitchen appliances (stoves, refrigerators, pots & pans)?

my shop is focused on skills building. riders can join a class or a clinic, both are group based. individuals can also come in and work with me on specific repairs. everything is learning oriented, all work is pay what you want, pay what you can. group classes mostly meet on sundays. i’m also working on getting an apprenticeship set up for people who want to get trained up to work professionally.

which students are most interested in this type of course? if you’re interested, i’m curious how i would get your attention outside of reddit: post in dorms? email lists for activity groups, like inter murals? at the gym? greek life? where do you go to find out about events happening in seattle?

i am confused why my scholarship was cut down if i'm getting money given back anyways. i asked the finaid office (uw tacoma) but was told that it was because of my need already being met by the grants. if that's why, then why are they still giving me $900 back?

* sometimes they give out free stuff in front of the hub from clubs or whatever. there's also occasionally food trucks there like bbq and what not. if you have time, def take a stroll. i was given laundry detergent by the sustainability club once it was cool but i forgot the name of it
* everybody needs to go to the bathroom for a #2 at some point. explore campus and see which bathroom gives you the maximum comfort for blowing up the toilet without the embarrassment
* the starbucks line at suzello is always so long and there's no order ahead. might as well as do order ahead for the starbucks on the ave and go pick it up
* join clubs if you can! you can always quit, its not a cult. you might find it fun. one of my regret is not being in a club
* if you wanna do research, start emailing profs early. don't overthink, just type up a short intro, attach resume, state motivation, and hit send. 
* if ur on a budget, sizzles and crunch has protein packed salad/rice bowls and its usually large enough you can split it between lunch and dinner
* if you go to the business building(s), them rich mfs are always holding some kind of event and it comes with free food/lunch. so watch for that. also good place to study and nap. 
* there are therapy dogs but the lines are long asf. not worth it.
* burke museum is free, go visit with friends

"questions about safety, transportation, social life, and academics at udub hi!:) i’m a singaporean student who is considering studying (undergrad) psychology in udub. i have some questions below!

safety in the city:
coming from a place as safe as singapore (and also because i’m a small asian female), i'm wondering about the safety aspects in seattle. what's the general consensus on when it's safe to walk outside, especially as a female, whether alone or in a group? any safety precautions or tips i should be aware of? i'm looking to work on my situational awareness to adapt to this change should i end up coming to seattle. 


safety in the canpus: 
i saw the post about uw being ranked the 26th most dangerous campus in the us. do y’all say that ranking is valid? were  there really murder, assault or rape cases recently? 😅i googled ‘washington uni murder’ and got nothing in the campus directly. 

transportation in seattle:
do i need a car in seattle? are the cities/towns surrounding seattle accessible without a car? how safe/reliable is public transport? how safe is it to take when i’m on my own, and what time is the latest i should be on it? and for those times when i'd like to explore the surroundings, how much would a rideshare like 'grab' typically cost? 

exploring washington's nature:
i've heard that washington has loads of beautiful nature.  how do those of you without cars manage to enjoy the natural beauty? any tips for public transportation or organized group trips for hiking and such?

udub as a commuter school?:
is udub considered a commuter school? i'll be arriving in seattle alone, and i'm eager to make friends not only with other international students but also with americans. are locals generally open to new friendships? are there any tips for breaking into social circles? are high school cliques challenging to break into?
also, i’m not a huge drinker. in fact i’m not a fan of alcohol although i don’t mind drinking occasionally. would this negatively affect my social life a lot? i’m wondering whether it’ll be difficult to find a bunch of nerdy friends in udub.

lastly, is it common to eat out with friends? i’ll be coming to udub on a budget and probably can’t afford to eat out every day so i wanna know if i’ll suffer a lot socially if i pack my own food or something.


participation in school clubs:
i'm planning to join some school clubs, like some boardgames/d&d clubs, outdoor clubs, and more. do members typically hang out for meals or drinks after club sessions, or do most people head straight home?


psychology program at uw:
lastly, i'm interested in the psychology program at uw. could anyone share their experiences or insights about it? are there direct postgraduate pathways, or do most require work experience?

also, does the school have industry connections and good internship placements? i am hoping to do some marketing related internships in the us just in case i don’t make it into postgrad for psych.

"how competitive and math-y is an economics major? hi, i am a intended philosophy major who is looking to double major in economics, i have heard they are a good combination and i have a bunch of extra credits from doing ib/ap in high school so i either double major or graduate early lol

anyway, i'm not a huge mathy guy, i did pretty well in high school calculus but was always more of a humanities guy which is why i have philosophy as my major which is my passion. however, i took an ib econ class in high school and enjoyed it, though it was pretty basic concepts. how much math is involved in the more advanced econ classes at udub?

also, from some older posts (6-7 years ago) on this sub, a common discussion is about how rampant cheating is in upper-level econ classes. apparently, there are hella international students who will do anything to get the perfect score in these classes, and since they are apparently curved pretty hard,  honest students' gpas get tanked. as a student who is planning on going on to grad/law school, would these upper-level econ classes tank my gpa and lower my chances?

so is the state of econ at udub still very competitive, gpa-killing, and rampant with cheating, or is it better now? should someone who's not really into math still take the major (ba, of course, you couldn't force me to take all the math classes required for an econ bs)?

also as a side note, i was looking into sociology as a possible double major with philosophy instead of econ, since it seems to overlap with econ concepts a lot but just a lot less math.

also also, i have had a meeting with my advisor about all this stuff but bro just told me to ""take an econ class and see if you like it"" which was ultimately pretty useless ngl",academics

"best and worst education courses since there is a lot to choose from, i was wondering if anyone would be willing to share their favorite courses from the college of education, as well as courses to avoid. personally, i would recommend:

educ 211 with charles ives. - the class content is really interesting and i would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys discussion-based classes. charles is very chill and is overall a nice guy. the class involves a fair bit of reading and writing, but the grading is pretty generous.

edpsy 404 with jodi burrus newman - similarly, jodi is also very chill and nice. the class involves a nice mix between lecture and discussion and we talk a lot about our own experiences of being an adolescent. the workload is fairly light for a 5-credit course and the grading scale is generous.

i don’t know, i do pretty well on the programming assignments but i feel like this is gonna ruin my gpa. i did my third quiz today, and while i felt pretty confident, seeing my last quiz really makes me feel distrustful of that confidence.

every single professor responded except for my physics professor. i double checked his syllabus and it says to email him about absences, not a ta. it's been weeks and i've sent a follow up email. his is the only class i'm in with graded participation and i'm worried that the ~17 (to be honest it may be even more) days of missed class will affect my grade. 

not sure what to do..... if anyone has advice please let me know because i'm really stressed about this and have just been trying my best. 

prof is usama al binni and the class is phys115 :/",academics

uw absn nursing waitlist hey guys. i just got the notification from uw that i was waitlisted for the uw absn nursing program for autumn 2024. here's my dilemma. i got into a different university that is decent but nothing like the quality of uw which is the school i originally wanted. the other school i got accepted into though starts this january which is already a tight schedule for me since it's out of state whereas uw is in state for me. me and my parents talked and we're not sure what to do. should i ask the school i got accepted into whether they can transfer my acceptance into a later start date? is it worth it to wait for a change in the waitlist? how many people do you think get accepted off the waitlist if i start in autumn which will be awhile from now? any knowledge or help will be greatly appreciated!,advice

"geography data science: everything you need to know hello dawgs,

if you're reading this, you either didn't get into a major or you're a freak that likes maps. either way, it's going to be okay. 

i'm writing this because there is a severe lack of student resources about the geography data science major, and it is an open major which creates a lot of questions.  so from the coursework to the department to the career prospects, i am going to give you everything i know about being in gds.

**how do you know if gds is for you?** 

you need to have a passion for data visualization, coding, and maps. it is a great technical degree in a growing industry.

first of all, the geography department is a relatively small department of students and faculty that is hidden on the fourth floor of smith hall. from what i've seen, geography coursework is separated into two categories. half of the classes are more humanities-based geography classes focused on the historical, political, and socio-economic aspects of geography. highly interesting, but nothing technical. the other half are data science classes focused on developing maps with custom software and scripting languages.

geography data science is a bachelors of science degree. an audit will require that you take a shit ton of 300 level geography classes, intro cse classes, and a machine learning course(s). 

**the classes i have taken in order of importance:**  
geog 360: intro mapping class focused on an open-source mapping software, qgis. somewhat tedious, maybe a little boring, but highly important.

geog 458: taught by the same prof as 328, another class that teaches more advanced techniques for geospatial web programming. the projects you build in this class can be pretty professional. html/css/mapbox/arcgis api js/node.js/postgresql. also a choose your own adventure and teaches you a lot about mapping ethics.

geog 328: teaches you how to create web based visualizations using javascript/html/css and mapbox. great technical add and covers a lot of material. projects are great for a portfolio.

geog 465: introductory sql class teaching you how to map using a postgresql backend. highly important for full-stack coding, a little tedious at times.

geog 450: a python course focused on creating seattle based visualizations that have nothing to do with maps. teaches python scripting, web crawling, d3.js and more. not the most necessary class but certainly helpful.

favorite profs: 

gunwha oh: the dawg, super sweet korean lady that cares about her job, her students, and maps!

bo zhao: the beast, this guy makes maps like a mofo. best laid-out classes in the major. all on github.

&#x200b;

**career prospects:**

* level one: arcgis monkey, using esri products to build out data viz. this is the most simplistic, most common way to perform gis and the lowest paying.
* level two: gis web dev, create geospatial applications using full stack.
* level three: geospatial data scientist, be a god of the domain. basically, just a data scientist with a geospatial stack, creating data pipelines, viz, applications, and ml models. 

there are infinite ways to make money in geospatial. just think, the more skilled you are the more you are likely to get paid.

where can i work?:  
any tier-one company, of course. anything that has to do with maps. i noticed a lot of government jobs require highly specific geospatial web app skills. even pokemon go hires geography data scientists. look up esri as well, this is one of the largest mapping companies.

classes i have heard about:

urban gis, geog 317 and a few others are all esri based classes using arcgis. supposedly teach you some cool stuff with an industry staple software.

"given my unique situation, should i be putting my graduation date as march or june of 2024? hi all,

i’m a senior who will be graduating this year. i’m in a unique situation where this is my last “real” quarter of classes, as in my last quarter where i will be attending classes in-person. i have finished all of the requirements for my degree and major, and i could have technically applied to graduate after winter quarter. however, i will be taking a full-time credit course load in the spring for two reasons: to finish one of my two minors (only one class remaining) and to be able to receive an additional quarter of the generous financial aid that has essentially paid me to attend school. so, i will only be taking one class for one of my two optional minors i have added on, and the rest will just be fun and easy electives to hit the full time requirement for financial aid. 

all of these classes that i am taking are completely online, and my classes for winter quarter will be concluding at the beginning of march. as a result, i have been looking for full-time jobs starting immediately since i have the availability to begin my career early, and to get a head start versus having to compete with many more people who also will be graduating in june.

here’s my question: on my resume, i have been listing that i am graduating in march of 2024, since i will have technically met every single requirement for my degree, both general electives and my specific concentration, outside of the one optional minor. furthermore, i am afraid if i list june that employers will think i am not available until then and would reject my application thinking i don’t have the availability to start right away. this is something that if granted initial interviews, i plan on clarifying right away that while i could technically have my degree, on paper i technically do not, given the reasons above, but that i will in 3 months. i don’t want to “deceive” anyone, but given my unique situation i think i am better off putting march and then explaining my situation if i am provided an interview

i guess what i’m trying to ask is, is this okay to do? am i technically lying? i don’t want employers to possibly think i am trying to be deceitful or something of the sorts. i saw a tiktok about someone who lied and said they had a degree and they didn’t when they were technically 6 credits short. they had gone through 3 interviews without disclosing it, and had their offer rescinded as a result. i’m not sure if that person was still actively in school or not, but now it has left me paranoid. should i be putting june instead, even though i am able to start right now? any and all advice is greatly appreciated. thank you in advance!",advice

"list of tools and apps that make your student life easier. as a graduate, i realized there are many smart ways i should have utilized during my time in school to enhance productivity. i've come to understand that numerous tools exist that significantly simplify student life. allow me to share a few tools here that can aid you (especially freshmen and sophomores) in navigating your student life.

notion and timetable: these are essential tools for organizing your life. if you spend enough time scrolling through tiktok (i know you do), and you're unaware of these tools, you've been living under a rock. utilize these tools and search for tutorials on youtube about how to effectively use them as a student.

remnote: another must-have tool. this application employs common study methods to enhance your studying experience. it assists in creating flashcards and applying evidence-based memory techniques. don't just take my word for it—look it up on youtube; you won't regret it.

insight trunk newsletter: ever feel left out when conversing with friends who seem to know everything? look up this newsletter on google and make it a habit to read. they provide 10-minute reads on various topics that you can peruse on the bus, during breakfast, or before sleeping. two years from now, you'll become the smartest person in your friend group.

myfitnesspal: now, let's move on to health. first up is myfitnesspal, which helps you track your caloric intake. simply use this app to scan whatever you purchase, and you'll know how many calories you're consuming. it's an excellent choice for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

fitbod: this one is optional. if money isn't an issue and you can afford a personal trainer, that's fantastic! if not, fitbod is a more affordable alternative. it tailors a fitness program based on your weight, height, age, and other factors.

classpass: another important aspect of student life is socializing. while classes should be your priority, this app helps you join multiple local fitness classes. instead of sticking to one place, you now have the opportunity to explore various classes, increasing your chances of meeting new people who share your hobbies.

isavemoney: this is a budgeting app, but honestly, any budgeting app will work. this one is my personal choice.",student life

"oos affordability (or lack there of) and general advice hi, i just got admitted as an oos applicant into pre social science. i have like a billion questions, so advice on any of them would be greatly appreciated.

in terms of oos affordability, wtf is the deal? i got $4200 from the purple and gold scholarship, so that covers a tiny bit (tysm so so generous 😭) but what am i looking at for total cost? i would look into this on my own but i’m honestly so confused on varying sticker prices. i have around 60k (probably a little less) in college savings, but i know that’s not going to cover all four years, maybe not even one. does the university give any more money based on the fafsa? or am i totally screwed? my fafsa is already messed up because the 2022 information is before my father quit his job and went off the deep-end leaving me in a single income divorced family situation so idk the expected contribution. i think my mom makes around 100k a year but she really only got our house and the cars in the divorce so there’s not a ton of equity there. 

with the financial context set, assuming uw is even an option, how does applying to majors work? this quirky system scares me because i am wholly unsure of my future career and major. i like political science but would probably go to law school after because there’s not a lot of jobs there (especially that pay well). i also like biology and anthropology but don’t want to be in academia. i’m hoping that i’ll find a career that pairs my interests in a way that also pays off my debt lmfao. with my uncertainty in mind, wtf do i do my freshman year. it seems like you have to be proactive about taking prereqs for the majors and that they’re competitive and i feel like it’ll be hard to compete when i literally don’t know where i’ll be competing.

this is a more general question about college trade-offs, but is it really worth it to go somewhere that feels boring and unfulfilling if it’s the cheapest option? i got into umn with honors (i’d have little to no debt there), but it’s only 5 hours from home and i need to get out of the midwest lol. i also found out my ex is going there and i honestly feel like my growth would be stunted if i’m surrounded in the same environment that i’m trying to escape right now. that sounds a little dramatic but the past two years of my life have been hell and this girl embodies all of that suffering lol. also, this is 100% an ego thing, but i’ve worked so hard and academics have been the foundation of my self worth my whole life and i’m going to be dissapointed if i end up at a college half of my hs class goes to.

i always knew the community college transfer route is a great path, but further research made it seem like it's in fact an amazing path. [data from uw](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/transfer/ctc-admissions-data) seems to show that almost 70% of transfer applicants are accepted into uw. among that 70%, it seems that 89% who apply into electrical & computer engineering (ece) are accepted?

if this is true, i feel that this should be a great path to take. after making sure that my community college has the pre-req courses necessary for the ece major, **do you guys think community college is the way to go? any advice or people who have gone down a similar path?**

the main thing keeping me from attending another 4-year is cost savings. not just living from home, but my lenient chill job pays me $24/hour, so staying home while keeping that job could have great financial outcomes. plus, it seems that as long as i maintain good performance in terms of gpa and activities, i may have an excellent chance at ece.",advice

"a&a 4 year plan (junior) i'm in a weird spot where i became a student at uw with slightly less than one full year completed on the 4 year plan for a&a. i had basically everything done except for physics and engr101. i also had some other classes like math 224 and all my a&h classes completed. i've been cramming the classes i need to be finished with my first two years (currently taking cee220, me230, and phys123). after this, all i need is amath301 and aa260. my original plan was to do aa260 this summer and amath301 in the autumn. but i've recently been thinking about just taking both classes in the summer. the only downside is i won't be living here this summer and i'll have to commute to uw. i also just applied for my major through the capacity constrained route, so lots of this stuff is just up in the air for now. i was wondering if anyone else had recommendations for what classes i should take in the summer if i do get into my major. starting in the autumn, i'll be set to take aa310, aa311, aa320 and the undergraduate seminar class. do you think it would be too hard to take amath301 with all these classes? and do all these a&a classes have exams or are they more project focused? i was also thinking about taking me123 at some point and figured i might be able to take it in the autumn of i don't end up doing amath301.",advice

"math credit waived for taking higher level class? i’m in a really dumb situation that i put myself in and i so desperately need guidance or advice. i had math 125/126 credit from running start, and throughout college i took math 207/207/224 for my degree. note …. i did not have math 124 credit because of some technicalities. i (stupidly) assumed that eventually i could get it waived somehow, so i put off even dealing with the credit until now as a senior.

last quarter i went to my advisors and asked for waiver, and while they seemed somewhat hopeful that it would get waived they eventually got back to me and informed me that it isn’t able to be waived. and not only that, i’m not eligible to take the course for credit at uw because the math department has a rule about taking a lower-level class for credit … so my only option would have been to take it at a community college or to take a higher level course (either math 209, or upper level amath course, etc) for substitution. i tried looking into a local community college but that would have been ~$1000 i would have had to pay out of pocket for, which i can’t afford, so i tried sucking it up and taking one of the amath courses this quarter.

it’s just not going well for me. the course is so difficult and beyond my understanding or interest. i go to class, and i review the notes but a single problem takes me 1-2 hours just to create a gameplan and understand what to do. my professor’s office hours was full with almost a third of the class there too, and others have made comments about our first homework’s difficulty. i’m also just going through so much in life right now, like i just broke up with my long-term partner of 4 years and now i have to go through the process of moving back home. other stuff also going on in my life but honestly the breakup is the one hitting pretty hard. 

i thought i could just deal with this but to be honest i can’t. this is really difficult for me. maybe i’m being entitled but i was shocked that the solution was to take a significantly higher-level course for credit that i otherwise wouldn’t have been expected to take. 

has anyone ever been in a situation like this before? does anyone have advice? i was thinking of going to the math department’s advising hours tomorrow and asking them directly for help since i haven’t done that yet. i knownit’s such a dumb situation i did to myself, and i need to deal with the consequences, but i’m feeling so hopeless because i don’t think i can do this.",advice

"is it worth trying to transfer in to cs, or just transferring to uw tacoma cs? i need to pay for myself financially, but i also want to give myself more opportunities so i was wondering whether i should just continue as a transfer to uws, or just aim to transfer to tacoma instead. 

the gpa recommendation for seattle is a 3.75 minimum with extra-curriculars which is easy enough to be competitive, but i don’t want to be rejected and then have almost nothing transfer over to tacoma so not sure if i should just play it safe with uwt or not.

"can i take summer classes at a cc before freshman year? hey guys, 

i'm a senior in hs doing running start and i'll be going to uw this fall. i've been knocking out the prerequisites for both cs and informatics during my time at a cc, but my calc 2 and phys 1 grades weren't great and i'd like to redo them. 

i was wondering if doing them again over the summer at a cc before the fall quarter at uw is possible? it would be a great way to boost my gpa when trying to get admitted to cs. 

if the summer quarter option isn't possible,  how would taking calc 2 and phys 1 in my first quarter of cs look in the admission process? i would take info 200 along with it to finish off the informatics prerequisites. 

if anyone has tried going either route can you let me know how it went? would they look desperate/ knock me some points in the cs admission process?
