let's  say someone has some (limited) influence over the way some of your  teachers teach on zoom, canvas, twitch, or whatever system they use.  what would you tell them?

what do you want from remote teaching? what do you want teachers to know? what best practices do you see?

"state of the sub/mod update hello huskies,

first of all i would like to apologize for all the confusion that's been had these past few days/months/years. we (the mods) have not been super active or communicative in this sub, and we've let things get out of control. i'm sorry about that. going forward this will not be the case.

fortunately, we've finally been able to get in touch with bamitup, and he has granted me additional content management permissions. i can now see all of the automod settings and the full moderation queue.

just to clear up any confusion:

1. posts or comments by accounts with negative comment karma are automatically removed.
2. posts or comments by accounts that are less than 3 days old are automatically removed.
3. posts or comments that are reported many times are automatically removed and are to be manually reviewed by the mods.

to be clear: we are not removing comments that are critical of uw staff. we are not trying to silence your opinions. there is no grand conspiracy of uw staff infiltrating the sub (at least that i am aware of). we were just unclear about what kind of content was being auto removed.

going forward, we're definitely going to need more mods. i currently **do not** have the ability to add mods, so i will contact bam about that. i don't know how many mods we need or who they should be (i've had some people pm me about it), so i think it would be a good idea if we had an open discussion about it here. i personally think the team should be made up of active students, but let's discuss.

finally, i've been getting intermittent pms about people who have been auto banned in the past. if you think you've been unjustly banned by automod, please pm me and i will look into it. i can't unban you directly but i'll have one of the other mods do it.

again i apologize for the issues here. we will right this ship. thanks.",discussion

"revised study advice **foreword:**

because some people have contacted me privately and legitimately thought my advice was helpful i am putting a toned down version here. i will elaborate more in the comment section.


**grading system:**

for curved classes, the median grade will be fixed to a certain gpa. for most weed out courses this will be in the 2.8 to 3.1 range. in a class of 200 about 4-6 people will receive a 4.0, 6-8 a 3.9, and so on up to about 20-25 receiving a gpa in the 3.5 range. this means to get a 3.5+ gpa you will need to be in the top 30% of your class.


**maintaining focus:**

a common complaint is that students are spending lots of time studying but with no payoff. when you study you will need to achieve a point of focus. put away your distractions and stay put at a desk and when you take a break only do it to use the restroom or take a quick bite. refrain from doing activities that have the potential to distract you. i personally recommend staying at a desk for 4 hours at a time. two 2 hours sessions without getting up with a break in between should work as well. at first you will feel bored and will not be able to concentrate. that is normal. push through it, and eventually you will be able to ""zone out"" and study effectively.


**in regards to lectures, textbooks, and videos:**

for the weed out classes i personally think the textbook is all you really need. yes learning form a textbook can be hard and confusing that is all part of the process. as things become more complex, your textbook is going to become your main source of information so i think getting used to it is going to be of great benefit. as for lectures there's really no point in showing up unless you are going to actively follow along and take notes (preferably handwritten). and finally, i think people should use youtube videos cautiously as they can be a time consuming and passive way to learn that works out to be not as effective long term.


**what to study:**

a lot of people think that studying consists of reviewing notes and reading the textbook. while this is a good way to start, it really only gives a lay of the land. you will need to do what is called active learning in order to be able to tackle the wide range of problems professors will throw at you. i recommend forming a study group with regular meeting times so that everyone is held accountable. each person should create problems in the form of a scenario that uses a concept from the class. refrain from asking simple things like ""what is x"", but rather aim for ""something y is being affected by object z, why is that?"". the process of forming questions and discussing the answer with others i found to be highly effective.",academics

"really could use some student input on if i should attend i'm currently a california senior trying to decide between here and university of wisconsin. initially, i was all on board with the idea of udub, but after looking into it, it seems like there's a toxic environment.

i'm admitted as dtc for engineering, so while i won't have to worry about getting into engineering, i still don't have a specific major. this is one of my biggest concerns. i keep hearing things about how competitive and cutthroat the students can be because everyone wants to get into their major. on top of that students apparently need to create an entire application, personal statement and all, just to apply for a major.

as for the social scene. i keep hearing that people are distant. something about a 'seattle freeze' and that it isn't really the easiest to meet a lot of people at school. additionally i hear that parties are few and far between if you're not in the greek system. does the school's reputation  as a commuter school really ring true?

overall i was just really hoping to hear some students' responses to some of these things. i really like the idea of being in seattle, having access to all these great companies in the area, and i love the idea of staying on the west coast. however, i don't want an atmosphere where people only have time to study and are constantly stressed.",discussion

"should i stay at uw (neuro) i'm currently a sophomore (soon to be junior) majoring in biology, and i recently got accepted to ucsd as a transfer majoring in neurobiology. i also plan to minor in applied math (have taken 301 and am planning on taking 3 more classes), and chemistry (if possible). currently i have a 3.5 overall gpa, with a 3.3 average across the bio series, so i think my chances at the neuroscience major are somewhat slim. however, i have had a year's worth of research experience in a neuroscience lab, and i've been involved in some neuroscience related clubs for quite a while (i'm also president of a non-neuro/bio rso). is it worth staying at uw, considering i probably won't get into the neuroscience major? how much does the major (biology vs. neuroscience) matter for graduate school (what i'm leaning towards) and/or medical school (something i'm considering but am not entirely sure of)? i'd like to do something with neuroscience in graduate school, so that might be important.   


currently the factors that are keeping me staying are: i have leadership positions at uw, uw has better/more neuroscience related clubs for undergrads, i have another lab lined up at uw that's very undergrad friendly/good for my transition into independent research, i can have minor(s) at uw, and uw might be better for my gpa because i can take less classes/have a less intense schedule.   


the factors encouraging me to transfer are: tuition (i'm a ca resident), weather, major (neurobiology vs biology), and the fact that ucsd is super good for neuro.  


considering everything, is it worth staying? what would you do, or if you've been in this situation, what did you do?

"""easy 4.0"" classes review - winter and spring 2020 i was thinking this would help you all with future class registrations. this school year i took a few of the suggested easy classes on our megathreads and i'm here to provide an updated review. this includes psych 101, ais 103, ais 270, and drama 215.  


**winter 2020:**  


**• (i&s, 5 cr) psych 101 w/ judith l. mclaughlin:** honestly, i loved every second of this class. mclaughlin is so sweet. she was always open to scheduling meetings outside of office hours if there was a time conflict with my classes. the tas also had office hours. in terms of grading, she graded based off of 3 online assignments (for completion), poll everywhere in-class questions (for completion), and 4 non-cumulative multiple-choice exams. i was also able to raise my grade up to a maximum of 0.3 gpa points by participating in psychology studies outside of class (as the test subject). for the workload, i spent around 2 hours studying and reviewing notes everyday and got a 4.0. i didn't find it necessary to read everything in the textbook; she provided a study guide for us to focus on specific concepts and sections. her exam questions gave a scenario and we needed to match it to a concept we learned in class. given this, we didn't need to do that much rote memorization since she gave similar scenarios in her lectures. unfortunately, i never fully paid attention (my own fault) so i just made quizlet sets to remember the concepts. you can find them here if you want to get a feel for the content: [https://quizlet.com/kpolful](https://quizlet.com/kpolful)  


overall, i wouldn't call it an ""easy 4.0"" since you need to put a good amount of effort in every week to get one. for perspective, she revealed the score spread after every test and only 30-40% of the class consistently got above 90%. however, it's definitely an easy 3.5+.  


**• (i&s & div, 5 cr) ais 103 w/ dian million:** imagine the coolest aunt you could ever ask for. that's dian. lectures consisted of dian telling stories about her inspiring indigenous origin and watching films. our work consisted of four ""quizzes"" that each had around 5 long answer questions (250-500 words each). they're based on 3-20 page readings she posts to canvas. why quizzes is in quotation marks is because we had 2 weeks to answer them. there was also an assignment for us to go to burke to research indigenous artifacts and a final art project to convey our emotions for a topic we learned during the quarter (graded on completion).  


""easy 4.0"" approved. although she's not teaching for fall quarter 2020, i'm sure any introductory ais class will be similar in workload.  


**spring 2020 (keep in mind the online format may have significantly affected the workload):**  


**• (i&s & div, 5 cr) ais 270 w/ charlotte cote:** imagine your other coolest aunt. that's charlotte. our work consists of interacting with two discussion boards and a final quiz. charlotte explicitly said she was planning on assigning two quizzes but kept it to one because of how much stress we're going through. bless her soul. in the discussion boards you have to write an answer to questions related to the lectures and readings (similar to ais 103) in around 500-600 words total. after that, you post a question and respond to three other classmates. we're getting an entire week to work on the final quiz so i assume it's also long answer.  


""easy 4.0"" approved (online)  


**• (vlpa, 5 cr) drama 215 w/ skip mercier:** this was never mentioned, but somebody should add this to the list of easy 4.0s. skip is passionate about set/costume design and always strives to pass on that passion to his students. did you know he worked on plays for alice in wonderland and finding nemo? seriously, cool guy. it seems this class is fairly new and shows up every spring quarter. every week we have a few assignments (1-3) that have us test and improve our skills with a new concept of theater design. some examples include drawing a building with the use of perspective and drawing our own rube goldberg machine. there's also a final group project. it's all graded on completion so...

"an unpopular opinion i would actually prefer fall quarter to be completely online.

yes, i'm fricking sick of staying home, and yes, i'm sick of zoom. i have zero motivation and am depressed most days because of this global pandemic. but that's very minuscule compared to people's health and seeing loved ones with family, die. i don't think i'd feel safe to go back to a university, with 20,000+ people in the usa alone diagnosed with covid-19 daily right now. i'm sure this number would decrease by september, but i doubt this whole thing will be over. with that being said, i would feel very uncomfortable, even with social distancing (we all know there will be some people who don't comply) and mask usage (not everyone will wear masks, obviously). we wouldn't know who has the virus because covid can stay asymptomatic for 2 weeks, we don't know whether the doorknob we touch or the desk we lean against has virus germs on it. students live with grandparents or people who are more vulnerable to covid-19. commuting students also take public transportation systems that are used by a lot of people. people's safety and human lives are so, so much more important than some attendance points.

i know seattle is slowly flattening the curve. even though we were the state that had the first covid-19 patient back in january, i really do believe we are handling it very well and at a quicker pace than other states since our city has tech jobs. this allowed people to start working from home early. seattle's doing great, and statistics are showing that the curve is very slowly flattening (barely below 200 on may 11th! thank you healthcare workers :') ) but even a small, localized outbreak leads to trouble, and we have seen that with other countries who have started to become less restrictive when their cases have dropped. i know a lot of fellow peers right now are feeling hella lonely, sad, anxious, etc., and i know this would suck for the incoming freshman, but the more we take this pandemic seriously and the safer measures we take, the less *deaths* and diagnoses we will have to see. for many people, this is a *deadly* pandemic.

i am just wondering how the pacing of summer quarter usually goes. all of these courses are specifically meant to be online, unlike this quarter, and i feel like i’m able to handle it. i attempted to find “easier” courses to take compared to what i usually take also. i just don’t have any insight into how fast or rigorous next quarter might be as it is shorter, so i’m looking for some advice :) any insight helps! thank you in advance!!",academics

"clarity on the hfs housing addendum hi there, i've been reading through recent housing post responses from /u/uw_hfs as well as the uw hfs addendum on myhfs and i'm getting some contradictory responses.

the official 2020-21 hfs public health agreement addendum states:

>the following is an addendum to your 2020-21 housing agreement. all students who wish to live on campus for the 2020-21 year must agree to this addendum **by 11:59 p.m. (pdt) on july 12, 2020**.  
>  
>applicants who do not complete this form will have their 2020-21 housing application and agreement cancelled by hfs at no charge and will not be permitted to live on campus.

from what i gather, this means that if you do not wish to live on campus in the fall but want to have a chance to apply in winter and spring, you must sign the addendum and then cancel your 9-month housing plan on myhfs. however, a recent response (link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/hpy5fd/housing_options_for_midway_through_the_year/fxur1f6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)) by /u/uw_hfs contradicts the passage above:

>if you’re not planning to live on campus for autumn quarter, you should not sign the addendum and you should cancel your housing, today. everyone who cancels will be contacted in the next few months with instructions on how to apply for winter quarter if they would like to apply for winter quarter.

this doesn't address the scenario where a student doesn't want to live on-campus during the autumn quarter, but wishes to reapply in winter. if a student doesn't sign the addendum because they don't want to live in the autumn quarter (as per the statement above), they won't have a chance to reapply in the winter, spring, or summer either. 

could we get some clarification as to what students should do regarding the addendum if they wish to apply for housing in the winter/spring but not during autumn?

hot (maybe shit) take: honestly i think it is good to exaggerate/risk over-stressing how low the chances of success for pre-sciences intended cs students are. while it is technically possible to get into cse from pre-sciences and non-interest-changer, the reality is that the vast majority of people who try won't succeed because 1) the acceptance rate is misleading because a huge number of people self-select out of the application pool after getting mediocre grades and are literally told not to apply by cse admissions, 2) the application pool is already of people who got into uw, meaning all the ""long shot"" freshman applications are filtered out, and 3) everyone in the application pool chose to go to uw intended cs despite being warned of the risks (except interest-changers), meaning they were all reasonably confident in their abilities to get in and willing to work very hard. additionally, the consequences of getting rejected from your major are much, much worse than getting rejected from a college as a freshman because by the time people get rejected from a major they have already invested 1-2 years of their entire undergrad career. most pre-sciences intended cs ppl don't seem to truly get this. instead, most people way overestimate their abilities, get lured in by the potential reward of gambling on uw, severely underestimate how competitive admissions are, and might not be properly informed to begin with.

in part i blame this on the fact that this sub and other places seem to frame the issue as ""if you don't get direct admit, that just means you need to try hard! here are some application tips for when you apply to cs in your sophomore year. oh, but you should probably consider other schools as well."" i think a much healthier framing is to tell high school seniors to treat a rejection from da as a rejection and move on, kinda like how people treat getting waitlisted. since the current admissions pathway for cs from pre-sciences is intended for interest-changers, imo it's kinda misleading to view this as a ""second chance"" to get into cse if people are rejected from da.

moreover, the huge sea of cs rejects hurts the morale of pretty much the whole school since many majors have a large number of people who don't actually want to be there. that's a drag on everyone in those departments' college experience and it's even worse for the people who are in a major they're unhappy with. it also unfairly stigmatizes majors that people use as ""backup programs"" by creating an impression that people in these majors are only there because they couldn't get into cse. i'm double majoring in cs and one of the majors that are seen this way (with more of my focus/passion/career plans put into this major than cs) and it frankly hurts that people's passion in the subject/major are looked down on in this way. i see this as a big culture problem for the university that reducing the number of prospective cs students at uw would largely solve.

i'm curious to see what people think about a potential solution: ban ppl who apply for da from applying to the major as a current student. this could maybe solve the problems that cs admissions has on other departments and help students' mental health by preventing them from spending years trying and failing to get into cse, while maintaining the pathway for interest changers.

"created a personal finance cash flow projection spreadsheet - uw themed for the upcoming school year! so...i have been utilizing a paid financial tool for a long time that allowed me to input financial events in a calendar that displayed projected account balances on each day of the month forecast however long in the future that i would like based on the expenses/income that i input. yesterday i had the thought that i could do this pretty easily in google sheets instead of paying a monthly fee. naturally as i was working, i thought to utilize uw's brand guidelines which led me to think that maybe, just maybe i could put it out there and help some people with financial woes for this upcoming year!

the spreadsheet is formatted like a yearly calendar. you can start by entering your starting balance for your savings/checking accounts at the top of the month of august tab (or if you're getting to this late, you can start in september). each day you can input as many as seven financial events, all sorted into checking expense/income or savings expense/income. each time you input a financial event, the balance at the bottom of each day will reflect that days events and any previous events. the first tab on the spreadsheet is an example of a months expenses and other features explained within a couple of cell notes (marked with a black triangle in the top right of a cell).

any questions/comments can be posted here and i will try to keep the sheet updated with anything that might be incorrect/needs improvement!

"likelihood of uw closing dorms... i’ve been seeing a lot of comments around this sub lately about how “hfs is definitely gonna send students back home a week after classes start” or “dorms are not gonna last until december” and such, and so i wanted to make this post as a sort of discussion for that topic.


personally speaking, i don’t see a scenario where hfs has to close. there’s no argument that spring was the height of the pandemic for washington, and the surge of cases that came with july 4th has mellowed out and we’re back at a ~2% positivity rate with tests in king county. so, as it stands, we are doing better than spring and yet dorms remained open during that time.


also, i believe it was u/uw_hfs (could’ve been someone else) who commented here before detailing how hfs has learned a lot from the spring experience and will be taking care of things even better (regarding disinfection and whatnot), so assuming cases only get as bad as they were at the height of the pandemic so far, hfs will be better-equipped.


most of the colleges that have closed dorms are at high-risk areas. some haven’t even closed at all and are handling it in a different way, like in tennessee. a college over there decided to evacuate a single residence hall and just use it for students who need to self-isolate. well, hfs already has that with hansee i believe, which shows their level of preparation, and has unused buildings like mcmahon and haggett that could be used for that if it ever came down to that.


i might be underestimating the potential surge in cases that can come with students returning to campus, but i’m sure you guys already know that greek houses were active all summer and many more greek students returned a couple weeks ago and this week. and still, cases trend down significantly. of course, things change when you throw oos students into the mix and those from eastern wa, but i think a poll on here (not super representative, i know) showed that many oos students are not flying out here and on-campus residents are primarily in-state (makes sense).


i guess i’m biased because i plan on staying on-campus, but this whole “hfs gonna close down right away, we’re fucked” thing is a huge assumption that is based off the experiences of schools in hotspots (aka, conservative states). hfs has re-iterated over and over that they are well-equipped to handle whatever is coming, and worst-case they’ll put residence halls into quarantine mode like some other colleges have done. but i don’t even think that’ll happen.


in order for hfs to consider closing, i think the daily cases have to get significantly worse than the july 4th height. that was 900-1000 daily cases for washington, and like ~300 for king county (someone correct me if i’m wrong). now, it’s up to you to decide: are we gonna go from 200-300 cases a day (now) to 900-1000 cases a day in october just from uw dorms reopening? and can it get worse than that? 


anything can happen, so i hope it doesn’t come to hfs closing down, but it doesn’t hurt to be a bit more optimistic. dorms were never the best places to party anyway (mcmahon was the only place where it can be pulled off and that building is closed lmao)


the way the ima is operating right now shows how seriously uw takes the coronavirus i think. my friends claim the ima is “shitty” right now because you can’t even spot someone benching and there’s like only 3 spots to workout in the dumbbell area due to heavy (and necessary) social distancing. sucks, but it says a lot about how much caution is being taken at the uw. have faith!

"unpopular opinion about covid-19 (i think) i will start this post by saying i am an incoming freshman, living on campus this year. 

i see everyone posting about how they completely expect that students living on campus should strictly follow all social distance requirements, and should avoid meeting and spending time with new people. from what i understand, people fear that with enough cases at the uw, everyone will be sent home, and no one wants that. but this reaction to send the student populations with high covid counts home is entirely irresponsible. for the overwhelming majority, most students are not affected anymore than they are with the seasonal flu unless they have pre-existing health problems. sending students home will only spread covid to hundreds of communities across the country. 

i wish i could have a normal freshman year, where i could learn effectively by being in a classroom environment. i wish that i could feel a sense of community at the university that my family pays so much for. i wish that i would be able to meet friends, and socialize. i fear that for the first quarter (at the least), life on campus will be miserable. 

it just seems so egregious and pointless to keep students apart from each other, so long as they live on campus, and can’t spread it outwards. the sacrifice that our university is forcing us to make seems reactionary and unnecessary. it seems very unreasonable to me, but it also seems like i am a part of the overwhelming minority in this discussion. let me know your opinions.

i came across the mscss program at uw tacoma and the mscsse program at uw bothell. both the program looked similar to each other. hence, i wanted to ask anyone, who is a student at uw or otherwise, whether there are any differences between the two programs? and which program would be the best for my background?

we're building a new feature that lets you listen to short snippets of wisdom and actionable advice, specific to your issues and challenges, from people who've stood where you're standing. you can think of it as 2-5 minute mini-podcasts for what you're going through today.

for user testing, we're looking for current students or people who graduated from uw within the last 12 months. this will be a \~45 minute call with out head of product, [chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robeck/), who will ask all sorts of random questions about mental health and audio listening, and we will compensate $10 for the call. we also have some longer term involvement options that we can touch base on at the end of the call.

"[remote proctoring] protect your privacy, folks. hello!  

i hope remote learning is treating you fairly and that you are well in whatever location covid has stranded you.

one of my professors is requiring students to download the proctoru add-on for exams and other exercises. i was unfamiliar with it until recently (this is the first i have heard of it), but after researching it and reading what permissions it has, i can't help but feel like this is a massive violation of privacy. distrotube did [a feature on it](https://youtu.be/xrm1lxfn3vw), and i am honestly appalled. distro can be pretty intense, but his analysis is on-point. the letter he mentions from western sydney university can be found [here](http://cucfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/proctoru_2020-1.pdf).

from what i have found, not only does it collect sensitive personal information, proctoru (and like-minded services) can access your search history, processes, and system information. proctoru's [privacy policy](https://www.proctoru.com/privacy-policy) has been cleaned up or updated since distro made his video; a bold statement saying they would never sell your information is stapled to the top of the page. proctoru's privacy policy does (see: ""third party sharing"") clearly state that they have no qualms about transferring a student's information to third parties. so they will not sell your information, but they will hand it over if they are acquired or a similar situation arises, which is *almost* identical. also troubling to me is that the company records your audio and video, keeping it on record for ""as long as necessary"" (see: ""data retention""). 

i cannot imagine this sits well with many people, but perhaps i wear a thicker tinfoil hat than others. in a day and age where technology advances at breakneck speed and selling user information is a highly lucrative and common business, i cannot believe that this software is being used or even legal. has this issue been raised to the uw? is there a place *to* raise this issue? my greatest fear is reaching out to faculty about my skepticism, and having my professor fail me purely out of spite.

"should i apply to uw without any fine arts credits? sorry to be that annoying high school student...

but anyway, i'm an oos hs senior who's looking to apply to uw's cs program; however, i unfortunately have 0 fine arts credits, and i saw that uw basically requires 0.5 credits of fine arts (i took band in middle school for high school credit, but i don't think ms courses count towards this requirement).

however, i did see that uw sometimes still admits applicants without a fine arts credit, on the condition that they take one in the first year of college.

still though, is it even worth applying since i don't have this credit? will i be auto-rejected or will my chances get drastically reduced (especially since the acceptance rate for oos cs students is around 2%)?

"am i the only one who actually prefers zoom classes and is really enjoying this year? it might just be that im not a stem student and also have amazing professors so far but i love online college. first of all theres no commute. i have 8 ams four days a week this quarter but its fine because i get to roll out of bed at 7:55 and show up wrapped in a blanket with my breakfast at my desk. i can take a mental break during an unimportant time in the class like a breakout room and fiddle with my phone or pet my cats. presenting things to the class is a lot easier now that im just sharing my screen and focusing on the material instead of having 70 people in front of me staring at me. assignments and directions are so easy to manage because everything is laid out on canvas and i feel motivated to do them because im working from a place that im already very familiar with. i still get to live with my mum and do online school instead of having to work full time and pay rent in an expensive ass seattle apartment or overcharged paper walled dorm room. yes breakout rooms suck and having professors that dont know how to make a class function properly online sucks but right now im doing better than i ever have in high school and i still have tons of free time, honestly it baffles me when i see other people on here talk about how much they hate zoom classes",discussion

i’m not exactly sure what path to follow now since i only needed 10 more credits to complete my general requirements and was planning on majoring into accounting. since i did not get into the major and have to declare before winter quarter starts what should i do?

there is the option of finding a new major, however i already completed most of my general reqs for uw and the business school. this would mean giving up my dream of attending the business school and completing my bachelor’s degree by 2022.  

i can join an open major and try reapplying into the busines school, but i fear that i would not get in again. also, there is no open major i am exactly interested in. unless someone knows a certain open major that ties well with business.

there is also the option of transferring, but it is too late for most schools. i can also postpone my education but i feel like that would be my last resort if anything.

"planning to leave this state, and please dont post conseuling or get help posts, they are annoying i've always done well in high school but when i got to uw it was the first time i ever had a lot of money, and needless to say i'm a very much a cat person. (i only realized this now)

i've noticed many of my high school classmates some of them failed a class, graduating uw, (those who failed a class in hs probably did running start, and did well in it and transferred to uw).

i don't belong here in washington or seattle, apparently the vibe here and i are completely opposite. if you knew me in real life, i guarantee you'd hate me. (serious) please don't post things like ""oh hate is a strong word"", please i've dealt with too many people who are either secretive, sugar coat things too much, or even bully.

i dropped out of uw because i flopped after 3 successful satisfactory academic progress appeals, and after failing the 4th quarter (i needed to pass all 3 classes, but only passed 2) the 4th appeal form was denied. (so its 4 strikes you're out not 3).
in case you're wondering the really hard classes that i struggled with is math 124, math 125, music 116, astr 101, pols 201.

i didn't go back to community college, because i was dealing with some minor case of ptsd. well not really the ptsd you understand from military but you know, bullying and racism at uw campus.

honestly, i did use all 4 years of grant money, and somehow i flopped. i did okay in the first 2 years but couldn't decide on a major, only decided on one to remove the 105 credit rule.

could someone explain to me the difference between a dog person and a cat person? i figured not, this is the wrong subreddit for that.

i dunno maybe i didn't realize back in high school that i hated school. its something i learned in ap psychology called repressed emotion. or maybe its not even that, maybe i didn't know how to take care of myself but my mom knew what foods to feed me.

"faq for astr 101, 150, and ess 102 these are some pretty popular classes people take for either nw or i&s credits. i've taken all three so i wanted to provide some helpful information that i've seen people ask now-and-then on this sub.

these questions apply to all three classes (or where otherwise stated):

* are there math/physics pre-reqs?

>no. you need no knowledge or understanding of physics whatsoever for any of the classes. you don't need anything more than knowing arithmetic. **all physics and math necessary to pass the course will be covered in class or in class materials.**

* how much time lecture/study/etc per week?

>for all of these classes, you should expect to forfeit a mere 6-8 hours of your time most weeks.

* asynchronous?

>yes to all, but ess 102 moves a little faster, so i wouldn't postpone the work too much

* lectures necessary?

>100%. these classes are completely covered in the lectures. don't worry thought. that doesn't mean your hands are going to fall off at the end of each lecture. the profs are very clear in what information you should be taking away.

* how good are these online?

>the astronomy department has had astr 101 and 150 online since 2015, so it's super streamlined already. ess 102 doesn't have that same history, but it already seems to have most of the kinks out of the system. either way, all of these courses are super lenient in helping you get the grade you want.

* what is the homework like? (ess 102)

>**weekly labs that take 15-30 minutes.** the labs appear to be really long at first glance because they typically have a lot of questions, but most of the questions are asking you to either regurgitate information from the lectures or are asking for information that proves you did some of the physics activities.  
>  
>note: normally the class would be taken in person and thus would have labs at the university; using tools provided by the university to demonstrate the physics covered in the lectures. i'm taking the class right now and would say they have done a good job at creating labs that require nothing more than your cell phone, a ruler, and access to internet.

* what is the homework like? (astr 101, 150)

>astr 101/150 both have weekly discussion questions (dq), which you basically find a article that relates to a prompt, and then write a few sentences summarizing the article you found. i found astr 101 dq's took on average less time than astr 150. 150 is a lot more technical than 101, so sometimes it took me like an hour or two just to find an article that was long enough to write about. **expect 10 minutes or more on the dq**.  
>  
>on top of that there are ""labs"". astr 101 labs are generally more interactive and involve using some pretty fun programs. in those labs you basically answer questions that proved you messed around with the programs. both astr 101 and 150 also involve questions that involve using equations learned in class and writing short answers that prove you understand how the math/physics works. **expect 10-30 minutes on the labs.**

* do i need to read the textbook? (astr 101, 150)

>no. you do not need to read the textbook to pass, however, i found the textbook especially helpful  for getting more information on topics that weren't quite clear to me.

* is the textbook free? (astr 101, 150)

>astr 101 textbook pdf should be provided on your class canvas page for free. paper copies are also available for purchase (relatively cheap too!). astr 150: iirc textbook wasn't free, but also wasn't necessary either. so...

* how do i get help with the class?

>not exactly an faq, but something i want to make clear to people who haven't taken any astronomy related courses:  
>  
>the professors and tas who are in or associated with the astronomy department are **super** nice and helpful. it's a niche department at the uw, but i think that makes these people some of the most eager to make sure you understand the material.

&#x200b;

**course content:**

* astronomy 101
   * great detail into all of the laws of physics behind gravity and planetary motion; different types of stars and galaxies; and the origins of the universe and star formation
   * also covers good amount of the history of astronomy, but it is not really tested on
   * vague on formation of planets
* astronomy 150
   * very brief and vague on all of the information covered in astr 101. could potentially be confusing for people who have no understanding of the laws of physics, but that being said, you really only need to know how to use the equations. also this material makes up a fraction of the course as a whole.
   * great detail into the formation of our planets; the different types of planets, their chemical makeup, and why they contain said materials; how to identity the age of a planet's surface.
* ess 102
   * the first half of the class is basically a crash course on astr 150. thus the laws of physics and more general concepts which were briefly covered in 150, are covered exponentially faster in ess 102. that being said, you can always get help from the ta's.
   * the second half of the course is geared towards preparing you for the final project. thus the topics shift towards orbital mechanics and planetary research missions.

&#x200b;

**tl;dr**

* astr 101 can be taken by anyone. super easy class that is all about understanding the concepts (as opposed to the math and physics).
* astr 150 can be a little more challenging. since the course is designed for people with no background to be able to take the course, some necessary material covered in astr 101 has to be covered rapidly in order to make time for the prime material of the class. both classes offer the same credit, so i would recommend taking 101 before 150 if you can or have little to no understanding of how the universe work.
* ess 102 involves material from both astr 101 and 150, but mostly 150. since ess 102 has to involve all of that information in addition to orbital mechanics and planetary missions (like probes and robots), the course can feel super fast at times. that being said, just like the astr classes, this course technically provides you with all the information necessary to pass. it just comes down to how well you are able to absorb and understanding the material. if you need nw credits on top of the i&s provided by the class, i would recommend you take astr 150 at a minimum before this class.

"who do i contact about issues with a professors grading? tldr: i couldn’t answer for a 4th of the questions on my exam and my prof would not help me. who do i talk to?

i had an exam the other day and couldn’t understand a question. even worse the work for said question was needed for other questions and i effectively was unable to answer a forth of my test. i emailed my professor asking for clarification and never got anything back. i emailed again after the test asking if i could have some sort of retest or if i could have those questions ignored from my score and she refused and said she would not say anything else to me until grades were posted. 

i don’t know about everyone else, but any time a test question’s wording was confusing for students that question was either clarified or removed from grading. the one time i was testing at the drs and they couldn’t get ahold of the prof for clarification before the test ended they exempted the question for me. 

i have autism so it can be hard for me to understand or explain something when it comes to words. it’s not the first time i was unable to get clarification for a test question and then it happened that question was not counted for me.

plus several other students posted in piazza with confusion too. 

who do i talk do about this? 

some more details that might matter?:

this is for stat 311. my prof’s reasoning for rejecting my request was that it didn’t look like i understood the concepts for the question in the first place when i originally asked for clarification. from what i understood, the question asked for a description of the sampling distribution, and to find the mean and standard deviation for a histogram that showed the age range of voters vs what percent that age range made of all voters. what confused me was that it asked for the distribution of the 55-64 age voters, not the distribution of all voters, or so i understood it. so i messaged my prof asking if there was supposed to be a scatter plot for this age range because the question asked for a description of the distribution. i then understood it to mean i’m supposed to compare the distribution or in other words percent of voters that were ages 55-64 vs every other age ranger. of course you cant compute a mean or sd for that, but i ran out time, i just wanted to have proof that i was confused on how i was supposed to understand the question, and i needed to put down something. 

i emailed professor again and she said that because i asked her if i was supposed to have a scatter plot, i could have not understood the concept in the first place as this is a question about sampling distribution, which has nothing to do with scatter plots. the reason i asked for a scatter plot was because part of the question asked to describe the distribution which made me thing of that. regardless, as i mentioned in the above paragraph, i then understood the question to ask to compare the percentages of voters age 55-64 vs every other age range which is categorical and would technically give a sampling distribution. however i never mentioned it to her during the exam because she never responded back, what are the odds she would respond this time, and i never mentioned it after because i through it was irrelevant as the bottom line was that i was confused by the question and couldn’t actually answer it. i can’t explain it to her now because the last thing she said to me was that she would not respond anymore until grades were posted.

a little background. i am currently at a community college planning to transfer to uw for fall 2021. my grades currently average out to about a 3.7 gpa. by the time i finish my current quarter (fall 2020) it should average out to a 3.5 gpa ( two of my classes i did very well but in one of them i did not. 4.0, 3.4 and possibly a 3.0 or 2.9? depending how i do on my final). i believe my gpa is in good standing. not to give out to much details, i also have an extensive amount of leadership experience, community building, volunteering, extracurricular activities, and overall, very involved with my school. i think this should also help me with my chances of getting in. 

as a side note, i went to a technical college to be trained in a specific field but the field isn't related to business. it is a college and you're also graded so i'm thinking when i apply that they would also want to see this? they asked for all colleges attended. my grades from this place aren't great, quite literally, they were on the edge of passing/failing. d's across the board with a few c's. this was during my much younger days where i didn't really care what my grades were as long as i passed. 


so, my questions are these:
- if i happen to have an average gpa by the time i apply ( let's say 3.3) but an extensive amount of leadership, extracurricular activities, etc. do you think my chances of being admitted are still good?

- in terms of writing my personal statement to foster ( separate from general uw admissions) how do i explain my poor grades from my technical college with out saying ""yeah, my grades there were bad but that was younger me""? this one im really concerned about if they factor it in and question why its so low.

"can i get into uw postbac for bio? # i am a french major with 3.74 gpa and 204 credits looking to apply to uw bio as a postbac. 

**positives**:

* my overall gpa is 3.74, my major gpa (french) is 3.91, and my bio/chem prereqs gpa (likely the most important factor) is 3.08 (disgusting, i know. i didn't have a chem/bio background so i got nuked in the intro classes.) i'm also a member of phi betta kappa honors society.
* in terms of progress, i completed bio 180, 200, and 220, and chem 145 and 152. i also finished math 124. 
* my current winter registration is for bio 361: genomics, bio 354 and chem 162.  
* i am also aware that statements of purpose are a huge deciding factor regarding acceptance.  i would describe my writing as decently competent, though i am mostly insecure because of my bio/chem gpa and high credit number. 

**negatives**:

* i don't have any research and my last two lab classes were online so i don't have much lab experience. 

# my questions are: 

1) do i have a decent chance of getting in,  or should i just assume the worst?  

2) if my credentials do not look that bad, should i focus on graduating asap with the highest gpa possible, or should i try and finish more upper division bio classes? 

3) will having completed more biology classes (i.e. a higher percentage of the bio degree) undergrad make me more favorable as a postbac applicant? 

# my backup plans:

**1) transfer to a community college and try to complete a bio degree there/reapply to uw as postbac after finishing more bio degree requirements**

if my chances of getting into bio are pretty negligible, then it may be wiser to graduate immediately instead of trying to take bio 361 and 354, in order to take advantage of my gpa as it currently is. 

the downside to this method is that, to my knowledge, while prereqs like physics and ochem are offered at community college, upper class division bio is not (though i could be wrong about this assumption).  

**2) finish bio requirements at a community college and try to take upper division bio classes at uw**

there is the alternative of trying to take them as a non-degree student, but i do not think taking the upper division bio classes as a non-matriculated student is possible as they have a very low dropout rate (i say this as someone who just barely managed to register for them and had some difficulty).  also, while i have been considering the premed pathway, i really want a degree more than to just finish the prereqs because i am aware of the high rejection rate of med school applicants and i do not feel secure just banking my luck on a low possibility. 

overall, i just want to focus on obtaining a bio degree (preferably in physiology).  i have filed some transfer applications to other universities (and am considering community college for basic required classes), and i've been recommended to look into grad school and master's programs, but if possible i would like to apply for postbac. 

**3) desperately try to get more research/lab experience, study for the bio gre, and apply to uw bio grad school**

i don't feel super lucky with this option because i'm a french major instead of a bio undergrad.

**4) apply for a bio master's degree**

see above. also lack of research/lab fieldwork. 

**5) do a complete 180 and take the lsat and apply to law school.**

you might ask: um, so do you like law? and the answer is...uhhh...i mean, i liked legally blonde well enough, i guess. this option is a sort of a desperate shot in the dark, a desperate man's last cry for help.  this option also would probably require me to drop all my current classes in order to keep my gpa as high as it currently is. 

**6) apply for the uw bsn**

i haven't looked totally into this option, so i don't even know if i can be admitted or if they are going to reject me due to credit limit regardless of my gpa like the bio department. chances are, i might not even be able to be admitted due to my 204 credits.

my next article is about whether your instructors addressed the riots at the capitol building in class, or if it felt like business as usual for you. there’s kind of two parts to this article, (a) whether or not the events were addressed, and (b) whether or not the events should have been addressed. i’ll also be discussing to what extent current political events should dictate our classroom material.

"physics 123 or 116? can anyone with any experience in either class weigh in on how they thought of their 3rd physics quarter?

i am currently debating which physics i should take since my major no longer only needs phys 121 and 122, but i will need the third physics class for dental school requirements.

would it be better to take phys 116 in order to possibly get a higher gpa,  or will it not matter since they are the same in difficulty? i took both phys 121 and 122 online and it was rough

also would it matter to dental schools if i switched to algebra based physics from calc-based physics?

this was after i auditioned to major in music in september and didn't get accepted on the instrument of my preference.

this quarter started off promising, i was hoping to find my motivation for academics again, but after a few weeks of missing and assignment here and there and occasionally missing a lecture because it feels pointless to get out of bed, i've found myself failing 2 classes again. i even took only 12 credits this quarter and it's still too much to handle. i only have enough in me for one class. i've tried again and again to put as much effort into all my classes online as i did when they were in person and i've come the conclusion that after this long i just can't. if they didn't introduce the s/ns option for quarters taken during the global pandemic i would have probably dropped out by now.

"protecting the health of students learning in different time zones: a letter to the uw administration *this message is being sent to ana mari cauce (the president of uw), the daily of uw, and the general audience.*

dear uw administrators,

i am writing this letter to raise awareness of the challenges on the health of student learning in different time zones. in this letter, i present those challenges and potential solutions to mitigate those problems. i invite the uw administration to take actions to address those challenges to build a more inclusive global community.

**executive summary**

amid the pandemic, many students have to learn in different time zones synchronously under current university policy, compromising their health. university policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced to protect the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones. established policies such as the elimination of attendance for grading need to be enforced. policy changes should focus on making time schedules of assessments and discussion sessions more flexible.

**background**

amid covid-19 pandemic, students have to stay at home and learn remotely in different time zones inside and outside of the us. most international students, especially, experience drastic time differences when trying to attend lectures and exams live from their home countries.

attending classes live with hours of difference is not easy. for students studying in hawaii, a 8:30 am pst class translates to attendance at 6:30 am local time. for students studying in east asia, a 10:30 am pst class could mean staying up late 2:30 pm \[correction: am\] late night every weekday. such time difference not only translates to disadvantages when learning materials and taking exams, it also disturbs the students’ circadian clock, causing adverse effects on the student’s physical and mental health.

the adverse effects are not theoretical, nor are they overstated. on february 8th, rensselaer polytechnic institute grieves the passing of kaijie zhang, “a first-semester freshman studying remotely from his family home in wuxi, jiangsu, china” \[1\]. taking classes at night and its associated adverse effects are allegedly the main cause of this tragedy. to prevent such tragedies from happening at uw and for the health of all students learning in different time zones, university policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced. i am confident that these problems will be addressed because “the health and safety of our students, staff, faculty and academic personnel is our university’s highest priority,” writes our president ana mari cauce in her message “the safety of our community is our highest priority” \[2\].

**problems and recommendations**

*time schedule planning*

while synchronous classes with diverse time schedules and asynchronous classes could solve the problem, they are not realistic in large scale because of limited teaching resources and limited learning experience, respectively. however, i suggest the university to explicitly encourage the planning of lecture and quiz sections (if they have multiple sections) at very different times.

for instance, many courses currently offers section a at 9:30 am and section b at 10:30 am, providing students little time flexibility. instead, the policy could encourage planning of section a at 9:30 am and section b at 4:30 pm, accommodating for students from different time zones.

i understand that such strategy may not work for all courses because of limitations such as their sizes, instructor availability, and time conflicts. nevertheless, a small change in the schedule could benefit a large population of students. in addition, ferpa-compliant recordings of synchronous lecture should be required to be uploaded to the cloud for students all students for reference, giving all student the possibility of asynchronous learning.

*exam policy*

another issue that students learning from different time zones face is awkward exam schedule. if a course is offered synchronously, regardless whether its materials are posted for asynchronous learning, its exams are usually strictly synchronous, without exceptions (other than that required by university policy). for example, a student studying from east asia may have to take an exam 3:30 am local time at night for an unnegotiable exam time of 11:30 am pst. again, such late time is not only an disadvantage to academic performance, but it is also poisonous to the students’ physical and mental health. this is easily understandable: if student do not expect instructors to teach late night to accommodate for students in different time zones, then instructors should not expect students in different time zones to take examinations late night.

as a concrete example, many exams in the department of chemistry must be taken synchronously, without exceptions for students learning in different time zones, because instructors “see less issues with academic ethics & integrity if all students take the exam concurrently.” even worse, it is quoted as a departmental policy. this would not be a problem if classes were in person, but remote instruction has to consider of time zone differences to be inclusive of students learning in different time zones.

synchronous exam policies have to be changed. i recommend exams for remote learning to have a time window of 24 hours to start the exam, providing students from different time zones an equal opportunity to perform in their time zones. indeed, such policy may raise concerns on academic integrity; however, policies should not punish students who did nothing wrong: the time zone students are in are not in their control. in contrast, the choice to adhere to the honor code and take the exam with honesty is in the hands of every student. in addition, student who decide to cheat in asynchronous exams is likely to cheat in synchronous section regardless, having no correlation with whether students learning from different time zones should have a fair time to take the exam. therefore, exam policies need to be changed so that every student has an equal opportunity to demonstrate their performance and a healthy schedule without late night classes.

*enforcement of policies*

after appropriate revision to the university policies, those policies need to be strictly enforced so that the students can benefit from those policies to have a flexible learning experience. if no enforcement is placed and no feedback channel is available for students, students would not be benefitted from those policies. thus, i recommend the university to establish ways for students to provide feedback and express concerns on remote teaching related to course policies to the administration level (independent to those mid-quarter survey that are for instructional feedback).

*attendance policy*

here, i present one example of the consequence of the lack of policy enforcement: the attendance policy is not practiced by instructors. the university policy on remote teaching has a clear guideline on grading synchronous attendance: “attendance – don’t factor in attendance as part of grading” \[3\]. however, many instructors still grade attendance directly or indirectly. take an organic chemistry course as an example, its grading takes synchronous poll everywhere responses as 4% of the total grade, stating that “you will only be able to answer the questions during lecture, not while watching the lectures on panopto later on,” forcing students to attend synchronously without considering students learning in different time zones. as a solution, i recommend quarterly inspection of course syllabus as a part of policy enforcement, in the hope that instructors will follow university policies, just like students should follow university policies, too.

**conclusion**

in conclusion, university policies need to be revised and enforced so that the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones can be protected. the change to university policies can also provide more equitable examination opportunities. i invite the uw administration to respond by taking concrete actions to improve the policies, building a more inclusive community.

"where did the valentine's cheap candy go? so, this is incredibly mundane, but feb 15th has always been a bright point in my winters-- valentines chocolates get marked way down after the holiday, and i'll usually buy a bunch of sweets to pep myself up. 

but this year, i haven't seen much of anything: i scoped out the bartells on the ave during my ""once a week outing"" last monday, as they're usually fantastic for seasonal sweets, but over half their candy aisle was (already!) dedicated to easter stuff! no luck when i stopped by the trader joe today either, though that's not as surprising. haven't been able to check out the target yet-- has anyone been down the hill to the qfc? 

i imagine this is just another side effect of le plague times, it just strikes me as odd that i didn't even really see valentine's *displays*. maybe i've just completely missed them somehow?

because my whole family and i are moving to seattle this summer, i just wanted to know if i'd be qualified as a washington resident when i apply this fall. i'm planning to enter udub in the fall of 2022 as a freshman. some people say that i need to pay taxes in washington state for 2 years to be considered as a resident of washington state, but on the udub websites, it ways i just need to relinquish some ties with former states and reside in the state for a year prior to the first day of quarter. so, just need some clearance.",discussion

edit: problem has been solved without needing to call the it service people :) all i had to do was go to the ""find your uw netid"" site, sign in using my uw application email address and password, and reset my password without using any student id or husky id numbers or anything like that. i found my netid using the application account and tried to reset my password then realized it was a password i had ""previously used.""",admissions

"psych major essay tips? hey all! i'm about to apply for the psych major and have questions about the two essays ([https://psych.uw.edu/undergraduate/prospective-students/admissions](https://psych.uw.edu/undergraduate/prospective-students/admissions)).

1.  what type of essay is the department seeking for the first response? do  they want a list of my psych-related achievements (i've done a lot of  science fairs, 1 published article, 1 tedx talk, 1 psych conference talk  + poster, & a lot of panel talks)? an ""i knew i wanted to be a  therapist when..."" story? bulletpoints of how psychology is a theme in  my studies?

2. how much wiggle room is there for the math  course grade? my gpa for the psych prereqs is strong (3.85), but i got  only a c- in my math course (at community college) and i am failing it  now, on a retake. i have always needed accommodations, via iep, to learn  algebra, and in college via learning remotely that's impossible. i  doubt i can get a c if i retake it a third time, at uw, and at this  point it's the biggest hurdle keeping me from entering the major. the  psych admissions counselor told me there's no wiggle room at all, but if  so, why have this second question? is there any hope for me? should i  talk to carrie (or someone else) in the department directly?

3.  i am entering as a freshman in autumn 2021, but will have enough  credits (because of running start) to bump up to junior status. i know  from reading this page that it's best/easiest to be admitted into the  major in the autumn. the psych major webpage currently says *""the application cycle for winter will open at some point during the week of march 22-26.""* is autumn admission into the major already closed? is it futile for me to try?

[0.06%](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/07/13/covid-risk) of the deaths due to covid in america have been 18-39 year-olds. comparatively, 1.8% of the [2018-2019 flu deaths](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127799/influenza-us-mortality-rate-by-age-group/) were 18-49 year-olds.

"hcde: graduate school? hi everyone,

i wanted to post this question because i feel that i get many mixed responses regarding graduate school for people going into the ux field. as an undergrad in the hcde program, i was considering applying for the department's masters program, but i'm worried about the prospect of paying off student loans that i feel will accumulate too much over time (note: im a oos student). 

a lot of people i've talked to say that graduate school is unnecessary, particularly in the ux field, and developing a strong portfolio is much preferred. however, my question is that wouldn't going to graduate school strengthen your overall portfolio and resume? additionally, when searching for careers, it seems many of the positions seek for people with more work experience and preferably a degree higher than that of a bs. i feel that i would stand no chance compared to much more experienced candidates with refined portfolios when it comes to the competition for jobs. 

it also seems that much of the ""prestige"" of the hcde dept. lies in their master's programs as i can't seem to find too much information regarding the bachelor's program. maybe i'm wrong. but, i just feel really lost about this subject because i've really yet to figure out my career track, let alone figure out if graduate school is something i should consider. i'm panicking because i'm going to be a junior soon, and i have no idea what i want to do with my degree or have even started a solid portfolio. 

for hcde people, how difficult was it to find a job, particularly with a bs degree? is graduate school worth the financial investment? for those going into hcde ms program, why did you choose to do so? what differences are there in bs and ms programs for hcde? do you have any advice on how to get started on your portfolio early?

"impostor syndrome vs. just not being in the right environment i see a lot of students bolstering each other by calling impostor syndrome at everything. i find that toxic, to be honest — not in a way that is purposefully or intrinsically harmful, but a lot like “toxic positivity”. you’re trying to be helpful, but it actually does the opposite.

i think that every student should (and usually does) have a deep moment of reflection when things are continuously not going well. sometimes, really great things come from it! people change their majors and their gpa shoots up and they find themselves happier and more passionate with their field. sometimes, people take a quarter off. sometimes, people transfer colleges. and sometimes, at an extreme, people drop out - whether it be to pursue an independent affair, preserve their mental health, take care of their finances, or re-think their academic and career goals.

not every instance of self-doubt is impostor syndrome, and i don’t think we should brush everything off as such. i think we should be having deeper conversations, self-reflections, and explorations. 

it might seem right to placate your friends from the outset with “easy” explanations, but we should be honest and reflective with the people we care about more often. and, of course, a lot of the time, i’m sure that it probably is imposter syndrome.

1)food: i'm a us citizen but i've lived in india for most my life and getting good indian food is crucial to me

2. experienced applying from out-of-state (i am from the bay area) and have any information on what an average fa package may look like for a low-income independent student. the website calculator seems as though it is for undergrad, unless i am interpreting it incorrectly. any insight on rent or family living situations? childcare? on-campus vs. off-campus housing?

3. could share their graduate (master’s degree specifically) experience with me. i am scared to apply because of so many reasons, including the fact that i have not been in school for almost 2 years after graduating. i am worried that i will have nothing to offer in merit alone, as i spent the last two years raising my daughter as a sahm and moving across the states with my husband. i have work experience since i graduated high school but i don’t feel confident that my lack of volunteer work or internships during these two years will be looked at positively.

"university gpa before military service and applying afterwards first, i apologize for bringing up what has likely been plastered all over this sub with varying personal context.

&#x200b;

for background, after high school graduation, i applied and was accepted to the university of arizona. through a complete and utter lack of motivation and self discipline, i preformed extremely poorly, ultimately withdrawing after 2 years. i joined the navy almost immediately afterwards to take some of the burden off of my parents, who were supporting me entirely financially, as well as my younger brothers who were just starting college themselves.

&#x200b;

my military service gave me plenty of time to figure out what i was doing with myself and how i could fix what went wrong before. as banal as it sounds, i believe i've been able to build a foundation of self respect and work ethic that i didn't have before i enlisted and i want to prove that to myself by going back to and finishing a degree.

&#x200b;

because of my previous performance at the ua and the impression of me that my transcript would undoubtedly give, i'm admittedly very nervous of the fact that my application could be rejected due to my shortcomings in the past. my plan is to go to a wa cc for 2 years before applying as a transfer student to the uw with the intention of maintaining a competitive gpa there.

&#x200b;

i know that a lot of this post probably seems ""poor me""ish and desperate but i really am a bit scared and i wanted to give some info of where i'm coming from with my question. with the end of my 5 year active duty contract coming up in less than 2 weeks, i want to be sure i'm making a decent decision to do all of this.

&#x200b;

have any of you had a similar experience with doing poorly either in high school or otherwise and successfully applying? what are the chances that my previous grades would keep me from being accepted regardless of how well i do at cc? are there any specific steps i should take beyond putting my full effort into my gpa to improve my chances?

"we're a team of 4th yrs who are making a new app for campus social life. but before we launch at uw, we're hoping to hear honest critiques & feedback on how we can improve it for your campus! all of us have dealt with the struggles of finding and connecting with like-minded people on campus. it's never been easy to make meaningful connections when you're on a campus with thousands of other kids. but we decided to take up the challenge and build a platform that could actually help change that.

our solution is called den, an organized approach to finding campus roommates, friends, dates, events, and more. the platform isn't near its final form, but here is what we've built so far: [***current version.***](https://den.university/r/udub)

we're still cleaning up minor bugs in the app, but our focus right now is just hearing students' thoughts on what we've built so far. any feedback, positive or negative, is super helpful! the current app is far from perfect, but listening to critiques is the best way we can improve and build something that students will enjoy using :)

"hansee 3 person suite vs mcmahon double room + general north campus advice hello! 
incoming freshman here. 
i'm considering north campus dorms...

out of the 6 dorms, 4 are extremely similar in pricing and dorm layout... and i'm not too sure about these 4 cuz a 4 person or 3 person suite i feel is pretty small and not worth it??? the doubles and singles here are just outta my reach :(

*i'm not striking of these 4 options, still considering them*

so the remaining two are hansee and mcmahon.

♤ in hansee, i'm considering a 3 person suite which is 6k per year. i just want to know your opinions. 

i've heard hansee is very quiet and everyone is not that social??? but a 3 person suite will be more social i think?
do many freshmen live in hansee?

also it has a bicycle storage room (unlike mcmahon) inside which is a big plus for me. i plan to get a cycle to go to class as well as for recreation.

♤ in mcmahon, i'm looking at the double room which is 7k per year.

i've heard mcmahon is very social due to the cluster system. do many freshmen live in mcmahon?

there is no cycle storage... we have to keep it outside the bldg on the rails... very likely to be stolen.

☆☆☆ the thing is i like quiet environments to some extent, where i can focus on academics... not extremely noisy and stuff.
hansee and mcmahon seem to be on two extreme ends. i believe some sociability is important which a 3 or 4 person suite in hansee will facilitate???☆☆☆

i'm sorry for the long post but it would be very helpful if you can drop me your opinions. 

should i choose hansee, mcmahon or any of the remaining four dorms?",student life

first, i’m an incoming freshman so i’m not a student at uw yet. i don’t fully understand everything around this issue but from the information i’ve gathered i’ve come to the following conclusions:

1) the asuw president overstepped by sending out that mass email. i’m a bit up in the air on whether she should be recalled but i think i’m leaning towards the opinion that she should.
2) i’m very disappointed in the asuw as an institution. they don’t seem to reflect the student body and i would like to see some reforms put in place to ensure representatives actually represent the students.
3) the asuw needs to stop complaining and start getting stuff done. college is way way way too expensive and the asuw should organize around bringing this cost down and improving the quality of life for students. 
4) the daily’s cartoon wasn’t racist. it was just a list of campus landmarks and was in no way tied to candidates. if, however, the daily had drawn that cartoon so that the landmarks each corresponded to a specific candidate so that the animals corresponded to bipoc candidates, that’d be racist. 

that’s just my 2 cents that nobody asked for. i might run for asuw next year just to raise these issues ngl

"night reflection survey results and findings many respondents were interested in the results of the night reflection (reflection in bed before sleeping) survey, so here they are! thank you again to everyone who submitted the survey :)

key findings:

1. for the majority of people, reflection was intrusive to their efforts to sleep.
2. most people consider night reflection to be a negative experience and give them negative emotions.

the age of respondents varied from 12 to 60 years old, with most participants (as expected) between 18 and 22 years old.

"amath 35x or math 20x series hi all,

i'm currently a freshman engrud hoping for meche placement in the fall. since meche requires amath 301, i figured i should consider doing the optional replacement for math 20x with the amath 35x series which would guarantee me the amath minor with no extra work (assuming i'm placed into meche). i have some questions about the difference between the two different tracks, though. i was wondering what is the difficulty difference between amath and math for these series, as well as if amath 351 requires knowledge of python/matlab yet. i was planning to take amath 351 this summer since almost any engineering placement i'm interested in allows for it to fill a grad requirement, and then taking amath 301 in the fall since it isn't a guarantee i'll need that course if i don't get into meche. does amath 351 rely on python/matlab knowledge, or is it fairly similar to math 207 (307)? thanks in advance!",academics

in the month since then i've made a ton of improvements and added more features/data, including two suggestions from when i first posted it:

* there's now an option for a new flow with only courses from a specific curriculum e.g. amath (from /u/jimsupawish).

* bothell/tacoma courses and curricula are now available (from /u/endendragon).

some remaining problems:

* how to implement either/or logic in the graph. this is a big one, and will probably take a while.

* positioning when adding new courses or using undo/redo is still buggy.

"random advice for freshmen here is a random jumble of advice and info i wish i knew/thought of before coming to uw (much of this is dorm related)

 

* 8 am in high school is very different from 8 am in college. unless you are absolutely sure that you are a morning person--like the type of person who wakes up at 6 a.m.--do not take classes before 10 a.m.! 
* get the lowest level dining account. if you find you need more money you can always level your account up, but if you start with an expensive dining account and you don't spend the money, you're screwed.
* you might not like your roommates. it's fine. even if you talk to them for months before, sometimes it just doesn't work out and that's okay. it happens to a lot of people.
* closet measurements: that rack for hanging your clothes is 32 inches. (hope this helps y'all not overpack)
* worried about storage space? grab yourself one of these bad boys at a very reasonable price from target: https://www.target.com/p/11-8-cube-organizer-shelf-room-essentials-153/-/a-51256587?preselect=15113339#lnk=sametab 
* don't know who needs to hear this, but you do not need to bring that many pairs of shoes. 
* bring several towels. ideally thinner ones so they dry properly.
* clothes you *need*:  a good rain jacket. ideally two. two pairs of rain shoes, either waterproof or water-resistant. that's right, you will thank me for this.
* don't bring tide pods. the washers don't get hot enough for them to melt. 
* bringing posters? scotch mounting putty works great for hanging them on dorm walls! tape… not so much. 
* get a minifridge, get a good one! you do not really need a microwave, every dorm floor has two microwaves so you're not going to have to walk super forward to access a fancy and high-quality microwave. 
* you will in fact need a power cord--the outlets are few and far spread so if you plan on having a lamp, your computer, a clock, and phone plugged in at your desk, you will need this. 
* buy one of those eye masks for sleeping and practice sleeping in it. well look stupid and it's not the most comfortable at first, you and your roommate will thank me when it's 2 a.m. and you want to sleep, and they need to have the lights on so they can stay awake and cram study for a test.  no matter the brightness or what time of day it is, you put that sucker on, and it's pitch black and perfect for sleeping.
* there is no ac in the dorms. you have a heater in your room but the highest i can go is 74 degrees. it autoshuts on at 55 degrees. thus far it has not gotten hot enough that i would want ac but just a heads up it isn't an option.
* bring lights. lamps, string lights, anything. the dorm lighting sucks and the rooms are so gloomy, dark, and depressing. 
* there will be very little daylight during the winter months. some days, if you sleep in late and wake up at 3 p.m, you open your blinds to find it is already dark outside. during these months make sure you get up and experience a few hours of sunlight a day or you will get seasonal depression. it's very real, and it sucks. 
* aleks is evil. learn to fear and hate the name, chances are you'll understand later. 
* sometimes there are homeless people wandering around west campus. most of them are chill, some of them are weird. sometimes the front of the dorm buildings smells like human urine.
* the dining hall food sucks. buy yourself a pan, pot, spatula, knife, mixing bowl, and cutting board from target or ikea or somewhere in case you ever cook. that's honestly about all you need....
* bring a vacuum. and a duster. the dorm's floors get so dirty so fast, and the room gets so damn dusty from the vents. 
* do not overload your schedule! college classes are a lot more self-taught than high school. balance is important, for everyone hard class you're taking, balance it with a passion class or a fun class your first quarter to allow yourself breathing room to adjust. pair your chem class with a film appreciation class or psychology of human sexuality, and your bio class with ceramics or creative writing. you get the idea.
* do not hook up with someone on your dorm hall floor, rookie mistake and it is awkward for the whole year. i did not do it but i know too many people who did eek
* spreadsheet, spreadsheet, spreadsheet! canvas and it's annoying to use in my opinion, the only way i kept from forgetting assignments as i spent hours the first day of school making a spreadsheet ordering all the assignments, tests, quizzes, and projects to speak to a spreadsheet organized by date. then throughout the quarter i just stayed ahead and crossed stuff off the list.",advice

""information we have received from the registrar indicates that you are enrolled at the uw either as a non-matriculated student, or in a program that is not eligible for financial aid (unclassified 5th year, certificate program, ineligible fee-based program, visiting student, etc.). due to this, our office cannot award financial aid to you while you are enrolled in this program of study.  please disregard any requests we may have sent you.  if you have been recently admitted as a matriculated student in an eligible degree or certificate program, contact our office to see if your status has been updated."" 

my question is, am i not getting any financial aid whatsoever because of my major? i was not warned of this when doing their information session and kind of stressed out because i don't know if i'm able to pay for tuition out-of-pocket. any help or advice on loan programs that can help pay toward tuition is appreciated, thank you.",advice

just want you to know you’re the best ta i have ever had. you’re kind, patient, always available, knowledgeable, prepared, professional, fun, and helpful. you care so much about your students’ learning and success. your passion in chemistry helped me grow my passion for chemistry. 

your powerpoint slides are more than amazing. they’re really artistic and informational. the examples you gave in class to connect chemistry to real world problems and industry made the class enjoyable. i can’t imagine how much time and effort you put into those slides.

you always replied email so quickly and with detailed explanation. there was one time i emailed you at 1 pm asking a question about the lab, you not only replied immediately and answered my question but also said ‘go to sleep, don’t stay up late’. it just shows how friendly and caring you are as a ta.

for our final project, you had made such an effective learning environment. i just can’t imagine how you would meet one-on-one with more than 20 students every week to chat about our progress. my friends in other sections said they were put into groups of 5-6 to talk about their project. you also made the project so enjoyable by creating a kahoot game instead of making us presenting.

on top of all the above, you did all of those with your passion for teaching and cares for your students. i know you’re a first year grad student, who is busy with taking classes, doing research, and life.

then covid happened and everything and i mean everything went down hill. i have failed many classes at this point. especially those in chem. i'm supposed to be pre med and i do still really want to be a doctor but i don't know if i'll make it. my gpa is still somehow above 3.0. but does anyone think i could really comeback from this? like, i feel as though i have to change my whole life now
the steps i'm taking now to help is:
1) taking off summer quarter because i need a break to reset
2) making sure i have no roommates this next year (i've had some awful ones)
3) going to see a therapist for mental health issues
4) getting a job so i can have money for backup

"i'm genuinely not okay hi dubfam. i hope summer's been going well for you guys.

this post is going to be all over the place because i don't even know where to start in terms of remedying my situation (i think it's hopeless to be honest, but i've got to get this all off my chest) so i'm very sorry in advance.

the 2020-2021 year was my freshman year at uw. since i had come in from a highly competitive public school in california with a history of nearly all a's, i did not think that this year would turn out the way that it did. though it's no excuse, i would say that my experience with having to adapt to college life in the context of a life-changing pandemic had significant repercussions on my mental health, and so my academics have been beyond poor in my opinion for the entirety of the year.

autumn quarter ended with a 3.6 in my bioe intro class (i'm not dtc either, hence why i wholeheartedly believe i've now sentenced myself to go nowhere in life) but i decided to s/ns the rest of my classes that term (rest were s's). i thought that would be the end of my dissatisfaction with my performance, but winter quarter took a turn for the worst—i failed all of my classes that quarter, got on academic probation, and subsequently chose to retake the winter courses for the spring term, which i now deem to be a fuck-up as well (2.8, 3.0, and 0.0/r).

i was considering making use of the former quarter drop (fqd) policy for winter quarter because my performance was especially poor; sometime near midterm season, i was roofied and consequently hospitalized—i actually almost passed away (which caused a lot of psychological trauma) but, given the nature of the situation, i feel as if the circumstances are a bit murky and so i've been hesitant to follow through with the entirety of the petition process because i feel like it'll all be in vain.

i'm so sorry for the pathetic ranting but i am truly broken at this point and i am thinking of ending it. i'm not even able to register for autumn 2021 at this point because of administrative holds. honestly, i'm not too sure about what my intentions even are with this post—part of me is desperately searching for reassurance and hope, but i'm crying myself to sleep every night because i know that not only is engineering completely out of the question, but that i'll most likely have to drop out. this is not who i am. i used to be an honor roll student in high school but now i'm on my own with all of my financial aid revoked, planning out how i'm going to leave my family and friends without hurting them too much.

&#x200b;

edit: i've already began the process of trying to lift my registration/financial holds by speaking with my adviser but it's all still... so hopeless

&#x200b;

update: thank you all so much for the overwhelming support and kindness! so far my registration hold has been lifted and the fqd process seems to be moving in the right direction. my academic standing is now in the satisfactory range again, and my focus has now shifted towards remediating  academically and getting back on the right track.",academics

changes since last month:

* more context menu options

* new minimap

* new ability to edit course data

* new option to add courses from text search, which should make it easy to add batches of electives/concentration courses.

* new course table to view all course data in one place.

* added natural sciences, environmental, and informatics majors. but, i'm pretty sure the [data](https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) is outdated, so check before using.

* updated [degree course lists](https://github.com/awu43/prereq-flow-degrees) with course names.

what's still missing:

* grouping — unfortunately, the library i'm using to generate the graphs doesn't support grouping at the moment so there's no easy way to represent a condition like ""10 credits from approved electives"".

for those who don't know how the physics exams work - we have 20 questions, each 5 points so essentially each question is worth 5%. after looking at my exam, i realized that i somehow made 3 of the stupidest mistakes ever which caused me to lose 15 points and hence 15% (i got 75% but could've gotten 90%). i don't even know how i missed those because i got them correct when i redid them and i have been feeling really guilty.

now, every time i try to study physics, that keeps popping up in my brain and i feel like its eating m alive - honestly.

i just feel so guilty and am so scared about the next exam and what might happen there. because of my bad score here, i need to ace my next exam so that i can still get the grade that i want/need in that class.

engr 101 & gen st 199, math 224 (nw), m e 123 (vlpa), ess 102 (i&s), astr 301 (nw).

i feel like i could probably do well even with 17 credits, but i'm worried that i might miss out on opportunities outside of class. looking on uwgrades, i think this would probably come out to around 32 hours per week. in any case, if any of you have been in a similar situation or dealt with a similar schedule, i would really appreciate any advice, and thanks in advance!",advice

"my advice for incoming freshmen attending uw (part 1) going to college is not an easy thing because you'll face numerous invisible challenges starting your first quarter or semester. and your first year is the foundation for the entire undergraduate career, so some silly mistakes will cost you. as a rising sophomore this fall at the university of washington, here are my genuine advice on how to effectively and joyfully spend your first year. i hope it's helpful!

​

# 1. start connecting your classmates before the year begins

you'll very likely to find the group chat on the internet after you accepted the enrollment, or even before the admission cycle closed. social media platforms like discord, facebook, or loopchat usually have a big group chat that includes every member of the incoming class (if they get admitted), and some of the people in the group chat may still waitlisted. getting to know each other from here is a great opportunity, you will know people with various majors. later in the spring, you'll start to apply for the housing, and the best way is to reach out people, as many as possible. having your first group of college friends makes you advantaged than those who do not. simply, don't wait until the fall and panic.

​

# 2. do not pack your entire home to the dorm

as an international student from china, i was worried that i cannot get specific items abroad when packing for my first year of studying in 2016, so i literally squeezed as many things as possible into two 28-inch suitcases. unfortunately, my assumption was wrong. i can purchase all my stationaries, cookware, bedding supplies, and any general items at walmart, target, and many grocery stores. i understand you concern about cannot getting something you desire, but the university of washington itself is urban-setting, which you can get things you need within walkable distance. lastly, things like power outlet, bedding supplies, and clothes are made differently in the u.s., and i do not want you to unwillingly throw your stuff away if it doesn't fit.

​

# 3. the best way to beat homesickness is stay active

if you're an international or out-of-state student, you will probably hit a wall at sometime during the fall or early winter due to a combination of factors, which could be homesickness. this could happen anytime during the year when you feel unable to handle the cultural differences, language barriers, academic pressure, and loneliness. at this point, don't freak out. negative emotions and attitudes can adversely affect your mental health and academic success. now it's the time to talk to people around you, attend collegiate athletic events, join the student organizations, and do not stay inside your dorm 15 hours a day! social life and self-adjustment are the only ways can help you. once you get engaged, you will realize time pasts really fast.

​

# 4. take the entire core sequence courses if possible

lots of public flagship universities may have introductory sequence courses, especially for stem subjects, and those classes can be extremely challenging compared to some upper-division classes. the math 124-5-6 (introductory calculus sequence, also called math 12x) at uw is known for its rigor and students with ap calculus scores can directly jump into math 125 or math 126. but i strongly recommend you restart the sequence even you have ap calculus credits. math 12x courses are taught twice as fast as typical high school ap classes with higher expectations, if you don't get used to the college teaching style, you will not doing great even you already know the entire curriculum of math 12x. you need study skills to survive.

​

# 5. tenured professors are not always have fantastic teaching skills

sadly, you're less likely to have a ""teacher"" at uw or any large public universities, especially in stem classes. universities like uw and uc always hire professors to do specific researches for their departments, and the departments rarely offer specialized training on teaching. this results some professors are expertise in their fields but have zero experiences on teaching. they can teach classes, but not as good as your high school calculus teacher. they are paid for the research, not all the classes taught during the academic year. you cannot flip the professor's teaching style, so i suggest you either switch to another section, work hard with your classmates, or wait till next academic term. complaining doesn't solve anything.

​

# 6. make friends with common interests and hobbies only

college campus is huge enough to have people from different cultural backgrounds, so it's obvious that we will meet lots of ""weird"" people around. i know some incoming freshmen tend to blend in no matter what, to get them socially engaged. socializing is really fun, but sometimes it can be devastating if we used inappropriate manners. if you made a bunch of friends and found yourself unpleasant, steer clear. found something that fits your interest, go for it. in college campuses, the quality of your friends could influence your future development. a high-quality friend circle will help you building solid network beyond college, even for the entire life. ",student life

"my advice for incoming freshmen attending uw (part 2) again, those are just my personal perspectives, not accurately reflect everyone's situation,

&#x200b;

# 7. stay conscious all the time when off-campus

many public universities such as the university of washington (seattle), university of minnesota (twin cities), and new york university, have its campus in urban settings, which means the campus is no difference from a city neighborhood. there's no fences around (columbia university in nyc is an exception), so you're responsible for protecting yourself. regardless when you're walking on the ave (university way), put away your cellphone and headphone and refrain yourself from carrying large amounts of cash (anything exceeds $200). also, for those who have chemistry or physics lab sections ending past 8:30pm or want late-night social life, i recommend not to wear some luxurious or attractive outfits. don't make yourself being a target, it's not good.

​

# 8. buy a cheap bike with an expensive lock (even multiple)

getting your bike stolen creates unnecessary burden to your life, but bike thefts are preventable. i reviewed all the incidents reported to uwpd from september 2020 to july 2021, most of the bike thefts were happened in west campus dorm and its surrounding, parking lots, life science building, light rail station, and the medicine building. those places are either have beautiful scene or always crowded. the best way is to buy a cheap bike (from walmart, or less than $500) with a few expensive locks (one u-lock and one combination lock). and never set password as something like 1-1-1-1 or 1-2-3-4, those passwords not help. lastly, put your bike with others, or take a picture if possible. once you noticed something suspicious, report to uwpd immediately. one of my friends in minneapolis suffered from bike lost this summer multiple times, so i want give a warning on those who want to get expensive ones.

​

# 9. some good professors may not be help for your grades

the stem weedouts at uw have horror stories, and most of it comes from phys 12x and math 12x sequences. and lots of my friends were seeking professor andrew loveless' class (math 126 this past year) after seeing some comments on ratemyprofessor. however, if you're not smart as those applying for cs or acms, rusty test-taking strategies, or want stellar grades, then a good professor may not help you. first, good professors making the concepts digestible so most of the class can easily understand. second, grades are curved, so if you made some silly mistakes (like 1+1=3), your grade will be lower than you expected. lastly, great professor usually has brutal curve, especially in math 12x. terrible professors have hard exam but more rooms for making mistakes. my math 124 professor yu yuan was terrible at lecturing but i ended up with a decent grade.

​

# 10. never staying up late when you have exam in the upcoming day

before the midterm or the final exam, we're all stressed because we want to do well. however, if you desire the best performance on the exam, then please do not be the ""all nighter"" beforehand, even your exam is not in the morning (before 10:30am). cramming exams will only increase your anxiety rather than calming down. when i know my midterm is coming, i start learning and reviewing about 5–10 days ahead and on the day before the exam, i sleep at latest 12am. you don't like the drowsy feeling when taking the exam, do you? college is already stressful enough, adding extra stress will adversely affect your exam performance and mental health. in general, regardless of when your exam starts, never stay up late and begging for retake afterward.",advice

"advice to my younger freshman self... ...from future you, who's been on campus for less than 2 quarters

1. please read up what panic attacks and anxiety looks like. cause when you took only half an edible and freaked out, you could've saved money by not going to the hospital. general rule of thumb, don't do anything new drug wise by yourself 

2. i don't care how cute it was when your first date with that junior was watching atla, trust him when he says he doesn't want a relationship. you're only hurting by staying and he is definitely not changing for you lol

3. make multiple friend groups. not just that group of people on your floor who gush about superbad. because trust me if (actually when) that group falls apart you're going to feel like the whole world is ending. make friends everywhere and you're going to be just fine

4. that best friend 3,000 miles away from you? not worth staying in your room convincing her to video call when friends at your door are holding snacks and ice cream because they wanted to support you during that friend breakup. sometimes you outgrow people from your past and that's ok. it just means you're getting closer to being the person you're meant to be 

5. don't walk alone at night on the ave and greek row. if that boy cared about you, he would've cared about your safety

6. flick the bean in the morning. don't care how horny you are because 2 seconds away from finishing you're going to accidently make eye contact with your roommate who also thought you were sleeping...

7. 4am at ode with friends and strangers is going to make you happier than that one frat party 

8. stop taking school so serious and get out of your room. trust yourself that the after class revision was enough 

9. water and center table's scrambled eggs the next morning. your keys are in the fridge btw

10. ice in that drink! don't grind on the guy dressed up as harry potter! go with three friends if you anticipate going home with some other girl!

10. actually no take your studies seriously. after that first midterm, midterm season doesn't stop until 2 weeks before the end of quarter. get back on that smh

11. just know no matter what you did your best. you aren't perfect and no one is. even that girl who seems to have everything (4.0 in cse, a bf, perfect outfits, perfect body, etc.) focus on doing your best.

12. stop taking everything so goddamn personal. you aren't the moon kissing the night sky. you have to sing under the sea with all your heart. you have to shovel cheerios 2 mins before your 8:30 because you know you aren't going to function later. you have to pause for a minute and just admire those corgis. you have to stop spending hours after a test figuring out your grade and then your back up major. you've got to stop trying to make your neighbors like you. fuck it kid. you've got to love yourself.

13. i'm proud of you even if mom doesn't tell you. your value doesnt go down when she yells at you for not carrying your tracker (sorry i mean cellular device) everywhere. you aren't a whore

14. that guy from madrona? that girl from calc? those people you randomly met? i can't wait for you to get to know them because you're going to find so much love. open your heart to then and watch how you heal in a healthy environment. you deserve this

15. be boundless even if the campaign ends next year",advice

but that wasn't the end of my crazy night. immediately after the scene and the actors cleared up, another guy entered the shop through the open window, moved a chair around to the garbage disposal at the center of the restaurant, dug though the trash and started drinking something he found in there. he ambled around for a few minutes, picked up and pocketed what seemed like a knife to me and tried to sneak away with takeout boxes. he was stopped by one of the restaurant workers on his way out and gave up though.

i had to wait a good five to ten minutes for my order to be complete and then left for home. on my way out who do i see? the same actors still roaming about on the ave. with a lot of new students coming in, this is just a reminder to stay safe, avoid sketchy areas, not venture out too late alone or to move in groups at such times. be boundless guys!!",student life

and because of the cold and the rain recently, eating outside isn't an option and eating inside my classes is no longer an option bc of covid 🙃

as an individual who has struggled with an eating disorder for the past 2 years, this is causing me immense stress. i already have such a hard time eating but now i can't even find a place to spend literally 30 minutes to sit and eat 🥲 and i can't eat inside my classes because of covid which already is hard for me as i am forced to not be able to eat during my long lectures and now with my one hour in between i still can't eat 🥲🥲🥲

"no outside cups in dining halls i'm a bit confused about the reasoning behind hfs staff saying that they don't want people to bring outside containers to fill with (free) drinks. the reason i heard was that ""we don't know where that bottle has been, and you're touching things"".  
that doesn't make sense to me, because the main point of physical contact between my things and the cafeteria things is my hand, not my bottle/cup. i also don't like wasting materials, even though (as the staff pointed out), they're compostable. compostable containers still take resources to make, transport, and actually compost, and i don't see the need to use more than necessary in this case.

"screwed up schedule hi y'all,

i'm suppose to graduate this spring and i only have 5 class left to take, not including this quarter.   
my problem is, i was planning on taking these two classes at the same time next quarter (class a and class b). but, i just learned that class a is actually a prereq for class b.   


i'm currently freaking out because i was not aware of this, nor did my advisors let me know despite me going to them for academic help. i do not want to wait a whole year to graduate just to take one class. if i were to take class a next quarter and then class b, i'll end up being a whole quarter behind because class b is a series class that requires me to take one more class after it (class c).   


i already emailed my advisors about this situation but do yall think i'll be able to still take both classes at the same time? class b has three class prereqs that i needed to take, two of which i already took and did above a 3.0 on. class a is the third class in a series and which i did very well on in the first two quarters.",academics

"it's that time again; guys if you're going to approach a girl in public, here's how to do it we're back on campus and haven't talked to people on campus in over a year. it's weird and we're all socially (and probably touch) deprived. if you want to make friends or find a potential partner, chances are you've considered the cold-approach of just walking up to a cute stranger and asking them out.

for reasons you may never fully understand, this can be scary for women. always has been, always will. as a woman who's had this happen a not-insignificant number of times, it really depends on the situation. sometimes it's straight-up predatory, and even if you aren't a creep, we still have to be prepared for that. we get that some people are really trying to be nice, but it's awkward because of the timing/location/lack of social skills so here's some advice:

the best of intentions can still make moments like this plenty upsetting! pick your time/place carefully-- if she's near the front of a 30 min line at the suzzalo starbucks, she's not going to be able to leave if she feels uncomfortable. also 9am is a little early to get hit on, at least let her finish her coffee.

don't open with a comment on physical appearance (unless it's to compliment a specific piece of clothing or pin or something you have in common). we already know that's what got your attention. you can work in a compliment whilst flirting, but don't start there-- there are plenty of things more interesting about her than her physical appearance, and she'll be very impressed if you manage to convey that in the first 20 seconds. instead, start with a greeting that gives her a chance to answer how she's doing and importantly, if this is a good time to talk (you're not more important than cramming for a midterm, so if that's what's happening at the library then don't drag it out). if you get a conversation going, offer small bits of information like what/where your housing is or what your year/major is-- just things that turn you into a real person in her head instead of a random stranger from who-knows-where). keep this convo brief-- even if she seems interested, a) she's probably also still in the middle of something, and b) you don't want to play your whole hand at once-- leave her wondering more about you. the more you talk the more likely it is she'll hear something that kills her interest. if your goal is a date, wait til then before you start diving into how compatible you might be.

now for your exit strategy-- this is the most important part. even if it's going well, if it's not a good time or she seems uncomfortable here's what you should say/do: ""anyways, i'm \[insert name here\], i should probably get going but i'd really like to get to know you better. can i give you my number/snapchat?"" (if you managed to find a common hobby, invite her to participate in said hobby with you). and then here's the kicker- do not give her your phone or ask for hers. give your number/snap to her on a piece of paper, old-fashioned style (but write it out in front of her so it doesn't look like you've been handing out business cards to every other girl). you don't really have to wait for an answer, just hand it to her/leave it on the table, and make a swift exit (throw in a ""have a nice day"" or even a ""talk to you later!"" if you're feeling bold).

it may catch her off guard, but in a good way-- it'll make you stand out and seem classier, more like the male lead of her fave 2000s rom com and less like someone who just hits on girls as a hobby and collects numbers like pokemon cards. this also gives her the chance to decide if she's interested without the fear of someone she doesn't know having her contact information, or having someone hover over her to make that decision on the spot. less of a chance of a knee-jerk ""no"" reaction. if she's interested, she'll reach out. if not, drop it. you don't want to chase after someone who isn't interested in you anyways.

a few final notes on flirting/the conversation itself:  
\- confidence is by far the most important thing-- if you seem nervous, she's gonna think you're swinging out of your league and she shouldn't settle (related-- don't swing out of your league; aka don't pick the hottest person you see, pick someone who might pick you too)

\- smile and try to get her to smile; you don't have to be funny but be nice

\- plan what you're going to ask her before you approach, but don't try to memorize a script-- find something specific about her to ask about, it's much easier for her to talk about herself than follow a random topic of conversation

\- again, keep it brief. the longer you interrupt her day, the greater the chance of annoying her to saying no for reasons unrelated to your charms

finally, this is not the ideal way to meet someone-- you should really use this as a last resort if you don't have any opportunities to meet people in your classes or at a club meeting or through friends

y'all are gonna shoot your shot anyways though so hopefully this'll save everyone involved from a very awkward encounter. good luck gents",advice

i've been pretty hesitant to upload anything regarding to friendship thread on this subreddit because it's usually used for academic specific, or just people trying to gather for specific purpose. but seeing and knowing that everyone is also seeking for some sort of connection here made me relieved and know that i'm not alone here.

"thoughts on tonights early election 2021 results so far? im sure some of us are aware of seattle’s election results so far, if not here’s a link

looks like moderate liberals rejected the progressive leftist, and our city’s voters are sending a mandate for change centered around safety and action. 

personally i’m in the center, and i don’t trust the progressives, so i’m content with the results but i want to see all the candidates in action before declaring victory.

"ultimate guide to uw seattle campus (registration, buildings) as the registration for winter 2022 begins, you will take another batch of classes at different locations. however, college campus is huge compared to high school campus. here's my ultimate guide on how to not get lost on uw campus. i divide the uw seattle campus into six regions: up north, montlake east, red square, fountain, waterfront southwest, and far south.  


**the up north region (6)**

* ***buildings***: *parrington hall (par), denny hall (den), paccar hall (pcar), dempsey hall (dem), hutchinson hall (hut), and bank of america executive education center (exed)*.
* ***tips***: buildings at the up north region are typically on the top of the hill, which you need to walk or run uphill from anywhere on the campus. except for parrington hall, all the buildings are next to each other. i recommend you walk fast, not run, when going uphill so you can save more energy before class starts.

**the montlake east region (8)**

* ***buildings***: *loew hall (low), mechanical engineering building (meb), mueller hall (mue), more hall (mor), bill & melinda gates cse center (cse2), thomson hall (tho), clark hall (clk), and communications building (cmu)*.
* ***tips***: mostly downhill, except for the segment of east stevens way from mueller hall to loew hall. those building are the closest to the ima fields and building but far away from the ave. some recitation sections or seminar-style classes are held at either loew hall, mechanical engineering building, or thomson hall. if you do not want to walk uphill, then take bus route 372 or 75 and get off by padelford hall. not recommend using the burke-gilman trail, you will climb lots of stairs (unless you like it).

**the red square region (9)**

* ***buildings***: *kane hall (kne), savery hall (sav), gowen hall (gwn), smith hall (smi), miller hall (mlr), raitt hall (rai), music building (mus), art building (art), and meany hall (mny)*.
* ***tips***: since these buildings are clustered around the red square, so there will be lots of people walking around from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. when walking at the red square region, please walk gently while speedy, and don't push or mess up the crowds. bricks at the red square can be slippery at times, be cautious. also, from kane hall to art building is a hill.

**the fountain region (10)**

* ***buildings***: *mary gates hall (mgh), sieg hall (sig), johnson hall (jhn), bagley hall (bag), guggenheim hall (gug), electrical and computer engineering building (ece), chemistry library building (chl), nano science building (nan), atmospheric science-geophysics building (atg), benson hall (bns) and chemistry building (chb).* 
* ***tips***: hill climbings at johnson-mary gates hall walkway and rainier vista. if you're going from ece building to miller hall, you need to speed walk. walking fast at an uphill slope is easier than downhill. mary gates hall has multiple exits on the first floor. walking towards the hub-sieg area and making turns to avoid the crowds. for those classes at either bns, chl, atg, or bag, take the west stevens way to the red square or west campus dorms and buildings.

**the waterfront southwest region (11)**

* ***buildings***: *marine studies building (mar), fishery science building (fsh), fisheries teaching building (ftr),  hitchcock hall (hck), physics/astronomy auditorium (paa), physics/astronomy building (pab), kincaid hall (kin), condon hall (cdh), gould hall (gld), architecture hall (arc), and social work building (sws)*.
* ***tips***: they're far away, and i do not recommend having another class at those buildings back-to-back (paa and pab are not terrible in term of the distance). if you have to take it here, then you could either speed walk, jog, or come late to the class (not recommended), especially for the fishery science building. hitchcock hall is located next to life science building and kincaid hall, the second overpass bridge from the west. for condon hall, take the 41st street to avoid traffic lights. for gould hall, jaywalk campus parkway and take the overpass. 

**the far south region (6)**

* ***buildings***: *bloedel hall (bld), anderson hall (and), wickenwerder forest lab (wfs), health science tower (hst), health science building (hsb), and roberts hall (rob)*.
* ***tips***: far away. walk fast or jog.",student life

do you guys feel like you're here because you want to be, or because you're obligated to be?

i'm just curious if anyone else is feeling just... dissatisfied, really. like this is really pointless or not doing anything for you. why is that? what are your solutions and thoughts? transfer to another school, transfer out of school into a trade or apprenticeship, just taking a couple years off to work and find yourself... whaddaya think? and if you used to feel that way but have found inspiration, what is it that drives you to succeed here?",advice

i’ve been playing for 10ish years now (though the first few years weren’t that productive, to be sure) and gming for 3 now!

"in-person exams/covid - what to do? hey, i’m looking for advice on what to do in this situation. i’m currently in a large lecture class (400ish students) that is conducted in person with panopto as an option for lecture content.

since the beginning of the year, we have had a handful of covid cases in the class, which have been ramping up lately. after the first of these i decided it wasn’t worth the stress to attend in person and stopped going. 

however, we also have in-person exams which you are required to attend. the professor doesn’t offer make up exams (one exam is dropped from the final grade) so there is a lot of pressure to go even if you are sick. lots of people coughing, sneezing, etc, in a lecture hall where there isn’t space to socially distance.

this is mildly frustrating normally but you can kind of work with it, just lay low for a few days after the exam and get a covid test. however the next exam is the day before thanksgiving. many students are concerned about contracting covid during the exam and then exposing their families when they go home. is there anything we can do other than just take the l and not show up to the exam?",advice

i am a sophomore right now. since i got into uw, i had been craving for getting into foster school of business. my average prerequisite gpas are pretty low, like something around 3.4-3.6. though i got into my intended major (economics) this quarter, i felt myself failing compared with friends who got into foster.
 

i have a high self-esteem, and i never feel myself achieved something. foster is definitely one of the majors which hold tons of resources, and i do not want to give up even there is a slim chance. it has been a month that i have been struggling with my inner self on the topic of applying foster.
 

it is likely i would fail my foster application next spring since i even don’t have high prereq gpa. i cannot sleep, eat, and even speak well nowadays, and i am making myself stressed out. i do not have enthusiasm anymore, and i just want to stay at my room all the time. every night i had crisis of studying when i go to bed, and i woke up at 3 with same crisis.
 

i am kinda desperate right now. some friends have comforted me multiple times on the major topic, but i just cannot let it go easily. how should i tell myself to calm down and go with it? please…

\-should i take time to complete an associate's degree over doing high-level math and physics courses?

\*

\*

after lots of research, i have found that if you want to be a uw cs major as a running start student it is most important that you get the cs major [prerequisites](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/currentuw) finished ([with nearly perfect grades](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/transfer)) so you can enroll for direct admission into the cs major as a freshman because as of 2019 the cs major became a [predominantly direct admission major](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm). you should only go for an associate's degree if you have enough leftover classes after finishing the prerequisites for the cs major with high grades. an associate's degree is good for your resume and working before you get your bachelor's. i don't think most people will work at more than minimum wage jobs until after completing their major anyways, making the associate's degree seem nearly pointless for uw cs majors. after completing the prerequisites it is important to get as many [cs major graduation requirements](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/ugrad/curriculum/cs_reqs_wi22.pdf) as your community college offers as possible to finish the required courses at an easier and cheaper college.

"a tool to authenticate your class discord! i've just graduated a few weeks ago. however i created an open sourced tool during my independent study for a professor's class discord.

as uw starts the first week via online, i believe that this may be helpful for students who are creating their online class discord communities. this tool authenticates students using their uwnetid. upon authenticating, they will be given a predefined role in the class discord. the role may be used to grant additional access to the server. this is so that that only students and/or other uw affiliated people with a uwnetid may access their class discords. there is an optional logging mechanic which may also be used so that the one who created the server may know which student is whom in the server for additional security.

i know people work super hard and get rejected so i am sure it is pretty hopeless but thought i might ask for a second opinion if i choose to reapply:

* gpa: my gpa was tanked with covid and especially phys 12x and family situations - it was absolutely brutal. my gpa is a 3.1 at the moment. >\_<
* cs courses: 
   * i have taken cse 142, 143 (while the grades aren't super high, they are higher than all my other grades by far except vlpa, div, w)
   * cse 190: lab that went with cse 142 and helped with fundamentals
   * cse 390h: i was one of 18 students to take an honors cs course with professor reges where he talked about how cs people approach problems, common issues, etc.
   * cse 331: i was lucky and secured a spot today in this course (i really wanted it and worked super hard to get into it with my petition, emails, etc)
   * cse 373: also taking this course this quarter with kevin lin - so far, i really enjoy the content.
* research
   * i am currently a member in a research lab of 100+ people and have quickly became a high ranking technical writer with grant proposals being funded for the lab.
   * i am also the finalist in two competitions for a project i'm working on (i am working with 1 other but i am definitely pulling my own weight for the competitions). it is quick possible this project is becoming a startup within the next month, in which case i will be a startup leader? that's wild.
* extracurriculars
   * i am currently the director of a hackathon that is later this year and leading committees, securing sponsors, obtained mlh status, etc. i have spearheaded this.
   * i am an ece ta where i work with assignments, exams, course materials, etc.
   * i have continuously worked since sophomore year in high school and have worked at a grocery store since the start of covid for 20hrs a week
* internship
   * i am desperately trying to get one and just got the book cracking the coding interview to assist with interviews
* family
   * i have a disabled sibling that i also help my family care for 3 days a week. :)
* high school stuff
   * fbla president and 4 statewide awards and national finalist
   * asb treasurer, link crew, nhs, tri-m honor society
   * 3.7 gpa and then 4.42 gpa weighted
   * 12 ap courses with scholarship with distinction twice, even during covid senior year
   * orchestra
   * a killer personal statement

i have very strong writing skills so i am sure my personal statement would be as good as possible - but i do not feel my application is enough (will it ever be?) i only discovered my passion for cs when i got to uw and i am so annoyed - i feel i was a stronger applicant back before covid, when i applied to uw (but regrets dont help)

i have some concerns tho:
-i have to look up a lot of words, and i am worried i will not be able to understand test instructions.
-this has been way more stressful, and normally is a class i enjoy.
-cannot understand others or the profess, and whats going on in class.

"has anyone ever been “reported” to the communications chair? what usually comes of that? a summary of what happened that lead to it:

every week we have about 3 readings and 4 assignments every week. this week, in addition to those assignments and readings we also had a paper due. two days before the paper was due i sent him an email and asked him about if in next class we could have a group discussion and see about possibly not having to do one of those assignments only the next week that we have a paper due, since this week was a bit overwhelming and i was wondering if it was the same for other students or if it was just me. (the initial email i sent him was super chill, and reading it you could tell it was just a student who was stressed out).

when he responded, his first sentence was “i’m not sure what you’re trying to convey in this email but,” then listed out 1-5 (like a literal list) how this is the collage life and i need to get used to it, i should have said something when the assignment was given, i’ve had the syllabus so i should have planned ahead, etc. etc. and i’m summing it up so more went into it, but the way he worded things, he was clearly talking down to me and i felt like i was being belittled.
so i replied (angerly, i’ll admit) about how i didn’t see why he needed to talk down to me, i was just asking about a possibility, and i have other classes with other assignments and i simply wasn’t able to plan how overwhelmed i’d be, i thought i could handle it. i have only a quarter left in my senior year you know?

bottom line, he didn’t like my response and said his “writing style and how he choose to convey things is his choice” and he will not let me talk about this situation next class (i said i wanted to get other students feelings about the assignments) and that he reported me to “the chair of communication and academic advisor”

so i’m just wondering.. does anyone know what’ll happen?

edit: i also want to add after he told me he reported me, he said “good luck on your paper” and i’m kind of worried to submit things to him now and that this issue is going to affect my grade. so i haven’t turned it in yet (he actually extended the due date to tonight because 2 other students asked)",advice
"abt the crime in the area i’m originally from a city with high rates of murders and whatnot. talking like once i was walking down the street, there were firefighters taking down an arson fire in one building and cops dealing with a hostage situation in the building next door. i’ve been shot at a couple times too. so i think i have good advice. 

so, here’s my advice to avoid these crimes happening in the area. 

if you go anywhere, go with three or more people. don’t go out alone after sunset. 

because the weapon being used is a taser, you can run. don’t even try to fight, throw your valuable items onto the ground and just run. 

a lot of people believe these are human traffickers. most traffickers just lure young people in and manipulate them over a long period of time. these are robbers, they don’t want your body, they want your stuff. 

if these people talk to you, speak in a slow clear voice and say exactly what you’re going to do in every motion, “i am going to hand you my cell phone/keys/whatever.” you absolutely do not want them to think you are a threat, as they will just attack you. 

if you are restrained or fear they are going to move you to a second location, then you start freaking out. scream, flail, act wildly. be so inconvenient that they don’t want to mess with you. attract so much attention, they have to drop you.

last resort if you think someone is following you, start filming and confront them and tell them to stop following you. this is really a last resort. if there’s no one around to help you and you feel you can’t outrun them, this is your final call. 

if they don’t stop following you, act like a crazy, mentally insane person. like foaming, gurgling, off the rocker insanity. they will not want to be anywhere near you. 

this is my advice, i hope you guys find it helpful!",advice

"prospective uw grad student from nyc: seattle social dynamics hi! i'm considering moving to seattle since i've been accepted into a ph.d. program at the university of washington. of course, i plan to visit the city myself since i have never been, however, i'm getting a lot of polarizing opinions about the city. i currently live in manhattan nyc and have lived here for 6 years. i attended university in nyc and currently work in the city. fun facts: i'm 25 y/o, a black person, single and i'll be studying within the stem field. i'm mostly interested in the social dynamics of the city; i keep hearing about the ""seattle freeze"" and considering i don't know anyone and would be building up a friend group from scratch, that's a big concern. although, i think the graduate component will help. i have a good amount of confidence in my academic program, however, i'm more worried about the social dynamics since that appears to be a point of contention for many transplants. grad school in my case is a 4-6 year commitment and i want to ensure i make an informed decision before uprooting. can people share what the young mid-twenties people are like here? what do people tend to do for fun? what's the dating scene like for straight women? what would be a better neighborhood to live in proximity to the university? any you're willing to share at this point would be appreciated",student life
"therapy resources for students i’ve been falling into neative feedback loops over things i can no longer control. i feel horrendously socially stunted. i had a pretty good childhood, but i feel like my parents made certain choices that artificially limited my growth. i’ve missed out on so many milestones most people have in high school, and a lot of social milestones i met in high school are things that most people meet in elementary school. i’m really unhappy with the path i took into college. i feel like i could have had choices in what i studied and where i went, but had to settle with the one decent school that would take me, and the only open major that interested me, because i squandered my ability to get into closed majors in running start. as a mixture of covid, i feel like i missed out entirely on the first stage of adulthood. i thought i’d prefer living at home, but i feel like not dorming has put me even further behind my peers who are at least starting to live independently. i realize it’s meaningless in the grand scheme of life, but i really wish i gave myself a traditional freshman experience to make up for all the traditional milestones i didn’t meet in k-12. i don’t really want to dorm next year because i’d feel weird about doing it as a 21 year old. i know many people had shitty dorm experiences, but most of my friends are having a lot of fun with that traditional experience, and it makes me feel left out sometimes.

i keep falling into negative feedback loops like this one. they are triggered by the most mundane of things and when they are triggered i have no way to consciously control them. i only stop spiraling through equally mundane things, like  the sunlight looking particularly nice, or having a good time with a friend.  i’m tired of pitying myself, trauma dumping on friends, and ranting on reddit. i want to see a therapist. i don’t want to on my parents insurance because a lot of the things i’ve been falling into negative feedback loops over were in part their choices, and i don‘t want to upset them. this isn’t like when i was suicidally depressed in high school where i could chock it entirely as me wanting to deal with chemical imbalance. i also am considering a career as a commercial pilot, and any mental health diagnosis has the potential to be disqualifying. are there any confidential resources i can see that are either cheap or free? i have a couple thousand dollars saved but i have no idea how many sessions that gets me",student life

"whip man origin story once, there was a man who lived in the washington countryside. he worked on a farm, and overall had a great life. his favorite hobby was cracking whips, especially in the dead of night, to see if he could still hit his targets with barely a sliver of moonlight.

however, one day he was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease which would leave both his arms paralyzed, preventing him from ever cracking a whip again. heartbroken, he resolved to perfect his craft, before finally succumbing to his fate.

but late one evening he received a knock on his door, and a shadowy figure with a husky by his side spoke to him. ""we know what ails you. we have heard of cases like yours, and we may be able to help you. there is a... machine, at our university. an experimental machine. it transfers part of the wellbeing of an organ into another, at the expense of the health of the source. we have helped people before, though never cases as severe as yours. as this machine is not yet approved, we would appreciate it if you spoke of this to no one. but know that we may be able to help you.""

the man, of course, agreed. he would willingly trade almost anything for the ability to crack whips for the rest of his life, it being his greatest passion. and so he moved onto the university of washington campus temporarily to receive his treatment. it never bothered him that the source organ of the machine's health transfer was not noted.

over the next weeks, this man felt his arms growing stronger, too strong, he thought that the machine must have completed its treatment, but he believed he could aquire muscles superior to those before by continuing treatment, so he chose to deceive the scientists operating the experimental machine, and told them his muscles were deteriorating further.

this continued for several months, and the man slowly felt his senses fade, he believed it was simply the contrast relative to the newfound strength of his arms. then his consciousness began to slip. then his understanding of who he was. for what the scientists had neglected to mention was that the only organ powerful enough to draw energy from was the brain.

after three missed treatments, the scientists checked on the man's residence late at night to find the inside of the apartment smashed and slashed beyond recognition. one of the windows had been thrown open, and another had been pulverized. horrified, the scientists checked to see outside the window. they were never heard of again, and the machine they had created was eventually lost to time.

it's said his spirit still haunts the ave, and that at night you can hear a soft whip occasionally cracking, intermingling with the tinkling of the rusted doorbells.",discussion

"bruh y’all are rich (y’all as a generalization) 

i thought people weren’t serious when they said most students at uw could afford to live on campus. so far, almost every person i’ve met lives on campus. 

anyway, i did cashiering today at noodle, as opposed to my usual prep job, and i was shocked. 

almost every single student had $800+ dollars on their husky card. 

like, i’m assuming it’s not the exact same exchange rate as usd, it’s just husky money, but damn! the rich people at this school can afford to have anything they want, whenever! 

i’m not saying it’s bad to be rich, i’m just shocked by how different uw is from cc. like, most students don’t work and go to school. most students live on campus. most have 100s of dollars a quarter for high quality food. 

uw is a culture shock for me, in terms of wealth. anyone else relate to this?

edit:

i do know many people take out loans to live here, i was just noting how many people i have met that have been so casually wealthy that they don’t seem to process it. this post is not about scholarship loan students.  

for example, several people in my class told me how their parents pay for their entire tuition and everything else for them. again, not bad, but i just felt so surprised by how common that is here. it’s interesting to me.

double edit: 

once again, i’m directly referring to the casually wealthy students i see. the canada goose jackets, the patagonia coats, the lv wallets.

"uw ms in data science (msds): a review i have not found many places to review the uw masters in data science program on the internet, so figured it might belong here. note: msds during covid may not be what it once was or what it might be in the future.

if you majored in cse at the uw and expect the same level of quality in your masters do not apply to msds. the program has largely **not** met expectations and many of my peers feel the same way. 

teaching: boring, slow, with (sometimes) less qualified professors.  
expecting this program to be connected to cse uw i imagined some overlap between the cse professors and data classes, this was not the case. i understand that uw cse has its own masters, however many professors dont even come from uw itself, with the ones that do coming from the stats and biostats departments. many of the lectures i experienced were 4 hour slogs in which the msds discord was alight with people joking to pass the time and planning where they were going to get dinner. some even expressed that they teach themselves most topics through khan academy...   
for a major which is part stats and part computer science this program does not bring enough computer science faculty onboard, considering it is attached to the uw name.

community: vibrant, fun, interesting  
on the upside, msds has amazing cohorts, people are excited to join and network but also plan fun nights out. something that surprised me when i joined was that there were only around 5 people actually from uw in the program, with many coming from overseas or out of state. generally nothing bad to say about the students, all of them are bright and passionate.

i dont want to spend time slandering uw msds or its faculty, i wish this review only to point out the discrepancy between uw's amazing cse department and what i feel to be an underdeveloped data science program. uw msds attaches itself heavily to the uw name but the courses dont have any uw cse professors or use the same cse buildings for lectures, in reality the only connected cse event we have are the recruiting fairs, which have largely been decimated by covid. 

i hope this review becomes useless when uw decides to invest in its msds program more but i want masters students to know what they are paying for when deciding to give up 35k in tuition.

feel free to ask away in the replies and i will answer what i can.",academics

"apartments with dorm like experience i commuted and i really wish i worked more before uw to pay to live on campus my first year. i barely see my friends, and i missed out on so many of the social opportunities my friends have. i don't really feel like i am part of the university community either, mostly because i'm not even though i am on campus 8:30am-8:30pm most days. i'll be 21 next year, so i probably wouldn't fit in with dorm residents since y'all will all be 18-19. also dorm rooms are tiny for what you pay for.

are there any apartments nearby that are kind of like dorms in the way that you interact with a large amount of people living near you? realistically if i get an off campus apartment i am going to be as lonely as i am now, just lonely in the u district instead of edmonds. i've tried attending clubs but the clubs meet too infrequently to realistically lead to friendships, or are online. most people at clubs already seem to have social bubbles they don't want to break out of, and tbh at that point i don't see the point of going. making friends in classes is pretty hit or miss. i don't really get invited to anything except one on one dinner/lunch every so often which isn't really enough social stimulation for me.

"i’m tired of failing but if i don’t fix this i’m throwing in the towel on life transfer student/junior/history department 

i don’t know where to start with any of this other than to say i feel hollow and like a sham.

i know i’m better than all of this but i just don’t know how i got here. i used to be so passionate and energetic. i was a mediocre high school student but really took off in speech & debate. i received good grades at my first college and did decent through the first part of the pandemic but everything changed after i left campus and then left my parent’s house to live on my own.

i lived with sociopaths, meth-heads and dying old people. i’ve slept in a nook in the wall, i’ve slept in the cold, i’ve gone to sleep hungry.

i’ve dealt with both bipolar and adhd throughout my life and while i’m now medicated, and living in a safe environment with some close friends i still can’t fucking make it work.

through most of all of this i’ve been working at a grocery store and i think it’s eating away at my soul. the crazy people, the anti-vax/anti-mask crowd, snooty and condescending upper class white people, the incompetent management and the physically-intensive labor have all been draining on me. 

but i need to pay rent and eat food (financial aid luckily covers my tuition). and those are getting more and more expensive over time it seems.

my transcript since last winter has been abysmal. a couple xs, one ns, and one whole quarter just absolutely failed (last quarter). i’ve been able to discuss a lot of my struggles and get some leeway and really appreciated assistance from advisors and counselors to be able to continue this quarter. but i just can’t seem to find the energy or patience or even mental well-being to study anymore it seems. i just lay in bed a lot of the time or just sleep because i’m so tired and depressed and i feel almost removed from my surroundings and like there’s thick barrier between me and the world right in front of me. i cry, i sleep, i stare into nothingness. it’s so tragic because i’m such a curious and fairly learned person in the subjects i study and have a yearning to go on to more, complete research and finish well but why can’t i seem to actually do any of it? it’s like i keep getting back on the horse only to fall right off.

i resent all of this because i continue to doubt myself and feel like i’m not actually equipped or intelligent enough to be here. 

i feel like an absolute failure and i think i want to just give up. not just school but i mean everything.

i write this with the second exam due for a class tomorrow when i haven’t even done the first or attended a lecture since the first day and it seems like the professor has a strict exam policy and allows no make-ups without medical or university excuse. i’m already on academic probation from my previous quarters.

i’m tired of failing and i know i’m better than this but i don’t know what to do.

i feel like my entire life is on the brink of falling apart and i just might throw myself into the lake. i’ll never reach my goals and all of this feels like a lofty escapade i was never cut out for because i’m lazy and stupid and sad.

"re: the recent influx of “can you hold x class for me?” posts you can only sign up for, at max, 19 credits until the first day of the quarter. unless you want one, singular 4-credit or less class, no one can hold it for you (assuming they’re seeking 15 credits; if they’re seeking 12, hey, you might have a shot). however, you’d be better off just asking a close friend than looking here. additionally, you’re not always going to get the class you want - but that doesn’t mean you won’t get the ones you *need* on time. when you’re a senior you can apply for graduation up to three quarters  prior to your commencement date which gives you first priority. priority rocks - i’ve always gotten the classes i wanted. if you’re very dead set on a class, sign up for notify uw. if you’re fast enough, you’re likely to get it, even if you have to try multiple times and/or wait until the first week begins. plus, some of the classes that you guys have been asking for are major-only up until a certain date or indefinitely. if you aren’t in the major, your chances are mid-to-low of ever getting into it. if you’re in the major, you’ll get it eventually.

now i’m finding out that i’ll only need to take 10 credits my last quarter as far as my current major requirements go, but because 10 and 15 credits cost the same amount, i was thinking of taking one extra class. something fun, something easy. something that genuinely interests me. i was thinking an art or language class. maybe even latin. 

yesterday i also found out…i only need 5 more credits to graduate with the regular political science major on top of my other two majors lmao. my mom and everyone i know is saying i should just take the last class. get a triple major because it’s one more thing on my resume and i’ve already tortured myself to this point. it’s just 5 more credits. i was just looking forward to leaving political science behind.

"aspiring uw student hello all,

i am a senior in washington state, and i have applied to uw.

i was about a 3.8 student pre-covid, but then i tanked to a 3.3 after covid. it’s my senior year in high school, so it’s practically impossible to raise my gpa. my sat is nowhere near where i want it to be since my school literally didn’t prep any of the students. when i applied to uw, my grade 11 marks were oh-so poor, and i can’t help but regret ever succumbing to my anxieties and depression. mental health issues are nothing new to me and they’ve never interfered with my grades, but covid really tested me. 

now, i feel like my grades have replaced my face when it comes to college applications because it seems to be grades first, and then me. there are a handful of colleges who would reach out and give me a chance of redemption when it comes to grades, but unfortunately those chances are unlikely. 

is it possible to still make a good candidate for uw, or just any college in general? 

my essays for uw have potential to makeup for the poor grades as i talked about my diverse background, mental health, and school during the pandemic. maybe that will be sufficient, but i’ll never know …!

tldr: covid tanked my grades from 3.8 to 3.3, and my only hope is that my essays are sufficient for admissions. is it possible that i’m still a good candidate for uw, let alone other colleges?

if anyone would like to chat with me about this, please let me know ! i’m willing to talk with people on this subreddit as i’ve done some browsing recently !

thank u for reading !",advice

"as we approach uw’s decision day… i know a ton of people on here are lurking hs seniors so i just wanted to leave this message here.

regardless of whether you get in or not, realize that a college decision does not define you in any way. you are just as smart and capable regardless of whether or not you get accepted to your dream school. 

i was in your position two years ago and i understand how stressful this time can be with the anticipation of whether or not you’ll get in mixed with potential disappointment and excitement too. it’s so many emotions at once that it can be overwhelming sometimes. take time to yourself so that you take care of your mental health. also make sure you celebrate your wins too even if you’re disappointed by some of the decisions you get. after all, making it this far is a pretty big deal and you deserve to feel proud of yourself for all of the hard work you put in.

please don’t let a less than ideal decision take away from your self worth or peace of mind. you’ll end up where you’re meant to be and you’ll get a great education regardless of where you end up going. honestly, beating yourself up about a decision just isn’t worth the time and emotional turmoil. trust me, i’m speaking from experience.

so yeah, all in all just relax this upcoming month or so and trust that things will work out one way or another in end :)",advice

"guide for gcse and a-level students so with admissions rolling out this month, i thought i'd make an info dump post on my experience coming in with gcses and a-levels. unfortunately, this subreddit and uw's website lack relatable information, so here's what i have to share.

i applied to the college of engineering with 8 gcses and 4 a-levels: biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics.

from what i understand, you can technically apply to the uw with just gcses, but you'll somehow need to prove your *""high school""* education level. for my case, that was 6th form. i'm not sure how that works, but you can always [ask the uw admissions office.](https://admit.washington.edu/contact/have-a-question)

and while you are at it, email department faculty you find exciting and build connections to learn more!

***university level credit:***

**gcses:**

there is no credit for gcses.

**a-levels:**

you can receive up to a maximum of 45 credits with 3 a levels. (for reference, that's about one years' worth of credits at a 4-year quarter system college (180 total to graduate)).

this means when i entered with 4 a-levels, i should have received 60 credits, but uw has a maximum in place, and i have no idea why. therefore, my transcript technically shows 60 credits, but a cap of 45 is applied.

***what's the benefit?***

well, i got credit for all my intro chem weed outs (142, 152, and 162).

(weed outs are classes where the median class grade is 2.7-2.9).

as for biol, phys, and math, those credits are useless as an engrud student. instead, they show up as 1xx and some other course numbers on my transcript, irrelevant to my intended major.

you can find the details for which classes you can receive credit for with [a-levels on uw's a-level policy page.](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/exams-for-credit/a-as-level/)

the standout benefit is having [**sophomore class standing** since you enter with 45 credits](https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-priorsp22). having a higher priority and registering for classes 2-3 days ahead of freshmen makes registration a little calmer. i've been able to get all my courses at reasonable times.

phys 121 was the only class i couldn't get for spring 2022, but i still had an extra two days to wake up at 6 am and get a decent class schedule together.

***how to submit my a-level certificates?***

[read this page](https://www.washington.edu/newhuskies/must-do/sending-final-transcripts/). i was able to get my school to email my certificates.

&#x200b;

***can you graduate early?***

depends, in my case, i've basically freed up 15 credits worth of classes that are required for my major, with some micromanagement and overloading (taking 18 credits per quarter instead of 15), i could graduate early, but my intended major works on a cohort system and you can't exactly graduate early.   
however, adding in a minor or taking additional cs courses when you are not in the major are freedoms i can take thanks to comming in with credits. and if i were to study a major where you can set your own classes to graduate, i could probably wrap up undergrad in <3 years.   


***are a-levels useful at uw?***

...yes? i guess.

i say that since i've only been at the uw for two quarters as of now, and i'm making my way through the engrud placement requirement classes.

a-level maths has saved my ass for the intro calc series; math 124 and 125, and probably also for 126 next quarter. about two years ago, a-level maths counted for credit for the intro calc series, but by the 2021-22 academic year, they removed math 124 and 125 and replaced it with 1xx.

that meant i had another weed-out series to get through. having completed math 124 and almost 125. i can confidently say if you've been decent at a-level maths, the intro calc series shouldn't be too rough. the a-level syllabus covers about 70-80% of the content in intro calc, and the missing parts are pretty easy to pick up that a-level kinda glossed over. but i am confident that if you've taken a-level math and received an a or a\*, you should be able to at least get a 3.5 for your intro calc classes. a 4.0 is ideally in your grasp as well. but you do need to work for it. grind those past papers.

i will assume a similar correlation for the intro phys and biol series. the level workload does set you up for success for your first year of college at uw.

that's all i have in mind at the moment. i plan on continuously editing this post going forward to include improved/relevant information. so if this post has missing information, i'll try my best and fill it in.

i remember searching through many discords and this subreddit to find information when choosing uw. i hope this post is helpful :)",discussion

"uw “pre-majors” and freshman admissions explained i was hella confused about the university of washington major stuff after being admitted yesterday and so i did some research that i will now share in hopes of clearing up any confusion 

**uw has three types of majors: open majors, minimum, and capacity-constrained**

open majors are majors with no requirements that students can switch into at any time. minimum majors are majors that have requirements (required classes and grades) that students must take in order to be admitted to said major. capacity-constrained majors are ones that have limited capacity and also have requirements to get into. 

**now keeping that in mind, freshman applicants can be admitted in three ways.**

**pre-major, direct to major, or direct to college**

what confused me the most was getting pre-major and thinking i didn’t get accepted into my major, when this was not the case

**there are only 19 majors that students can be directly admitted into that require direct admission to be in the major:** architecture, biochemistry, business administration, chemistry, computer science, computer engineering, composition (music), construction management, guitar (music), informatics, jazz studies, music, music education, neuroscience, orchestral instruments (music), organ (music), piano (music), strings (music), and voice (music)

**if you applied to one of the above majors and were admitted into a “pre-major” (such as pre-art, pre-sciences, etc) it means you did not get admission into your major**

**if you got into your direct admit major mentioned above it means you are guaranteed a degree from said major**

all majors with this form of direct admission are also capacity-constrained, so if you happen to have applied for computer science and are admitted into pre-sciences uw is basically saying “sorry you weren’t competitive enough for said major, please pick another major because you have a very small chance of getting into computer science”  

it is kind of a big bummer for those that applied to capacity-constrained majors because it essentially makes it very difficult for them to major in what they want 

**edit: however if you are not directly admitted to some of these majors you can still try!! it is just harder**

**”you can come to uw and then apply to architecture, bio chem, neuro, informatics, etc. they do have da but it is not the only way to get in”**

**it can just be insanely difficult for majors like cs and comp engineering**

**there are some direct-admission majors that are open majors, which mean if you get into uw you are automatically put into your major and also means that any student is technically guaranteed a degree from said major without meeting requirements**, these include: american ethnic studies, anthropology, art history, asian studies, atmospheric sciences, canadian studies, classical studies, comparative religion, danish, environmental studies, european studies, finnish, french, gender studies, geography, greek, italian, jewish studies, latin, marine biology, norwegian, etc…

**these majors are open majors, which means if you apply to uw under one of these majors and are admitted you automatically get in your major**

it also means that anyone at any time can switch into them with relative ease 

next up is pre-major. **the majority of students are admitted into pre-majors simply because their major doesn’t have direct-admission (usually because they are majors with requirements that are either minimum or capacity-constrained)**

to gain admission into the pre-major majors students need to satisfy prerequisites and meet admission requirements 

your likelihood then of getting your major is based on if it is minimum, or capacity-constrained, but even if it is capacity-constrained no one else has yet to be admitted in your year and you will all compete for admission when you declare your major 

for me i applied for physics (a capacity-constrained but non direct-admit major) so i was admitted into pre-sciences and will have to (like anyone else who applied and “got in” for physics compete with students to get my physics major later on) 

there are: pre-social science, pre-sciences, pre-architecture, pre-humanities, and pre-art 

**if you applied for a minimum or capacity-constrained major that does not have direct admission and isn’t engineering and got a “pre-major”**

**congrats!!**

**you were essentially admitted into what you wanted to be and just have to compete later on when you declare**

the last option is direct to college, which is only applicable for engineering.

if you applied for engineering and get into engineering you get “engineering undeclared,” and pick the engineering later

if you applied to engineering and do not get into engineering, you will then get a pre-major, which is similar to not getting direct admission into a capacity constrained major 

sorry this is so long but hopefully it helps make this weird admissions choice easier

why would uw ever do this

"clarification on engineering admissions i’m seeing folks asking about engrud vs pre-sciences, figured it could help to repost what i commented under another post:

engineering undeclared students are guaranteed *an* engineering major (provided you have a passing gpa and complete intro sciences), but are not guaranteed their top choice. if you’re aiming for hcde, bioe,, or meche, at some point you should consider backup choices. 

starting at the end of freshman year, there’s a competitive placement process where you submit a ranked list of engineering majors that you’ve satisfied the prereqs for. there are two main placement rounds, plus an early and a late round for special circumstances. *if during any round you receive placement, that becomes your major. switching engineering majors after placement is the same as applying at a non-engrud.*

also, for people looking at engineering degrees but didn’t get engrud:
some of the engineering majors always run a surplus of placements versus top choices. for those majors, if you can demonstrate interest academically and in your application, you still have a good shot at getting in from pre-sciences. for example, i’ve met a couple people who got into cive from pre-science. unfortunately, your chances at the competitive majors like hcde, bioe, and meche are still pretty low, however.",admissions

"out of state student hey, everyone!

i'm currently a junior who resides in alabama and is looking at out-of-state tuition for uw. i have a lot of family back in seattle and i've always dreamt of going to the seattle campus for college, but it's looking very....unaffordable at this point. i'm one of the strongest performers at my school (i'll attach my academics below if that would be helpful) and a ton of community service hours from being an eagle scout and ib. i also have a job at a restaurant that i've held for a year now (i know a lot of colleges love to see students with a job plus taking the hardest classes available), as well as taking business classes for 3 years of high school and ib business & management next year (important since i plan to enter with the intent of going to the foster school of business). i also plan on getting an internship at an investment banking firm over this upcoming summer.

for my college essay, i'd like to talk about how my adversities of growing up in an extremely evangelical and conservative state were enormous as a gay, atheist, and progressive teen (especially relating to scouting and the bullying and hazing i endured with that because of my sexuality), and how i turned these struggles into a way to create a strong work ethic. i'm hoping that would help them open their wallet up a little bit to me, but i genuinely have no idea.

**grades and academics**

* 3.95 gpa (unweighted)
* 4.40 (weighted)
* ib diploma

* multiple ap credits
* act: 29 (score taken without any studying. subject to increase)
* spanish honor society

* deca honor society (expected to receive in 2023)
* mu alpha theta

* 4 years of spanish (5 by the time senior year ends)

"it's that time: the annual 'go to community college (seriously)' plea the post title is tongue-in-cheek, but hear me out. there's a lot of sincerity in people telling you to do this.

it's admissions season, and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're one of thousands of freshmen who didn't make the cut for admissions this year. and that sucks. there's no diminishing it, especially if you're like many uw students who were a part of some honors or ap program that was priming you for the straight to college pipeline, and telling you that anything less was abject failure.

(or maybe you just have asian parents.)

i'm here to tell you why community college is a perfectly valid path that'll still bring you to the uw, how to make it work for you, and if i'm doing a good job, you might come to find it was the smarter decision anyway. this is coming from someone who applied to uw in his senior year of high school and, having finished that last semester with a 1.7 gpa, predictably did not get in. it was pretty devastating: high school sucked, and as a little baby gay, i couldn't see myself being happy anywhere but seattle. i applied again a decade later (you don't need to wait this long) having job experience, an aa earned with highest honors, and a much clearer direction of where i wanted to take my life - and these have been among the best years of my life because of it. so not only am i writing this to the freshmen who were hyped and pumped up to get here, but i'm also writing to people who also have started to wonder if college was in reach for them *at all*: because of their abilities, because of a garbage high school experience, because their family is poor, etc. **you can make it happen.**

i work with other cc transfer students *a lot*. it's not all sunshine and daisies, but there are minimal regrets - and a number of commonly-cited reasons as to why community college was the best decision for them:

**1)** **$$$**

the big one everyone will talk about is money, and for good reason: **a single 5-credit course at uw costs about as much as a full-time quarter at a wa state community college.** on the whole, you're going to spend about a third as much on your first two years compared to someone who went straight to uw. unless your family is already wealthy, this is a pretty attractive point to anyone - and it's half the reason why, as a first-gen student, grad school is even a future possibility for me. 

bonus for oos (non-international) students: cc tuition isn't that much more expensive for you compared to the baseline (~$130/cred vs. $116/cred), while uw would have you paying 3-4x as much - to the point that many will tell you to just not come here oos unless you're mega-wealthy. for oos students, this can be a great opportunity to establish yourself & work towards residency, but that is a *whole ass process* you'll want to talk to the professionals about.

further: community colleges usually have foundations that collect and hand out scholarships like candy to students with big aspirations, while here the odds can be so long you might have a better chance fighting the other applicants to the death in the gladiator pit under condon hall.

**2)** **better academics**

big prerequisite classes for more competitive majors - math, bio, chem, the works - are colloquially called 'weedouts', with pretty brutal exams and grading curves. a quick search on this sub will show you what the experience is like. many of these can be taken at a cc and transferred in - and you'll probably have a more accessible professor, classroom aides, and a class size about a tenth of what you'd find here. even current uw students will often dip a cc course during the summer just to avoid how utterly miserable they can be here.

beyond skipping weedouts, wa state ccs are among the best in the country. many cc professors very much teach foremost out of a passion for helping their students.  for the first time in my life, i didn't hate math, and i was able to ace statistics - which was unthinkable for me at the time (and uw straight up taught me to hate it again anyways lmaoo). i took biology with a professor who i later learned had began at that same community college, went to uw for undergrad microbio with awards for research excellence, and went on to get his phd. he played chill hollow knight ambience during our exam days. honestly, i'll probably remember more of my cc profs than my uw ones by the time i'm in my career field.

**3)** **easier accessibility**

this is a broad one, but: unless you're taking out loans or coasting on your parent's dime in the dorms, making an education happen at uw is *hard*. seattle has a high cost of living and many students have to live outside and commute 1-2h every day. prior to the pandemic, the university basically went out of its way to *not* offer online courses, while many ccs have them as a staple. the time and money you save just by not having to struggle to *be* here are resources you can put into yourself, your extracurriculars, and planning out your transfer to make the most of your time here.

**4)** **lots of involvement opportunities**

this is true at uw, too, but it's just more accessible here. become a student leader, go work with student life, get hired as a tutor, join a robotics club. tied in with the accessibility bit above, you'll have more room on your plate to volunteer or intern somewhere. cc is no different from uw in this regard, though: to make these things happen, you have to go search for them. people will tell you that the degree you get here matters a lot less than the connections you made or the opportunities you embraced, and imo that same message rings true for your community college experience.

**5)** **life perspective**

this one is ambiguous, but bear with me. my very first community college class was english 101. i sat a table with an international student from japan, a 40-year-old military veteran who was working on getting a degree in machining, and a woman in her late 20s who i later learned had been on the streets for about a year before transitional housing became available for her. by the time the quarter started, she'd been off the streets for just a month. in the span of her two years there, she'd go on to study it and get an internship with t mobile, who later hired her for about $70k starting.

when you sit in a stuffy lecture hall at uw with a bunch of college-bound kids from career college families, you rarely get these kind of stories. you don't get the same perspective on how 'success' can mean different things to different people, how it's equally as valid, and the sacrifices some people have to make in order to make their education happen. where's uw on the us news college rankings? what's your sat score? did you apply to ivies? at that table, *nobody fucking cared*. it's hard to describe how valuable that lesson is: the way it changes how you see and interact with other people, how it reframes your perspective on yourself and your education, and what it all means to you. you've probably spent 4 years on a rat-race gifted high schooler track; step off it, just for a little while.

this experience translates to your time at uw in a way that professors notice, too. professors fucking love transfer students. they've got life experience, tend to be less full of anxiety and bullshit, and are often among the best participators in their classrooms. student & campus jobs will love you, too. there's transfer shock, sure, but when you get here, a lot of transfers feel pretty ahead of the pack, and if they planned their transfer well they get to drop right into the heart of their major's core classes.

----

getting through your two years at cc is one thing, but if you can do that, honestly the path forward is simple:

1. use your time at cc to explore majors and figure out what you want to do.
2. take some time to think about how your desired career path impacts the world, or a problem or disadvantaged communities in it. there's a world beyond academia: engage with it.
3. get involved, somewhere. bonus points if it's tied into the above. think about how that's relevant to your desired career path.
4. go to class. get those grades.
5. write a bomb-ass essay that ties all the above together, and show them how dumb they'd have to be to *not* take you.

if you have your heart set here, for whatever reason, and didn't make it in: go to community college. seriously. i hope the ramblings of a former lost teen help at least one person out there also feeling like a lost teen today.",admissions

other notes: emailing new docs, asking for added consideration yourself, repetitive requests, will not in general help your application during the final reviews. they just don't have the bandwidth or right to stop and say your app is special and gets added treatment past the deadline. if anything you might be considered an annoyance or possible problem if admitted in severe cases. keep calm, they accept everyone that they can and you're likely months past the original app deadline now. there's also not the time to say what was wrong or how to improve your application and thousands of others. if you lost, review what you sent, what was in the university system for completeness, and follow the numerous sources online. plan to try again!",admissions

for this, clear all the confidence levels by switching to the all cards view > highlighting everything > edit properties > removing the confidence level tag > switch back to the test today view. after, once you start quizzing yourself, set the confidence level to how confident you are with 1 being the least confident and 5 being the most. cards in the test today view will automatically pop up on the day that you should be quizzing yourself (the lower confident cards will be tested more often than the more confident cards). 

you can also tag cards with core, moderate, advanced, and other things. one tip i have is to tag cards you think are way too easy with archived. this will make it so you will never be tested on the card again. this does not delete the card. it just is filtered out by the test today view.

thank you for your time :)

for those who are living on campus: how did you choose which residence hall to apply to/live in? i’ve heard that mcmahon and hagget don’t have free wifi which… doesn’t sound great. but i don’t know where to go from here. did you guys choose based on its distance from something? is so, what was it that you wanted to be close to? is there something that you did not want to live close to? did you choose due to the living learning communities? is there a residence hall (or type of room) that’s notorious for being challenging to live in? are some louder or quieter on average? or are they all similar enough that it’s not really a important choice? 

this is a sort of specific question but are there any residence halls that (usually) have a more reliable elevator than others? because of some medical problems i can’t walk very long (like 5-10 minutes max) and stairs are worse. 

on that line of thought, are there any residence halls that it’s easier to get disability accommodations in? i don’t think i phrased that right but essentially i meant is it easier in the more modern halls to do things like have a visual fire alarm or is the wiring not a issue despite when the hall was made? 

going back to traveling, how far do you think you have to walk in one day? what’s the most common transport (scooter, bike, etc) option you see? do you think the campus is wheelchair accessible? i know their website says so but i also wanted to ask people what it’s like to confirm lol. 

thanks for any responses :) i didn’t really know where to go and i appreciate any help you can give me! sorry for all the questions!!!





this is more personal and probably unnecessary but i’d really appreciate some help if you’re willing! i briefly mentioned it earlier but i *can* walk, just not for long or far. this is less related to housing but i still want to ask. since the campus is so big i don’t think i’ll be able to walk as much as i need to regularly. a bike *may* work since i’m sitting down but i’m not sure. and a scooter or skateboard won’t help since standing can be really painful as well. if i used a wheelchair (possibly electric because of the hills? idk) to get across campus, would it give a bad impression of me if people also saw me walking short distances? my highschool campus is small enough that i can (mostly) get by so this will be the first time that i’ve had to consider using a wheelchair for more than a day and it’s a bit nerve wracking.",advice

"should i s/ns? so today i had my math final, and i already know it went bad. i’ve also had a hard quarter and my math grade just is not good. right now, without the final test grade put in, i have a 75.85%, which if i’m not mistaken is a 2.0. 

i’ve calculated two possible grades:

in the case that i somehow got 100%, my grade would be 81.89%, or a 3.4.

in the case that i got a 50%, my grade would be 69.39%, or 1.4.

also, my professor will add 0.2 to my gpa because i completed extra credit.

 attending for running start (cascadia college). in combination with credits transferred from dual-enrollment evcc classes, i have 91 credits and a 3.969 gpa. however, i expect that the evcc credits won’t transfer since they were low-level classes (intro to physics, english, and some european history credits) so i plan on taking a few more classes before transferring.  i had a few questions though. 

1. how long do i have to wait before i can apply as a transfer? i’ve heard different answers from the people i’ve asked. an advisor said 2 semesters after i graduate while some other people (and the uw website) say i can transfer any time after summer quarter. is it different for people who applied as freshman? do we have to wait a bit longer? 

2.  what extracurriculars do you guys recommend me doing? right now i am working on creating a digital replica of my house using cad software. by the time i apply i plan on making some 3d worlds that anyone can visit in vrchat (its a personal hobby of mine). i am also a council member at the engineering club at my school. i also plan on making some vr haptic gloves this summer to mess around with. should i work on trying to get some more ecs? the club president is leaving soon so i might be able to take that spot or take vp.

3. what is the process of gaining research / shadowing around seattle like? i've heard of opportunities at fred hutch
4. ultimately what would you choose if you were given these options for undergrad:

(1) **uw seattle** — admitted pre-sciences, you probably know more about it than i do. love the location and social fit

(2) **santa clara university** — admitted for biology, grade inflation, but no r1 research status or much name recognition. would go there freshman year while trying to transfer

"questions - college decisions (update)  

hello everyone,

i hope you are doing well! i think i posted this question on this discussion before, but i want to receive people’s thoughts as certain things have changed monetarily. so currently as a high school senior, i have narrowed my choices down to uc berkeley eecs (direct admit) and the university of washington’s cs program as a direct admit (my in-state school).

previously, everyone advised me to choose uw due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently i learned that i was accepted for the regents and chancellor’s scholarship at berkeley. this scholarship now makes uw and berkeley cost the exact same for me. however, i am still having trouble deciding which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. the only reason i am considering staying in-state with uw is that as a dual enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, i will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with uw cs. at berkeley, i understand that eecs is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that i may have to attend university for 4 years instead. 

i know some may think this is a clear-cut choice, but i was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. for example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (i have heard from many that experience matters more than education)? what are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? overall, if cost isn't a factor, what would make you choose one over the other?

i've recently been accepted for the hcde masters intake this fall. i'm an international student scouting for apartments right now, and i've read on this sub that accommodations are cheaper/ better in neighborhoods around the university, and i'm looking at living in roosevelt / green lake area.

from what i know, the classes for hcde are conducted at night. i don't plan on having a car during my stay, so i'm curious how safe it is to walk back / commute back to those areas at night.

i've also been looking for apartments in this area - if anyone has any recommendations, that would be greatly appreciated. i've also read some apartments have had property theft / break ins? is this common?

"uw or ucsd for cs? help! i'm very fortunate to have both these amazing options for schools to attend cs but i can't decide between the two. i am a direct admit for cs at uw.

i'm an in-state student so ucsd's tuition (\~15k) would be much cheaper than uw's (\~37k w/ scholarship).  i'm very lucky that my family can afford both schools.

at the same time, uw's cs is ranked #6 on us news @ [https://drafty.cs.brown.edu/csopenrankings/](https://drafty.cs.brown.edu/csopenrankings/) while ucsd is ranked #11-12. i've also heard that it's easier to get internships as a cs student at uw than at ucsd. i was thinking that if it was easier to get internships in seattle than in sd, that i could make up the price difference in a few years.

what are your thoughts on this decision? in terms of prestige, academics, and overall experience which school would you choose if money was a factor and if money wasn't? thank you all for your input!

specific cs program questions:

\- what programs does uw cs have that are special?

\- how easy is it to get internships in seattle?

\- how are the cs clubs/orgs?

"q - uw cs internships (vs. uw bothell) hello everyone,

i had a quick question involving the internship opportunities for cs students studying at the paul g. allen school at uw seattle. is it often true that internships are still extremely difficult to come by even as an allen school student? i have friends at the school that mention that the career fairs aren’t really that fruitful and that one must apply to 400+ internships to barely get an interview. i was wondering if you all could expand on this(ex. sharing tips and advice for what helped you) and maybe share your experiences for this, as i know for a cs major getting an internship is a major step toward getting a full-time job later on. 

additionally, is it true that when applying for internships, all uw campuses appear the same on an application and have access to the same career fairs? i ask because i had read somewhere else that when applying on linkedin or other sites, uw bothell and uw seattle just appear as uw, even though both programs are significantly different in regards to name and prestige (no disrespect to uwb).

"looking for advice/opinions about uw's msme hi guys! i recently got admitted to the ms in mechanical engineering for fall 22 and i have a couple questions about your past or current experience with the program. 

1) what's your overall rating of classes and professors in the master's program?

2) for someone who is looking to go back to industry after completing the master's what are the career outcomes?

3) are resources readily available, like is there a good amount of projects one can join and contribute?

4) is it manageable to be in the masters program and have an internship at the same time?

"transfer decision hello,

i am currently a sophomore student aspiring to be a software engineering or any career related to that field. but i have been currently stuck in deciding for my next steps. 

i recently got accepted at uw seattle for its acms (dma) major as a transfer student from a community college. i applied for cs allen school as my first major choice but apparently i got rejected from the cs department i aimed for. apparently, i also got accepted to the csse major at uw bothell.

in terms of career prospect, what should i decide between the acms (dma) major at uw seattle and csse major at uw bothell? i initially thought that the dma program would be closely related to cs but i am worried that i would not be either enjoying the major itself or i will find difficulties in finding jobs with this degree. i have many connections of cs graduates who currently works at big tech companies and i could only find a single person who actually graduated with the acms (dma) major but he's currently working as quality engineer (i have done a little research about it but i'm still not sure what it is all about). 

a few things about myself, i am personally not a math person even though i don't often struggle with the concepts. i really enjoy coding/programming in general, i like building stuffs with programming but i also appreciate optimizations of algorithm to speed things up (e.g. data structures) which i believe are the things we learn from cs major. i have even built some fun side programming projects such as websites and discord bot myself. and as i said, i applied to acms as my 2nd choice since i believe it is close to cs and i felt like i would have no problem dealing with the math. i have taken linear algebra and ordinary differential equations with no issue and i got perfect 4.0 gpa for both. i feel like uw bothell's csse has good reputations but i find some friends of mine struggle a lot in getting internships and jobs. it must definitely be a struggle to get jobs from either school but i have always believed that uw seattle has greater opportunities in that regard. also may be unrelated with everything, i am not sure if this would also be a factor but i am actually an international student (from indonesia) and so are most of my friends (or connections) who i referred to.

would anyone mind giving some insights to this problem i have? i would really appreciate any thoughts on this. thank you in advance.",advice

university district has much more apartments to choose from, thus i am able to find a cheaper rent. from the videos, it also looks more vibrant with more shops (so more convenient). however, the crime rating is f according to areavibes: [https://www.areavibes.com/seattle-wa/university+district/crime/](https://www.areavibes.com/seattle-wa/university+district/crime/). i heard some horror stories as well around university district.

university village / laurelhurst / ravenna are much safer (b+ crime rating), but the number of apartments are much lesser and more expensive. i also heard that many older people or family with young children living there. much safer, but also much boring.

i've been living in the u-district for two years now, and holy shit, i had no idea things could get as bad as they have with my current landlord. i don't want to name him publicly until i move out at the end of this month out of concern for retaliation, but if you pm me i'll gladly give his name. i have been forced to live in absolutely disgusting conditions that the landlord either refuses to fix or at least refuses to hire outside help for. my freezer doesn't work and he ignored my text about it. my wall was leaking orange goop, and he said it must be a leak, ""took a look"", and then decided it wasn't a leak. i did the research and found out it was because he didn't dehumidify the space before painting the walls, and i told him that. he literally just said ""that's so strange"" as orange goop was slowly dripping onto everything i owned. the apartment feels soaking wet. everything gets moldy. there's nowhere to store shit in a way that doesn't get moldy. his solution was to give us a single dehumidifier, and not do his job to find out why the apartment is wet to the fucking touch. slugs were entering our home for several months. how did slugs get in? there are roots growing through the seal on my window. our billion year old stove spontaneously ignited. he took the batteries out of our carbon monoxide detectors and said it was because he was going to give us new ones. that was nine months ago. 

so please, share the names and companies that have fucked you over. nobody deserves to live in such disgusting conditions. we thought the landlord seemed like a good guy, but oh my god. he completely ignored my last text telling him that our freezer isn't working right. i've easily lost $100 or more on food that was no longer safe because it completely thawed and i don't feel like getting listeria!

this honestly comes as a bit of a frustration, since uw has always been my first choice. but it's the last week of the decision window and every school that has waitlisted me has waited until the last week—so i had already told myself that i'm either getting waitlisted or rejected by uw, and moved on.

i'm three weeks away from moving across the country to study out-of-state at a school that offered me a partial scholarship. it's the only school (other than seattle u) that offered me money—but if i'm going to a private school and paying out of pocket i'd rather experience something new, since i've lived in seattle my entire life.

"uw's marketplace/housing/ride-sharing app i have been working on this app for a while now and i am really excited to share it with you. it's a college marketplace restricted to students. you can buy, or sell anything you want to other students, ranging from dorm supplies, textbooks, lost& found, promote services, tutoring, apparel (anything really!) ride-sharing, to subleasing or finding off-campus housing for next year ...

you can only log in once you verify your **uw.edu** school email! (you'll receive a 5 digit code in your inbox). a lot of hard work went into it so make sure you check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters!

link to the app: [https://collegesouk.com/](https://collegesouk.com/) and tell your friends!

[follow on ig for support](https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/)😊

lastly, please go ahead and post something people are already using it :) 💚🐫 hope it helps ! - might be a little glitchy on galaxy hoping to fix that soon, also just want to mention that the idea is abstracted to support multiple universities :) each university got its own separate marketplace!

**please dm me** if you have an idea on how i can let more students know about this or if anyone is interested in contributing! (app dev or marketing)",discussion

"gcsdd at uw-bothell vs. uw-tacoma? is there any difference in quality? graduate certificate in software design and development.  

[uw-tacoma link.](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/set/programs/certificates/softwaredev)

[uw-bothell link.](https://www.uwb.edu/stem/graduate/gcsdd)

i'm sure no one has taken both, so they can't be directly compared, but any anecdotal evidence would be nice. i was accepted into the tacoma program and am still waiting to hear back from bothell, but i'm unsure which one i would choose if i had to.

the course load and curriculum seem pretty similar, but the main differences are tacoma is in python while bothell is in c++, and tacoma has classes on saturdays while bothell has classes mw evening. also the tacoma professors seem very engaged and passionate, but i haven't seen anything about the bothell professors. i would rather learn c++, but i'm worried that the bothell program may not be as high quality as the tacoma program. does anyone have any experience or advice?",academics

i was wondering what rsos would be good to join for minimal commitment but meet lots of people across many different majors and walks of life? just anything fun. i have also considered doing a class at the ima but thats a secondary option due to work.

all advice is appreciated for meeting people this year!! :d

\*one of the only things that might be holding me back from meeting some people is that i am not interested in drinking, parties, a ton of off-campus stuff (no hate to those who do enjoy these activities tho). i am busy and trying to live clean for a variety of reasons :p",advice
"interested in basic coding skills as a biochem student, any recommended classes to take? i’ve heard python would be the best language because of its use in laboratory settings. i hear its also one of the easiest languages, so i feel more inclined to take a course using python.

- thoughts on pursuing one or two classes on python, with the intent of laboratory work or life science?

- should i consider a different language?

- also, if anyone has a non-course type of class about coding they recommend, i might try it out this summer. something like khan academy",advice
"first time renting questions hello so if we decide that master bedroom is $100 more, we thought of 2 situations if rent is $2000.

"running start questions edit: seems like my high school counselor got things mixed up, and udub doesn't have a running start program. welp, oof to me lol, but thanks to everyone who replied!

hey y'all! i'm a current sophomore, planning to apply to udub's running start program. the website has frustratingly little information, so i would love it if someone could answer some of my questions!

1. do you apply to running start using the freshman application? are running start students considered freshmen at udub?
2. how do you balance high school and college? are college classes in the evening, or do you skip part of the high school day in order to attend college classes?
3. what's the acceptance rate for running start students? (i know i'm unlikely to get an answer for this, but no harm in asking lol)
4. i go to a competitive private high school here in wa, and at least 60% of each graduating class end up at udub. will the name of my high school help?
5. do you choose a major as a running start student, or do you just take general electives and core classes? i'm interested in industrial design for context, as well as hci
6. how easy is it to transfer to another college? i'm planning to apply to college in my junior year (so i'll only be in udub's running start program for a year) and i'm looking at some pretty competitive out-of-state schools. if i apply to another school (ex. cmu or stanford), would i be considered a sophomore there because i did a year of running start?
7. do running start students have the same access to classes, facilities, and opportunities as other students?
8. do you need the sat in order to apply? if you do, i'll be applying test optional (it was a somewhat last-minute decision, so i didn't have time to prepare for the sat). how negatively would this impact me?
9. what are your overall thoughts on the program?

i am an upcoming freshman at wwu in the honors program. 

i've lived in washington my whole life, and have always wanted to attend uw. it's been my dream college- i love the school and i love seattle. 

i applied to uw and uw honors as a high school senior, sporting a 3.9 gpa, multiple ap classes, and few hundred hours logged of community service / volunteering. despite my portfolio and various professors proof-reading my essays, i was waitlisted and eventually denied admission to the school. i suppose that it was a fairly competitive year of admissions.

i ended up going to wwu as part of their honors program, and i am about to start my first quarter.

i understand how premature this is, but i want to start thinking about transferring to uw for autumn quarter next year. i understand that i have been at wwu for a considerably tiny amount of time, but through my few interactions with professors and through other stories i have heard about wwu, i don't think this is the place for me. the strong liberal basis of their teaching is too much for even me, a democrat. of course, i have plenty of time to reassess, but for right now, i have some questions that i would really appreciate being answered:

how difficult is it to transfer to uw from a 4-year university? 

i've heard the acceptance rate is low for 4-year transfers, but is there anything specific that i can do that would bolster my chances?

can i reapply to the interdisciplinary honors program at uw as a second-year transfer?

how i grew up translating for my family and friends and that sparked a passion for languages, and eventually programming (code language).

while there is research and a case that race in physical descriptions is ineffective (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3120676) it does not take into account the environment of the investigation. i do not find descriptions provided by uwpd any more useful than 'a college aged person with average college height and average college build.' for this reason, i believe additional identifying attributes, in this setting, could be incredibly important to the success of an investigation and the safety of students. it is unfortunate uwpd does not feel like they can release racial details and chooses to undermine their own investigation at the expense of safety.",discussion

* a challenge faced
* a personal hardship or barrier overcome

i'm doing really bad in one of my chem class, and every single time i'm about to ask for help from a ta, or i'm about to go to the chem study center, i can't. i don't mean i get too nervous or shy. when i'm about to ask for help, i end up having an extreme panic attack. i mean i can't speak, and i'll be trembling so much i can't write properly. i'll usually start tearing up, or hyperventilating.

this is because i wanted to ask a question, and that's it. 

it's because of my ptsd. if i ever asked my mom for help with my homework as a kid, she would get so mad at me. she'd yell or threaten to hit me. so now when i'm about to ask for help, my brain still sets off alarms and tells me that it's not safe. that i'm going to get hurt if i do that. even despite every ounce of me knowing that's not true anymore, it used to be. and now it's just like an instinctual reaction that i can't control. i try so fucking hard to fight it, but it's just a part of me. 

i don't even know how to start asking for help. i've considered writing something down and showing it to the ta when i ask him for chem help, but i don't want to waste his time when he could be helping other people who are actually able to voice what they are trying to ask. sometimes it makes me worry that i'm still too sick to be here. believe it or not, this reaction i have is a huge improvement to how it used to be. it used to be much worse. 

i'd just like to hear from anyone else at uw that experiences something similar. if you have mental illness, how does it affect your performance in classes? are there ways you've figured out how to cope? it's especially frustrating because i know for a fact i have the capability to do good in class. i just need help to get there, and i don't know how to ask.


edit: tysm everyone who has replied!! you've given me a lot of really good ideas on how to proceed and be able to get help. i didn't realize how much this would help, but i genuinely feel a lot less hopeless right now. this shit is really tough, so seriously thank you for all the helpful suggestions ❤️",discussion

this survey will remain active from oct 31, 2022 until nov 15, 2022 after which i'll tally the votes and summarize its findings to share with the broader rental tenant community.

questions i'm hoping to get answered:

\- what types of property manager (e.g. owner/operator, on-site property manager, off-site property manager) have you worked with in the past?

\- what is your top goal as a renter (e.g. temp, long-term, rent to buy eventually, get government funding)

\- what are your most resource-intensive/painful/urgent challenges as a tenant?

\- what workarounds/solutions do you currently leverage to mitigate against your top challenges noted above?

\- on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), how satisfied are you with the current workarounds/solutions listed above? why?

if you prefer to not answer publicly, a dm is always appreciated.

# biomedical health informatics track

\*\*\*bhi is a track, so you must be admitted to the informatics major to declare your track. to do this, just schedule a meeting with an info advisor and they'll help you out from there.\*\*\*

these experiences will vary based on your professor and when you take the course. i will rate the classes on difficulty level out of 10, workload out of 10, interesting content out of 10, and whether the class is an easy 4.0. make sure to look up the professors on ratemyprof before registering for the class!

&#x200b;

**bime 300 - transformational technologies for biology, medicine, and health:**

this class was not the most exciting class, but presented some difficulty as there is some programming with pandas and jupyter. this class explored the health systems and the intersections between informatics and medicine. there were a lot of assignments that i found didn't help with learning, and the professor did not go over how to do the code (he just assumed that you would be able to do it because the prereq is info 201). a lot of students felt lost, and a lot of my group-mates straight up did not help with group projects (but this is probably due to being online). the only things graded are reading responses, group projects, presentations, and participation.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* reading responses due tuesdays and thursdays
* oral presentation (tell-a-story). this is very lowkey, you get to choose your topic and story to tell.
* 3 team projects. these involve a coder and a writer, but the professor ended up not balancing this so well with teams. make sure to try and get more than 2 people in a team. from my memory, there is some data handling with thousands of medical data which involves filtering, analyzing clinical notes, and finding genetic data to prescribe medical advice.
* lateness policy on a case-by-case basis, doesn't provide late days for assignments.

difficulty: 6/10

workload: 9/10 \*

interest: 3/10

easy 4.0? more like ez 3.5 - prof is a harsh grader zzz

professor: john gennari

\* lots busy work :( and lots of time teaching yourself jupyter if you have never used it before. i also was assigned as the coder for most of the projects, so i was paired with freshman/sophomores that have never taken a coding course somehow (info 201 is a suggested prereq, not required).

&#x200b;

**info 486 - designing for personal health and wellness:**

i thoroughly enjoyed this course. most work is done with group projects, developing an app to promote personal health and wellness. we get to explore how to make these sorts of apps effective with high usability. the professor was super engaging and accommodating. i definitely felt like i learned the most from this course. it gave a similar learning vibe as info 360, with plenty of time to work with your groups in class.

the labs were definitely the most redundant, but you need to attend for credit.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* reading responses (30%), due before every class (twice a week)
* group project (40%). this is graded by multiple deliverables throughout the quarter.
* individual assignments (15%). written reflection papers, lab assignments.
* participation (15%). this is very loosely graded. i took this online and you only needed to 'react' every once in a while.
* slightly strict with deadlines, but will accommodate with you if there is a good reason.

**bime 435 - informatics in healthcare:**

bime 300 but less code, more app design. the course goes more in depth about the healthcare systems and technology. i honestly can't recall enjoying this course very much, but it followed the basic standards of an info class with developing an app without any programming. the professor is super kind and doesn't grade harshly. labs were mostly recaps/time to work with your groups.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* buying the book is not necessary.
* course topics:
   * the us healthcare system
   * foundations of informatics in healthcare
   * application in clinical informatics
* weekly assignments (35%). quizzes, discussion boards, other assignments. quizzes are fairly easy if you skim the assigned readings.
* labs (35%)
* final project (30%). written and oral reports, had to present with group in front of the class about the project we developed.
* late assignments can be turned in at a cost of a few points (can't earn full credit).

easy 4.0? yessir

**info 478 - population health informatics:**

coding, coding, coding. get ready to use the r language that you learned about 2 years ago. the lecture content was extremely boring to me, and since it was an 8:30 am class, i have to be transparent and say i barely went to class. she recorded lectures so i definitely used panapto to go back when she explains certain topics or assignments. i would honestly recommend *not* skipping lectures, as they were helpful for the assignments. this class is all about data visualization and representation. you have assignment deliverables similar to info 201, as well as a final group project. i honestly don't know how i earned a 4.0, but i'm assuming that if i can do it, so can you :d

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* workbooks (30%) 1pt each every week.
* assignments (35%) 10 pts each, usually every week.
* course project (35%). you begin to work on this around 3 weeks before finals.
* super flexible grading. you can submit late work within a week and still get 100% credit.

# other courses to mention

**info 442 - cooperative software development:**

as you may be able to tell, i'm not a coder by any means. in this class, you get to create a team of 2 developers, 1 product manager, and 1 designer to *cooperatively develop* a web app. this course is similar to info 340 in that you will need to have some experience with front-end development. pm and designer definitely have the easier job. the lectures weren't exactly helpful to the overall project, but it was interesting to learn about how real products are made, including developing pitches, timelines, and program versions.

*for seniors thinking about capstone group formation, a lot of people (including myself and my team) found our teammates for capstone in this class. try to find people with similar project interests as you!*

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* going to class is required - you are graded based on creating your agenda each day with your team (what you accomplished the last week, what you're going to accomplish this week, and any questions you have for the ta/professor)
* labs are super easy activities. you learn about integrity, working with a team. i honestly hope they change the structure of this, it felt like a waste of time as a senior who already learned this 40 times during my time at uw.
* course reading is free and required. i learned a lot from the book and it helped with my understanding in the class. also, if you have your info 340 book, be prepared to keep that tab open.
* assigned and selected readings (14 pts)
* labs (20 pts)
* project assignments (56 pts)
* final presentation (10 pts)
* extra credit is available
* no penalty for late submission of *reading or lab assignments.*

difficulty: 4.5/10 \*

workload: 6.5/10

interest: 3/10

easy 4.0? nope. but a 3.5+ is very doable with minimal effort.

professor: cheri allen

\* difficulty will be based on what role you are. the developers definitely had the harder job, but as the pm, i did my best to support my team and offered extra insight/help.

&#x200b;

**cse 163 - intermediate data programming:**

i'm not a coder. i wanted to avoid cse 143 like the plague. i heard that this class is much easier and i believe this to be true. hunter is a great lecturer and is super engaging, the content that you learn is actually really helpful for other info courses/bhi track courses (you learn pandas, python, jupyter - would be great to take this before bime 300). the final project was definitely my favorite part of the class, we got to present our posters at the end in a fair. the grading is much more lenient, and you get resubmissions. i'd say the format is similar to cse 142, but there are no tests, just graded weekly checkpoints. i learned the best from the lectures, so don't skip those!

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* checkout any cse 163 website, [this](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163/22sp/) is the one from my quarter.

"in need of custom uw flag...we're surrounded by cougars! hey guys, i'm hoping someone can help me out here.

my brother owns a farm surrounded by wsu cougar fans. for christmas, we want to setup a giant ~20' uw agriculture flag on his barn to fight back a bit. :) something like this: https://i.imgur.com/m15h3zq.png

here's his request...

---------------------------------

for a christmas present, i’d love a large husky flag to hang on the side of my barn.

as you know, i have a 100 acre farm just off highway 2 between monroe and sultan.

my neighbor farmers, and nearly every farmer in western washington went to pullman. they all have custom wsu license plates and were really snooty before the apple cup last weekend. a few of them have painted their tractors crimson and put cougar decals on them. i’ve even seen a wsc flag with the word “agriculture” printed on the bottom margin of the flag.

because my large barn faces highway 2, it would be a great spot to hang a flag for everyone to see as they drive past. as a nod to all the local farmers who went to wsu, i was thinking that placing the word “agriculture” below the w logo would be a nice touch. my neighbors all have teenagers, so perhaps this could be seen as a recruiting opportunity for the university, and not just a friendly jab at the cougs.

i took a minute and grabbed a screenshot of the google street view of my barn as seen from eastbound hwy 2. i added a flag on the barn to represent my concept, and i pasted an image of the flag below. the font and spacing of the text could be improved; i just used the default font from my photo editor. the width of the flag on the barn is 20’, i don’t know what proportions ‘normal’ flags have, but assuming the souvenir 3’ x 5’ flags are standard, then the flag for my barn would be 12’ x 20’.

"living for less than 12 months but paying rent for 12 months? edit: living at nolan, the m, the accolade, oliv, hub u, or here seattle? please read this. 

i recently discovered that my apartment building uses a “12  instalment” system for my rent schedule but i’m only staying for 11 months and 8 days. all of those 12 instalments are equal (even for the month where i will only live for 8 days). they quoted “$1000/month” as my rent (figure changed). they are charging me $12,000 in total for 11 months and 8 days. but i think it should be $11,000 (for 11 months) + $266.66 (for 8 days) = $11,266.66 

on their website it says that rent is based on monthly frequency which means that $1000 is based on monthly frequency. but when i do the math $1000 only seems to cover for 28.5 days and not monthly frequency. (month means 30 days)

they said this is how it’s done and it’s all buildings do it. is this correct? i asked other people at similar name buildings (nolan, the m etc.) and they all knew about it and agree to this??? 

if divide $12000 by 11 months and 8 days, my monthly rent comes to $1064.77/month but that is not what was promised to me ($1000/month) 

am i not understanding this correctly?

edit 1: the amount of people equating 12 months with installments is proving to me that this is in fact a terrible way to phrase statements on a legal document. if you are living in any ‘name’ buildings (especially on brooklyn ave) please please please look at your lease and compute your monthly rent to see how much you are actually paying

edit 2: i researched more into this and found that only hub udistrict presents the fact correctly and coherently on their website [if you scroll towards the bottom of the page](https://www.americancampus.com/student-apartments/wa/seattle/hub-u-district-seattle/floor-plans#/detail/228-4bed-4bathstandard-fall2023_fullterm_9_23-8_24) “rates/installments do not represent a monthly rental amount (and are not prorated), but rather the total base rent due for the lease term divided by the number of installments.” this is the truth. the number that has been quoted to you is not your monthly rent. other apartments say “rent is based on monthly frequency” which is not even close to the truth.",discussion

"meeting people and partying outside of greeklife i have a really hard time meeting people in here. i consider myself very extraverted and confident, but it’s been a struggle for me and a skill i had to learn. a lot of the time people are taking classes with friends and not interested in making new ones, and speaking frankly a lot of the student body here is extremely introverted and socially awkward in general. it’s really gotten me down. i tried joining clubs but most of the clubs seem the same way too, people go with friends to do an activity and don’t talk to people they don’t know. i’ve made some friends in clubs but it’s tough because they’re activity rather than social based for the most part. there’s a couple good ones though, but many are really inactive as well as cliquish. they are also extraordinarly limited, for such an outdoorsy city it blows my mind that the winter sports clubs are the only outdoor clubs. (considering joining hws or snow club) i had a lot of interest in the sports clubs, but after tryouts the upsetting fact is that i am not athletic enough for college sports. i can workout and get in shape, but chances are by the time i am in good enough shape it will be too late. i also like partying. i know people always say “just go to house parties” but the fact of the matter is none of my non greek friends are going to parties, and most house parties tend to be a small group of close friends, which is pretty awful for meeting new people. i’ve never been invited to or seen a larger house party. i’m sure i can get invites if i keep making friends but this goes back to the original problem of uw and seattle being tough places to make friends in. the seattle club scene is a national joke unless you want to go to an lgbt club, and the bars i went to on the ave were a miserable experience. i had more fun and made more friends in the line at earls than i actually did inside earls. there’s this one frat that basically begs for guests but if you know who i am talking about you know they are good for nothing except a really good laugh. i rushed this quarter and had an awesome time. i got bids from a few fraternities with guys who’s company i really enjoyed. the fact of the matter is that it’s a huge commitment, and before making it i want to be 100% sure about the choice. are there any other alternatives to a social framework that i should take a look at? any clubs i should consider joining? i’m a hella outdoorsy guy, big on hiking, photography, backpacking, that sort of thing.

"complete guide for free (or cheap) course material going into winter quarter, a fact as old as money itself remains at uw — nobody wants to pay for something they don't have to. when looking at comically expensive textbooks, it's best to look through as many places as possible to see if you can get them for free!

this primarily covers how to get **textbook / book pdfs** but also includes a short section on **movies and tv** for classes that require watching such.

# best methods for getting free course material

1. **looking on google / reddit if someone has already asked for it!**

at large universities like uw, half the time most textbooks have already been searched for on reddit. on subreddits like r/textbookrequest (and more) individuals can receive help in their search from redditors. however, most of the time you can really just google **""\[textbook name here\] reddit""** and find a textbook pdf posted by a random redditor. i personally found my $165 spanish textbook using this method, but there are certainly other **very overpriced** uw textbooks that can be found utilizing this strategy.

2. **using an online pdf database!**

personally, i've used [https://annas-archive.org/](https://annas-archive.org/) (a comprehensive database of other pdf search sites) to find quite a bit of free pdfs for my classes — but guides such as r/freemediaheckyeah's comprehensive wiki (([linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/freemediaheckyeah/wiki/reading/#wiki_.25b7_pdf_search))) include other pdf search engines you can use! additionally, you can easily find other search tools and websites using different sub-reddits that focus on accessing free course material and literature.

*note: some books found on websites like annas-archive are provided in ""epub"" format; but you can convert epub to pdf on quite a few websites for storage on google drive. e.g:* [*https://cloudconvert.com/epub-to-pdf*](https://cloudconvert.com/epub-to-pdf)

3. **buying it used! (of course)**

this may be obvious, but buying used books (online or at the bookstore) is cheaper than buying them new. do this if you don't mind slight use and want a physical copy!

4. **using internet archive (and converting to pdf if you really want!)**

internet archive has free books that you can access and borrow! if this is the only place you can access the book for free, there's always the option of converting them to pdf so you can annotate them on google drive or preview using a pretty convoluted method that i can go into detail more about later if anyone wants to know (unfortunately it doesn't seem internet archive has an easy method to convert to pdf).

**edit: you can convert internet archive books to pdfs easily!** all you need to do is utilize this article ([article here](https://www.isolveit.xyz/2021/05/download-borrow-books-from-archiveorg.html)) which uses the software at this link ([encrypted adobe ebook to pdf software here](https://www.ebook-converter.com/drm-removal-bundle.htm)) and adobe digital editions. it has a free trial that only gives 12 book downloads, but you can probably just delete and reinstall the software if you run out (i mean i'd assume it'd reset to 12 again? probably?). so, if the book you're looking for is on internet archive (and it probably is if it's a regular book) you can use the software to convert it to pdf and get annotating! (*note: not sure how many actual textbooks are on here though*)

5. **for movies and tv for classes**

for all those needing to watch movies for a class, sometimes a teacher might suggest paying a small fee for a movie on amazon. this is certainly an option, but who wants to give more money to jeff? there are other free streaming sites shown here in a comprehensive guide: ([r/freemediaheckyeah free streaming sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/freemediaheckyeah/wiki/video/#wiki_.25ba_streaming_sites)). my personal favorite for free movies and tv is [https://moviestowatch.tv/](https://moviestowatch.tv/).

*note: always use an adblocker on these sites! a good* ***free*** ***adblocker*** *is ublock origin (*[*https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)*)*

(this is not pirating as they're on other sites that are streaming these! ""pirating"" would involve you downloading it yourself)

6. **use the library!**

if you have a book available at the library, just check it out! you can just keep renewing it as much as you need.

# not sure what else there is, but if you have any other methods let me know below and i'll add them!

i know to take this with a grain of salt but i’m curious if anyone has any helpful opinion about my chances of getting accepted to the uw bsn program as a transfer student. i am currently out of state. uw is my top pick. the waiting period is hard. i have a 3.84 gpa all pre-recs done except ochem and one logic course. i have 100 volunteering a perinatal unit and i worked for a nurse practitioner as a massage therapist for 6 months. she wrote my letter of recommendation. i sent my essays to the future nurses club and the head of the club said i have good experience and a clear passion for nursing. i implemented all the refinements to my essay that they suggested. i have contacted the admissions department about any question i had and they were very helpful. all signs feel like all get in but feelings can be very wrong at times. i keep seeing people sharing that the had to apply 2,3, and 4 times before getting accepted. i really don’t want to go through that as i am an older student and time is extra valuable to me. its discouraging to be going through this process as the requirements at universities where i live are actually surprisingly harder than uw’s requirements and the schools aren’t even as good. so i just want to get in and be able to move forward with my education. that’s why i am willing to pay out of state tuition and move. i really have my heart set on uw. anyone have any reassuring thoughts?",admissions

i understand that this new technology brings challenges.  but as someone with adhd who bit off a bit more than she could chew this quarter, chatgpt has been an absolute godsend.  my side of the chat with the ai during class looks a bit like:  ""what is this term?  alright now explain at the high school level.""  ""give me a 100 word summary about this topic that the professor mentioned in the context of this other topic.""  ""write a nursery rhyme about this concept.""  ""take the topics i have been asking you about and present them back to me in the form of a data tree.""  ""i didn't understand your last answer, try reframing it.""  i feel like i have so much more control over my understanding of difficult concepts than i did before, and this gives me the opportunity to have difficult topics explained to me until i understand, no matter how long it takes.

"i need help i applied as a freshman at udub foster school of business for autumn quarter 2023.

on my application i said i was taking courses during my gap year but by courses i meant simple online courses, from coursera, etc. i then got an email saying that they needed to see the credits from the courses they thought i took and my hs diploma. i sent the hs diploma. but not the credits they asked for because i did not have any because these courses did not give credits, only simple pictures of certificates, and i am still completing them. i sent a few emails explaining that these courses would not give me credits because they were not from a college. they were just simple online courses. i sent a few emails explaining this and got a response from a different email saying that they got my hs degree that i sent and that if they needed anything else they would let me know. i thought it was all set and while i was waiting for the decision response i logged into myuw and see this message ""we have given your application to the seattle campus of the university of washington an initial review and one or more required [documents](https://apps.admit.washington.edu/missing_item_portal/app/) were not received by the closing date. it is now too late to be considered for admission for autumn quarter 2023."" does this mean my chances of entering have gone to shit??? :(

&#x200b;

i have no idea what to do now and am panicking. i thought udub had understood that i had no credits to show yet because the courses i said i was taking were not college courses they were just simple online courses like ""learning python"" or the ""google it cert"" and i had not even completed them yet.

i cant believe that such a simple miscommunication from both ends would result in my application not being reviewed. i am not sure what to do nor what to explain. please help, this has devastated me. i am international student from south america and have always dreamt about entering this uni. i suppose that they will understand and do something since it was their fault as well. i sent various emails to various addresses explaining this and none were responded directly. i then got a separate email saying they got the document they asked for and that was it (my hs degree)",admissions
"my chance of getting in? i’m currently a junior in high school, and my target university is the university of washington - seattle campus. i am an out-of-state resident, but my family will be moving to washington the summer after i graduate. this obviously won’t help with my application, though.
i’ve been looking into the school for probably almost a year now, and i sort of have my heart set on it. i definitely overthink things like this, so i’ve had it in my mind that “oh i’m worried for no reason, i’ll probably get in”. however, i have been thinking otherwise lately.
i didn’t have a good gpa my freshman year (the online year). i was in gate (basically pre-honors) classes, but had an overall gpa of 3.66. my sophomore year, i was in mostly honors classes with a 4.0 (4.33 weighted) the entire year. now, as a junior, i’m in almost all honors / aps, giving me a 3.83 (4.5 weighted) gpa for the first semester and also likely for the second. i’m predicting this same gpa for my senior year, giving me a cumulative of 3.83 and a total of 6-7 aps.
as of now, i have 0 extracurriculars. i do have reasons for this that i won’t get into, but i do plan on joining some my senior year.
i’ve taken two psats so far, and i do plan on taking the sat and the act. my scores on the psats have been an 1160 and then a 1290, giving me a projected sat score of 1340.
i have looked into it a lot- and after compiling averages online and even putting my estimated cumulative gpa and sat score into calculators, i’ve found that my chance of getting in is around a 57%. i will of course try to apply directly for my major (biochemistry), but based on my knowledge about the school, a direct admission into my major would be a miracle.
so my question here is, what do you guys think about my chances of getting in? there are probably plenty of things to consider that i haven’t taken into account, so i would like some outside / more informed opinions. is 57% too high or too low of an estimate? and it’s obvious that 57% gives me a higher chance of getting in than of not getting in, but is it not really a good enough chance? should i set my sights onto another school? i obviously plan on having safety schools, but i just feel now that it’s unlikely for me to get into uw. this is upsetting, of course, but i do still want very honest opinions on my situation.

"this is your end of quarter reminder: sometimes you'll get a shit grade, and that's okay! i'm posting this just because i had to get a whole ass pep talk from my mom last night about this. i did pretty terribly in highschool/running start and then quit community college for two years, but last spring i went back, started getting nothing but 4.0s, and applied to uw as a transfer. my first quarter was brutal but i managed to get a 4.0 gpa which meant a lot to me because the classes were all pre-reqs for the capacity constrained major i'm about to apply to. this quarter...has been brutal in a different way. i accidentally went four years without taking a math class (and i was already bad at math, i passed my last math class by like, 1-4%) and found out i'd need to take another math class before applying to my major. so much fun! unsurprisingly, even while putting in a lot of time and effort, i'm not doing great. 

it can be really, *really* frustrating to put so much time and effort into a class you're still not doing well in, and i know a lot of y'all might be feeling that frustration right now. it can feel like all the stress and work was for nothing, but i'm here to remind you that at the end of the day, it's fine. you're going to be fine! i know some classes are more important for our majors than others (my math class just needs a 2.0 or higher and doesn't factor in to my acceptance to my major) but regardless, one fucked up grade once in a while is not going to be the end of the world. even if you're looking to get into a capacity constrained major, grad school, or whatever, it's not going to ruin all of your plans and it doesn't say anything negative about you as a human being!

lots of uw students are, much like me, a bit neurotic about grades. at the end of every quarter i see posts like ""i got a 3.4 in this class, should i off myself? should i drop out and go work at mcdonald's until i wither away? should i go build a bunker in my backyard and live out my years there to avoid the humiliation of getting this grade?' and i think posts like that have potential to make people feel even worse about their actually low grades. even if you fail a class, you can retake it, you can adjust your plans, you can figure out something that'll make things work for you. it's not the end of the world and as long as you're putting the work in, that's what's meaningful and that's what's going to get you the place you want to be. i've accepted my fate and plugged the grades into canvas, and i'm finally at fucking peace with the fact that a 65% on my final will get me a 2.5, which is almost an entire grade point above my last grade in a math class. i'm fucking patting myself on the back for that, and you should pat yourself on the back for your hard work too!

1) i know thar the program is meant for data and information professionals. i have seen few people go for sde roles after this program, but want to know if it would be a very difficult path to take. for more context, i will have 3 years of work exp as an sde when i start my masters.

"uw foster msis vs uw tacoma milgard msba 
hi all! looking for advice!

received admits/offers for ms information systems program offered by foster school at uw seattle campus and the ms business analytics program by milgard school at uw tacoma.

feel both the programs align with interests of getting into a future tech/business management role focused towards product mgmt, business or data analytics. both programs are 1-year and work compatible. the msis program is slightly broader in tech areas than the msba program. msis is obviously more expensive to pursue (tuition - 44k vs 26k ~ 70% more) and looks more competitive (based on admission data).

"phys 121: purchasing e text &amp; access code to mylab &amp; mastering (💀 why are there so many options…? i’m confused 💀)

so according to the [physics 12x website](https://phys.washington.edu/121-122-123-courses), there are five options to purchase the etext and/or the access code. the access duration for online learning system varies from 18 weeks to 18 months.

this information completely differs from the payment screen on pearson. 

there are three options on the payment screen:
- option a: with e-text access with access to mastering (18 weeks) - $74.99
- option b: with e-text access with access to mastering (up to 24 months (???) ) - $124.99
- option c: without e-text access (up to 24 months (???) ) but with access to mastering - $79.99

the “up to 24 months” confuses the hell out of me because the physics 12x series website says that the access duration is 18 months… (but i digress)

i plan on taking physics 121 in the spring quarter (which is now) and physics 122 in winter quarter 2024 (which is… later (lol) ).

essentially, would i be okay in buying option c when i have a pdf copy of the textbook? i’m confused because the options only say “access to mastering” so would this include mylab and mastering??? is access to mastering referring to the hw??? will i be okay without the etext?

**context**: i've been self-learning spanish for years, and never had the chance to take any courses in spanish back when i was a student. when i moved to the us, a professor at a different university let me audit his class and it was great. i've moved to seattle now and would love to be able to sit in on the advanced spanish literature classes at uw.",advice

"honest uwb to uws chances. 
hey guys,

ik there are already a few posts abt transferring from uw bothell to seattle. but i just wanted some input from y’all.

so a lil background: im currently a freshman at uwb(sophomore credit-wise), and am currently working towards completing my prereqs for computer engineering. im really interested in informatics at seattle, specifically the data science stream. this is because of a couple of reasons: 
1. ive taken a couple of data science courses(outside school) that have rlly interested me in the field. i also plan on doing some small projects in the mere future.
2. the campus and college life, or rather the absence of it at uwb.
3. ive just started taking a class at seattle(cross-campus) and i love it✅

by the time i apply (sep 2023) my gpa should be around a 3.75 and i would about 70ish credits as im also taking summer classes. i kinda am already done with info prereqs too.

please lmk what y’all think abt my honest chances of transferring 👍, and if y’all have suggestions.",admissions

socially, i know a lot more people at uw and  love the city/campus. i do want to branch out and leave home though so ucsd would be a great option for that, especially with the weather and gorgeous campus. i really don’t know what to choose so any insight on research opportunities, relative competitiveness, and academics would be appreciated! thank you",advice

"i got into uws (as a pre-science student) and uwb (as a pre-major student), and i want to go into cs. what should i do? with may just around the corner, i am a little concerned about the decision i'm making.

i really want to go into computer science, but, since i've been rejected from uws's cs school, i'm also considering informatics as a backup major. however, i've also been offered admission to uwb, where the cs major does not look as crazy competitive due to the smaller campus size. plus, i've already completed multiple of the prerequisites, so i might even be able to graduate early if i get into the program.

i don't know if i should struggle over informatics (which has a barely similar set of prerequisites) when i would rather go into cs. i would pick uwb immediately, but my only issue then is whether or not one program is valued over the other, and whether it would be worth pursuing a still very competitive major in something i'm not as interested in for another major in a different campus that could potentially affect my resume.

putting it all into words, my issue here is a lot more personal and complex than i thought, so let me whittle it down to this: is working for more time to attempt to get into uws's ischool (informatics program) worth more than potentially taking less time to attempt to get into uwb's csse? does it matter at all? i should probably also note that i am most definitely going to be doing stuff outside of school to help my resume.

follow up question: would staying in uws for one quarter, and then transferring to uwb if i want, be a better idea? i suppose i'm confused on where to enter into initially.

"incoming husky worried about getting rescinded i was recently admitted to the uw for the cs major and the honors program as an out of state student. my stats were fairly good before senior year (4.0, 1550 sat + ecs). however, i really tanked hard starting this fall (especially after submitting college apps). i earned at least 3 bs in my 1st semester and astonishingly received a d in ap cs a (i had no prior cs experience by the way). i stopped attending school consistently due to a string of numerous illnesses (flu, covid, staph infection) starting in november 2022 and that has led to me ""snowballing"" my lack of preparation for tests and school in general. 

in short, i am very worried about my 2nd semester grades (potentially dropping below 3.0) and whether or not i would be rescinded for this precipitous drop in academics, and i am unsure if my explanation to the admissions office about my illnesses would suffice.

"why you might be lonely at uw hi all,

there seems to be a substantial population of lonely people here, and i wanted to give a few reasons as to why that might be.

1. quarter system. people are busy, and it's a nonstop barrage of exams and assignments. on top of caring about grades, everyone around you is trying to pile on extracurriculars. there is a relatively high turnover of new people that you will meet between classes.
2. it's a big school. you have to put in more effort to meet up with somebody, and it's easier to avoid someone or get lost in the crowd.
3. cliques. uw has a few surrounding feeder schools and california students, so people stick to what they know.
4. you're in a major with a higher workload. related to point 1, but if you're doing labs all day it can be harder to find someone you like.

i left out the freeze because it depends on who you talk to, but people around here are friendly. this isn't to say that there are some things that you as an individual can't improve, but i would consider the above to be decent obstacles to making friends. there are folks that do like you for you.

"🐺 tired of walking through cherry blossom tourists? join husky flying club and learn how to fly a literal airplane over them! | 🎮drones | 🛠️ aircraft build | 🖥️ flight sims | ✈️ real-life aviation | join husky flying club! howdy r/udub,

you may have seen or spoken to us at new student admittance day recently, but here's a recap on our club dedicated to **giving huskies wings & breaking down socioeconomic barriers that come with participating in aviation**.

we are **husky flying club**, an rso on campus dedicated to **anything aviation-related**. we have grown exponentially in the past couple of years, now with four major components of our club:

* 🎮 our **competitive fpv (first person view) drone racing team** which meets regularly and hones their flying skills.
* **🖥️ hangar 51**, a dedicated space for **extremely advanced hotas and virtual reality equipped flight simulators** which all have dcs (digital combat simulator) with an attached club squadron that faces off against other schools around the country in dogfights, bvr (beyond visual range) engagements, and mission scenarios. the sims also have microsoft flight simulator 2020.
* 🛠️ the **aircraft build team**, a student-led initiative to build an airplane (the rv-12is) which upon completion will be used for research in future graduate-level programs! a variety of ""toolbox teams"" meet regularly to work on various parts of the aircraft.
* **🏫 free ground school** taught by a cfi (certified flight instructor) who is committed to taking you into the skies at the lowest possible cost!

🖥️ hangar 51:

hangar 51 is husky flying club's own flight simulation room located on the top floor of clark hall. the room is equipped with **3 vr-capable flight simulators**. the simulators have both **dcs (digital combat simulator)** and **microsoft flight simulator 2020** installed and ready to play. there is also an faa-approved redbird flight simulator that you can use to earn 5 flight hours with one of our cfis! our club has dedicated instructors who are excited to coach newcomers on how to fly, whether they have zero experience or plenty of real-life flight time. additionally, multiplayer coast-to-coast events are held which feature combat pvp **campaigns/scenarios**! husky flying club members **are able to access the room whenever they schedule it out** as long as they attend enough meetings. newcomers must have an instructor or existing member with them to access the room outside of meetings. if you have your own sim setup, you are free to join our dedicated server during meeting times!

&#x200b;

🎮 drone team:

fpv drone racing is a competitive sport where drone pilots wear ar-goggles to race drones from a first-person perspective. these racing drones can go upwards of 60 miles per hour! racing courses consist of a series of obstacles that the drone must navigate through, with the pilot having the fastest lap time winning. we encourage our pilots to use the drone simulators in clark hall whenever they want. outside of racing, our drone team will provide many opportunities for **developing your skills in engineering (nice for your resume**). assembly of drones requires detailed soldering, testing, and shop skills.

&#x200b;

🛠️ aircraft build: in case you also did not know, our club is building the **very first light sport aircraft** on campus (rv-12is)! this is an extremely unique and lucrative project to be involved in and looks great on a resume to practically any engineering-involved company, especially boeing! while this opportunity is full for the quarter, this summer we will still be working on it and planning our projects for this year. all huskies are welcomed into our space at the mech e building during this time!

&#x200b;

🏫 free ground school: mondays on our discord server feature virtual lessons taught by a certified cfi. these lessons, sponsored by emerald squadron aviation llc, are free in our club so long as you are a husky student and have a discord account. if you consistently do well enough in the course, our cfi will sponsor you to take the written knowledge test. this is huge towards gaining your private or recreational pilot's license, considering such lessons are typically hundreds of dollars at local flight schools.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

outside of our drone racing team and flight simulators, husky flying club places a big emphasis on **building connections between our members and people in the aviation industry.**  our club holds “aviation talks”, social qna sessions where we bring  people from the aviation industry such as pilots or engineers to talk to  our members. in addition, we are working toward getting our members who  have zero flight experience some time in the air with actual pilots from the local civil air patrol.

"subleasing 3 individual bedrooms in u district apartment hey y'all! my 2 roommates and i are trying to sublease for the summer (starting now until end of september 2023), but you don't need a group of 3 people - just 1 person can sublease a single bedroom, 2 people can lease 2 bedrooms, etc. 

rent is $1349 per person per month, which includes all utilities (sewer, garbage, water, electricity, internet). i'm personally willing to negotiate the rent price if you want to rent out a single bedroom, so message me and we can talk about figuring out something that works! the complex also has study rooms, a gym, a sauna, and a rooftop deck with mini-kitchen and grills, all of which are included amenities. the apartment is on brooklyn and 50th; the walk time to the burke edge of campus is 5-10 minutes, depending on how fast you walk.

i will say - the apartment complex is here seattle, which, if you've heard anything about, is rather notorious for its shitty management. having lived here for about a year, i'll say that most of the general qualms with the complex aren't actually about the apartment (which, to be honest, is pretty damn nice), but more about the management's delay of the apartment opening (our move-in was delayed by, like, 3 months). so, if you're subleasing, you don't have to deal with any of that shit, and you just get to move into the apartment on time like a normal person lol. also, to be so honest, management right now is pretty chill. i think most of the front desk workers are uw students, and they never check on your apartment. so, not bad. the apartment itself is very nice (our kitchen has massive counterspace lol).

anyways, message me if you're interested and/or want pictures! like i said, i'm personally willing to negotiate the rent price, because frankly, paying less on my rent in an apartment i won't be in over the summer is better than paying the full rent. also willing to tour for those in the area, or record a video tour for interested parties, so just lmk!",student life

i’m graduating in a few weeks, and moving elsewhere for a job in july. that said, my apartment (which i share with 1 very chill roommate) has a lease extending to september. 
the move is gonna be a bit expensive so i’m not expecting to be able to double rent for that july-september range, and the fact that it’s only two months makes it hard to sublet. i could potentially also start the rental immediately after graduation (june 10) but until then i need to be living here until then.

"""uw students, make me hate uw"" post follow up [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/139yma9/uw_students_make_me_hate_uw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to read my last post. this is for any prospective uw cs students that are either waitlisted or accepted to pre-science and having a hard time deciding between uw and your local cc.

hi guys! it has been a month since i last posted here, and i was overwhelmed by the personal experience, support, and advices i got from current uw students. you guys were all brutally honest about your experience, and i just want to say thank you, i genuinely appreciate each and every comment on that post.

today, saturday, may 27th, 2023, i have decided to decline uw pre-science offer and committed to my local community college, and will test my luck again with the uw cs transfer admission cycle.

as a lot of you have said, the true ""college experience"" is what you make it to be. i might be missing out on the ""traditional college experience"", the freshmen dorming experience, the parties, the late night studies at odegaard, the walks with friends on uw red square, etc, but i'm sure that i will gain a lot of meaningful experience at my local cc!

for the anxious high school students that are reading this, there is no right or wrong option, college admission is random sometimes (i'm an instate student waitlisted by uw but accepted by ucla, ga tech, uiuc and just got off uc berkeley waitlist). don't be disheartened by setbacks or waitlists; sometimes, life has a way of working things out in unexpected ways.

as for now, uw is still at the top of my transfer list and i hope that my journey at the community college will be fruitful and lead me back to uw in the future.

good luck to all the prospective, current, and graduated uw students, and to anyone navigating the college admissions process. i hope my story can provide some guidance and reassurance to others facing a similar dilemma. may your journeys be filled with growth, learning, and success.",advice

"uw vs. uo? i hate to be redundant with all of the other ""why udub?"" posts, but i'm beginning to reach a level of indecisiveness that i'm desperate. i just got off of the waitlist for the university of washington—seattle last saturday, so i'm checking out the campus for a second time before i make the final decision by june 10.

uw was my top, top choice when i was applying to colleges originally, but once i was waitlisted, i had to accept that my admission was not guaranteed and opt for something else... after lots of comparing and contrasting, i fell in love with the uo. i was admitted into their honor's college, and the marching band was a definite. housing is guaranteed with a good system for connecting with potential roommates, so it feels like i've got everything in place over there. however, while the marching band and the honors program are no longer guaranteed at uw, i know that the school has a prestige that may be kind of stupid for me to pass up. i'll be a psychology undergrad, but i still feel like the rigor and quality of education are important to me. i'm also from nyc, so seattle's more urban environment that is meant to accommodate a big city rather than just college students feels more familiar than eugene.

the costs of both schools are pretty comparable, as i'll be paying out-of-state tuition for both. when i look for honest opinions online, i solely see overwhelmingly positive or drastically negative responses. i realize that i'm asking one of the uo's top athletic rivals, but i'm just waiting to sign the dotted line and am curious about others' opinions.",advice

i had a 3.8 gpa with only taking ap courses my senior year and also pretty mid ec’s at the time of application. my ec’s were actually pretty good by the end of the year though but it was too late by then. the two main ec’s that i had after the application was an internship at an energy company and ta for an dual credit intro to programming course. so it’s understandable why i was rejected. i probably would have still been rejected with those ec’s considering i hadn’t taken any ap courses until senior year.

i know that as an oos student attending a 4-year, my chances are greatly reduced but i’m wondering if i still have a reasonable chance. i would also appreciate any advice on maximizing my chances at being accepted. i also saw on a related post that someone took online courses during the summer at a washington community college and was accepted. would that actually work?

my question is - should i skip math 124? i took the math 124 placement test and scored 9/10 (which makes me qualified for the class) + i scored a 7 in math aa hl in ib. i also looked over the math 124 and 125 syllabus and i'd say i've covered around 90% of the stuff in high school (for both classes). although, i'm still a bit worried because 1) the calculator's different and i'm not sure how much of an emphasis is placed on its usage in the class, 2) they're both weed-out classes and i'm not sure if choosing math 125 without having studied 124 would be a good decision (especially in my first quarter), and 3) i'm planning on taking chem 142, engl 121, gen st 199/engr 101 along with math 124/125 and i want to maintain a high gpa for most classes since they're prerequisites for my intended major.

next, how many cheap food+grocery options are there nearby lmao, it seems like everything good is on the ave 😭. does anyone go to costco from campus? is it an easy/quick bus ride without lots of changes? and are there any east asian household item stores nearby (like daiso/miniso/others)? 

what about travel from the airport? i see most people take the lightrail, but is it easy with luggage? especially if you have at least 2 suitcases? 

lastly, what are the most important things i should bring before moving onto campus, vs stuff i can buy later? my current list is:

* my commute is about 90 mins (i'm probably overestimating)
* i have credit for math 124 and 125 but wanted to take math 124 to refresh myself
* i plan on tutoring elementary kids online on monday (4-5pm) and wednesday (2:30-3:20pm)
* i'm hoping that the large gap between classes and being in a school environment forces me to get better habits and study more.
* right now, my biggest worries are the large gaps between classes and chem 142
* sidenote, i could've had a schedule with much tighter gaps between classes, but it would've had me taking an 8:30am class and i seriously doubt i could wake up/drive safely at 6:40am",advice

"full-time job + 20 hours/wk for a grad program; doable? i recently got accepted for the msim online program, early-career accelerated track. the whole thing is supposed to take 40 credits to complete, with each quarter worth around 8 if i were to take two courses.

i am expected to put in at least 20 hours a week into school. and that's already on top of 40 hours of a full-time career job that i have.

i am unsure if i'll like this new change in my life. currently, i am really happy with my work-life balance, working all morning, heading to the gym in the afternoon, and then enjoying the evening for relaxation. i don't know if this'll eat up too much of my time.

but then again, i winged my way through undergrad, not really putting do-or-die effort, put in about 15 hours/week, and still graduated with 3.8. i had nothing else happening back then so time wasn't such a crunch, but undergrad wasn't such a big deal.

"should i take bio 200 and phys 114 together? i'm heading to my 2nd year and i want to get all my intro stem classes done before i apply to a biology major. i've heard taking 2 stem courses is rough and hard work-wise, especially if you want to get a high grade, but i kind of want to try for myself what it's like.

in my 1st year i took only 1 intro class per quarter (bio 18o + chem 142 and 152) and i developed a pretty good study strategy that helped me get a 4.0 on all my classes. for example doing a dummy load of practice problems to really get the concepts done. i looked at some practice exams for bio and phys and i feel like it might be manageable if i do the same routine of doing more practice exams than memorization.

the thing is that i only like studying in short bursts, which is why i find doing multiple timed practice exams more engaging than stuff like reading textbooks and looking over my notes. which means i don't think i'll do well if both bio 200 + phys 114 are too time-consuming to study for.

anyone have experience/advice in these classes? should i leave the phys classes for my third year instead (since i heard that's the hardest of all the stem classes)?",advice

currently stuck in a limbo where i have been waiting for two months for the japanese instructor to get back to me. i have emailed four times (decided to limit myself in fear of being entitled) already yet they have not responded to me. i get that it’s summer, but it’s one thing to respond to the email of other students while choosing to deliberately ignore mine. eventually, i asked the academic advisors for assistance and they intervened, although the professor still has not made contact.

what makes this extremely disheartening is that japanese 101 is currently full. i did my a&o session back in june and registered then when there was, by minimum, at least half of the class avaliable. but no. not anymore. i’m so tired of dealing with all of this. i won’t even be able to complete my degree anymore on time as i have to wait a whole ‘nother year for japanese. ugh. ugh. ugh. should’ve never attended a large school that failed to take in consideration of my needs. i’ve done everything i needed and yet nothing. just nothing.

uw psych grad school applications open on september 1st, and i’ve been panicking…a lot. i’m entering my senior year here, and i got into the psych major last year, on the b.s. track. since then, i’ve completed almost all pre-reqs. i just have statistics, one or two electives, and labs to complete. however, this also includes psych 499. 

psych 499 is undergrad psychological research and it’s required for the b.s. track. all summer, i’ve been applying to research/reaching out to faculty to get credit for this course, but nothing has really solidified. i need research experience to graduate, but also, i feel like it would come in handy on my grad school application.

i joined the huskies@work program, and was matched with the most amazing mentor who taught me so much about the psych graduate program at uw. since then, i’ve been really considering a gap year before applying to grad school, but i’m not sure. i want to go on the clinical route and work in neuropsychology, but to apply, i feel like i need to get experience in. at the moment, i really don’t have clinical or research experience. with the application opening up soon, i feel like i should apply, but i also feel like the chances of me getting in are quite low with my lack of experience. i have a competitive gpa, and experience working and volunteering, but nothing specifically psych related.

"tip for freshmans: don’t feel ashamed if you don’t do good in the weedout courses i wish i was given this advice when i first came here. at uw weed out classes are meant for you to do poorly as stated in the name. sometimes they are natural weed out courses like ochem for premed students, but at uw it’s meant to filter out the students who are able you achieve impossible standards and the students who aren’t able to get the highest grades. at uw, it’s merely to control application/acceptance volume into the major. 

in my experience, i took the accounting series since i’m a business major. the actual content you learn in class is the same anywhere you go. they don’t explain concepts “better” than other institutions. the content isn’t more difficult to learn as well. at uw, i felt like they gave you less examples and were expected to understand everything on your own whereas the community college made sure the students understood the concepts and went into every detail. despite that, the big difference are exams. 

exams in the weed out courses felt insane compared to what i was used to. the professors threw in so many trick questions to test what you retained from lecture. for example, they gave a bunch of unnecessary information and expected you to use only the information required. it wasn’t as straight forward as the practice problems in class. a lot of the problems you had to think through them, but they felt extremely long and required multiple steps. also, the exams were extremely long like a thick packet of paper. they also barely gave any partial credit. most students were rushing to finish at the end or didn’t end up finishing.

with all this, it was difficult to achieve the grade i wanted in the classes because of so many factors despite studying my ass off. it was like i understood the concepts, but the tricks and time constraints got to me. it felt humanly impossible to finish on time and make zero mistakes. this is especially difficult for people with learning disabilities like me. 

your grade in these classes do not reflect what you know as long as you studied and put in all your effort. they are meant to trip you up or else everyone will have straight a’s which uw doesn’t like. there are people with the ability to meet these standards, but the system doesn’t let everyone. it’s easy to feel like you’re not built for this school. you have to realize that the system is meant to create gaps at this school so only the top performers get a spot while people who are below fight for a spot. it’s really fucked up. but that is why you should not let it get to you. 

despite all this, there are classes that aren’t so tough and are supportive of learning. you should cherish those classes especially in your first 2 years.",discussion

i am a biochem major who needs to take chem 452 and 453. i was signed up for the course with professor gary drobny, and he seems very charismatic and friendly. however, his lectures go at 100mph and are hard to follow even though i am confident in my calculus abilities and read the slides beforehand. i also felt as though the topics do not apply to biochemistry as much as i hoped, and it feels just like a more advanced physics course (pistons, springs, etc). we were supposed to have our first quiz this friday, and we have not gone over any problems in lecture and the homework is very tedious. because of this and my 17 (science) credit workload and financial aid discrepancies, i ended up dropping the class to take it at a later time. my questions are as follows: who is the best professor to take this course with? i would not mind taking professor drobny again if needed, but i am open to other suggestions. also, is the 452/453 a/b summer option a doable thing? i have heard people mention the final (especially drobny's) is particularly brutal in that sequence. not looking forward to taking the series at all, but i understand it is inevitable.

tl,dr: who is the best professor to take for chem 452/453 and when should i take them?

thank you all, and go dawgs!",academics

"sick-like people on campus let's be honest here. if you are sick and have symptoms of either the flu, the common cold, or maybe covid again, please stay home and get some rest. however, this is my personal opinion and you do not have to follow what i tell you to do, because you have your own situation on being sick and going to campus. if you do come to campus while having symptoms, please do west a mask. the previous labeled discussion about this was more of a rant instead of an actual discussion, since the poster complained about sick people in lecture halls, licking doorknobs (really? licking doorknobs is what sick people actually do? do i live in the same world as you?) and wishes yall the worst. do not mind his words, since if he was the one who was the sick person who comes to campus, he would wishes himself the worst. apologies in advance, but this is your logic. don't be upset at me when you created the option of possibility.

if you are just having coughing, coughing is not always a sick symptom. i have had asthma, so i did occasionally coughed, especially in cold weather. sneezing is also in the same category. you can sneeze if you have pollen in your nose or something along the sorts of that. if you're superstitious, sneezing would pair with someone talking about you. 

now for the people who would love for people who are sick to wear a mask or stay home, why would they listen to yall? now obviously, it would make sense for people who are sick to take preventive measures for themselves and other around them. but are there actual repercussions in not doing so? will they be slapped with a fine or a ticket for coming to lectures when they have symptoms of sickness? no, they would not. if you did that sort of option, obviously that would deter people who are sick coming on campus, but we all know here it's a stupid idea. or you can complain. here. on this subreddit. anonymously. i don't know you, nor you don't know me. social media is a wondrous thing, don't you think?

anyways, again, if you are sick and having sick like symptoms, please stay home and get some rest. if you want to come to class while having sick-like symptoms, try to please wear a mask. 

one more thing, being a victim to any situation is not trendy. the reason i'm stating this is because of a certain individual today stating that being a victim is trendy. you know who you are. i will not be saying who said this, since he deleted his comment on this. other people would probably state your reddit tag without a second notice, but not me. because i am not you.",discussion

"transfer senior panic i transferred in fall ‘22, and was told that while all of my credits from my oos, non cc university would/ should/ will/ can/ (etc) transfer over and i’ll have plenty of credits besides the credits i’d need take within my new engineering major to graduate. now, i’m being told that that isn’t the case, and my advisers are way to chill with me taking an extra quarter to graduate (i’m supposed to be and was told many times i’d be a spring 2024 graduate). 

for a variety of reasons, i absolutely cannot delay my graduation for an extra quarter. i’m luckily getting in state tuition, but one of the personal conditions of my transfer between my family and i was that i would graduate on time. i absolutely cannot take an extra quarter, and my advisers aren’t working with me on this. 

even worse, i’d be taking an extra quarter to fulfill requirements such as freshman year physics or a 100 level writing class that i was unable to get into. i find this incredibly frustrating, and i’m not sure what to do besides overload my schedule for the next two quarters to make my graduation deadline. has anyone experienced this, and what was the solution you came to?

"why are professors able to get away with being ""bad at technology"" at this point? sort of a rant, sort of an actual question.

in my time at uw, my experience with professors has varied in all sorts of ways, but one things that's truly been all over the place is their ability to use the basic technology-related tools provided to them. it seems to be most problematic when it's canvas. a lot of professors seem to make it work, but a good handful of professors are completely incompetent when it comes to using canvas. i'm not sure if it's technically a requirement for classes here to use canvas, but it seems to at least be the standard expectation for students.

i'm currently in a class where the canvas page is a total wreck, **and** the professor hasn't provided any sort of outline for the class like many professors do in the syllabus, so it's somewhat difficult to keep up with what we're supposed to be doing. there aren't even dates for quizzes or exams posted. the professor loves to say she's ""so bad at technology"" and stuff, but she's like...thirty. to help you further picture what the class is like, she can barely make a slideshow work. maybe i'd understand if it was a professor who was old as the hills and about to retire, but it seems ridiculous that professors who have been around technology for the majority of their life and career struggle to use the standard tech for their job. it's just aggravating when a professor doesn't keep their canvas coherent and also doesn't provide a road map for assignments in the syllabus.

so on to the actual questions i'm curious about, does uw provide any resources to professors to figure out how to use canvas/other basic tech they're expected to use? does uw offer guidance for how professors can best structure their class/communicate that structure to students? is canvas required to be used in classes?",discussion

"questions about safety, transportation, social life, and academics at udub hi!:) i’m a singaporean student who is considering studying (undergrad) psychology in udub. i have some questions below!

safety in the city:
coming from a place as safe as singapore (and also because i’m a small asian female), i'm wondering about the safety aspects in seattle. what's the general consensus on when it's safe to walk outside, especially as a female, whether alone or in a group? any safety precautions or tips i should be aware of? i'm looking to work on my situational awareness to adapt to this change should i end up coming to seattle. 


safety in the canpus: 
i saw the post about uw being ranked the 26th most dangerous campus in the us. do y’all say that ranking is valid? were  there really murder, assault or rape cases recently? 😅i googled ‘washington uni murder’ and got nothing in the campus directly. 

transportation in seattle:
do i need a car in seattle? are the cities/towns surrounding seattle accessible without a car? how safe/reliable is public transport? how safe is it to take when i’m on my own, and what time is the latest i should be on it? and for those times when i'd like to explore the surroundings, how much would a rideshare like 'grab' typically cost? 

exploring washington's nature:
i've heard that washington has loads of beautiful nature.  how do those of you without cars manage to enjoy the natural beauty? any tips for public transportation or organized group trips for hiking and such?

udub as a commuter school?:
is udub considered a commuter school? i'll be arriving in seattle alone, and i'm eager to make friends not only with other international students but also with americans. are locals generally open to new friendships? are there any tips for breaking into social circles? are high school cliques challenging to break into?
also, i’m not a huge drinker. in fact i’m not a fan of alcohol although i don’t mind drinking occasionally. would this negatively affect my social life a lot? i’m wondering whether it’ll be difficult to find a bunch of nerdy friends in udub.

lastly, is it common to eat out with friends? i’ll be coming to udub on a budget and probably can’t afford to eat out every day so i wanna know if i’ll suffer a lot socially if i pack my own food or something.


participation in school clubs:
i'm planning to join some school clubs, like some boardgames/d&d clubs, outdoor clubs, and more. do members typically hang out for meals or drinks after club sessions, or do most people head straight home?


psychology program at uw:
lastly, i'm interested in the psychology program at uw. could anyone share their experiences or insights about it? are there direct postgraduate pathways, or do most require work experience?

also, does the school have industry connections and good internship placements? i am hoping to do some marketing related internships in the us just in case i don’t make it into postgrad for psych.

"how competitive and math-y is an economics major? hi, i am a intended philosophy major who is looking to double major in economics, i have heard they are a good combination and i have a bunch of extra credits from doing ib/ap in high school so i either double major or graduate early lol

anyway, i'm not a huge mathy guy, i did pretty well in high school calculus but was always more of a humanities guy which is why i have philosophy as my major which is my passion. however, i took an ib econ class in high school and enjoyed it, though it was pretty basic concepts. how much math is involved in the more advanced econ classes at udub?

also, from some older posts (6-7 years ago) on this sub, a common discussion is about how rampant cheating is in upper-level econ classes. apparently, there are hella international students who will do anything to get the perfect score in these classes, and since they are apparently curved pretty hard,  honest students' gpas get tanked. as a student who is planning on going on to grad/law school, would these upper-level econ classes tank my gpa and lower my chances?

so is the state of econ at udub still very competitive, gpa-killing, and rampant with cheating, or is it better now? should someone who's not really into math still take the major (ba, of course, you couldn't force me to take all the math classes required for an econ bs)?

also as a side note, i was looking into sociology as a possible double major with philosophy instead of econ, since it seems to overlap with econ concepts a lot but just a lot less math.

also also, i have had a meeting with my advisor about all this stuff but bro just told me to ""take an econ class and see if you like it"" which was ultimately pretty useless ngl",academics

for the purposes of this post, i'll keep claims to the land brief. both jews and palestinians have a claim to the land. however, jews have always had a presence in israel. from around 1300 bc to the construction of solomon's temple to the sicarii revolt to the spanish inquisition, it was always historically seen the jews' land. as such, jews aren't just white. they are also mizrahi, sephardic, iraqi, ethiopian etc. even some ashkenazi jews aren't completely white either. 

in 1947, the un had created a partition plan that was going to split israel between jews and arabs. at the time of british mandatory palestine, jews and arabs had both owned about 10% of the land. jews were legally immigrating to british mandatory palestine to escape pogroms and persecution in europe. the british restricted jewish immigration in 1939 due to escalating arab riots and terrorist attacks (which you can read about here:  [https://www.timesofisrael.com/1921-jaffa-riots-100-years-on-mandatory-palestines-1st-mass-casualty-event/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/1921-jaffa-riots-100-years-on-mandatory-palestines-1st-mass-casualty-event/) and here:  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/white\_paper\_of\_1939](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_paper_of_1939)  ).  jews subsequently illegally immigrated to israel to escape the holocaust. 

when israel had declared independence in 1948, surrounding arab countries had collectively attacked to destroy the nascent jewish state. while there was some forced expulsion by irgun, the overwhelming majority of arabs were fleeing war or were told to leave by their leaders. wealthier civilians had left earlier prior to the attack because they expected a quick victory over israel. at the same time, it is estimated that \~800,000 jews were forcibly expelled from surrounding arab countries to live in israel where nobody shared a common language. 

2. israel's siege of gaza is legal, and does not constitute a war crime. 

israel is not engaging in collective punishment, but please understand that war isn't really fair to anybody. hamas' attack on 10/7 has been aptly compared to our 9/11. israel has a legitimate casus belli.   for the sake of israel's national security, they can't have a neighbor that has a mission to completely destroy them. the distance between hamas and israel is the distance between campus and downtown, and sometimes even closer. it's like if al qaeda was based in long island since 1984, and lobbed rockets into nyc every year up to 9/11. 

what complicates matters is hamas uses human shields and civilian infrastructure. they do this because they understand western morality sees any civilian death as bad. there is a distinction between accidentally killing civilians in a warzone and targeting civilians indiscriminately.  generally speaking, once hamas converts civilian infrastructure to a military installation or plans to, it becomes a legitimate idf target. hamas is legally, morally, and politically responsible for any civilian death that happens in gaza because they put them in harm's way.  

because of hamas' historical use of humanitarian supplies, israel does not have to supply water or electricity either in wartime. for the moment, israel is only sending utilities to south gaza but it can be assumed that almost any supplies will be intercepted by hamas. prior to the war, hamas had used israel's lending of water to turn around and build rockets.  instead of building any sort of energy infrastructure, hamas pretty much spends all their fuel on firing rockets.

the conflict sucks. i hope that the current round of fighting resolves quickly, and that israel will help rebuild afterwards. what nobody is prepared to do is occupy gaza again after israel unilaterally left in 2006.  if palestinians are committed to a 2 state solution, they should elect somebody who isn't hamas after the war. again, i hope we can keep discussion civil and respectful.

"israel-hamas poll in a nutshell here's the reasoning on the choices:

i support israel and palestine, but condemn hamas - i support two state solution but fuck hamas and their atrocities

i support israel, but condemn palestine and hamas - i support israel cuz they are my bffs no matter what happens

i support palestine, but condemn israel - palestine people are people too, you can't treat them like animals

i support saving all civilians, both israel and palestine, but fuck both hamas and benjamin (israel pm) - both elected governments and head of states are corrupted to its core and both sides of their civilians should elect a new government 

i support neither/rather not say - pretty much you shut your mouth about this or don't have a final opinion yet

ah shit here we go again - another broken ceasefire for the 66th gazillion time and more human suffering that both sides blame each other for

"sucked in an academic misconduct case? i’ll start from the beginning, i was with my lab partner doing lab projects. i did my part and threw the files for him to modify for the final submission. i also turned in my files on the due date just in case.

a few days later, he went to demo the file with ta. i was not present due to personal reasons and i notified the professor. my lab partner found out there was some issue with the file so he turned to his friend in another group for help. they are friends so another group gave him the entire project and my lab partner straight up copied parts of the code. however, i was notified of this through messages but i didn’t bother to say anything because i was with my relative at the hospital.

and apparently ta found out that there are some files that are identical (since they demoed to the same ta) and reported to the professor.

today the four of us had a meeting with the professor, my lab partner tried not to put the blame on another group so he was saying he “took some pictures of the code and copied it” but the prof didn’t buy it.

the professor suspect that me and another person in another group (not my lab partner’s friend) are “potentially getting sucked in the situation for what other people did” but because he didn’t believe the story my partner gave him, so he is reporting the incident to the college level and we should hear back next week.

this is my first time being in this situation, just want some advice or some scenarios you guys think might be happening.

what are your thoughts? if you’ve used this restroom (or any other one like it on campus???), how was your experience? and if you haven’t, would you use it when there might be someone of another gender in there with you? and would people support/feel comfortable if this kind of bathroom situation became more common across campus—like if buildings without existing single-use gender neutral bathrooms had **some** of their gendered ones degendered for inclusivity?",discussion

"are you ""actively"" thinking in your daily life? i was talking with someone today that said the majority of people are not thinking in their daily life. i was confused by what they meant and they explained that they believe when the average person is going about their business they don't think about anything beyond what is happening directly around them. they said that most people cannot be bothered to think about anything outside their own bubbles, and that some people don't even have any thoughts going through their head most of the time.

i think this is a bit absurd. i've met a few people that this probably applies to, but i think the vast majority of people are actively thinking about the world around them. when i am doing my daily routine, i am constantly thinking about everything. what do i want to do with my life? how can i be a better version of myself? why is x issue going on in our society? why do people do x thing? what makes someone right or wrong morally? 

i feel like when i am doing literally anything, my mind is constantly somewhere else. sure when i am in class i am engaging with the content, or when i am talking with someone i am focusing on the topic at hand. but when i am doing routine things like commuting, walking between classes, eating, exercising, etc... my mind is constantly focusing on a distant unrelated topic.

is this the norm? i started getting concerned when my friend was talking about this. i started thinking back to interactions i had with others on campus, and a lot of people really do seem to have no thoughts... when i would talk to people from classes most people don't seem to be able to talk about anything, even the course content! i know this isn't a major specific problem either because i have taken classes from majors where people are ""smart"" (cs, amath, physics, etc...) and people in these programs don't seem to be able to talk about anything either.

is this the ""seattle freeze"" people are always talking about? or are we witnessing the impact of social media on our society? i know that the idea about ""kids and their iphones"" is a meme, but i have wondered if short form content like tiktok can really have such a negative impact on our ability to think. i have noticed that as a society we seem to be growing more and more apathetic regarding everything and it is really alarming when people don't even seem to care to actively learn and engage with the content they are learning in a major that they picked and applied to! after interacting with people around campus, i genuinely worry that our society is heading towards an idiocracy. do others share this concern? am i looking too much into it?",discussion

that being said, both the master of human-computer interaction and design (mhcid) and the m.s. in human-centered design & engineering (hcde) rank very highly and i plan to apply to hcde. though i want to make sure this school is worth it for me. 

wpi has decent academics, though i feel the vibes on campus are not the best, the people are very similar, and the school doesn't offer enough events that students are actually interested in.

"re: are you ""actively"" thinking in your daily life? i made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1877yl8/are_you_actively_thinking_in_your_daily_life/) a few days ago asking people if they are actively thinking in their daily lives. i received a variety of responses from people and upon reflection i do not think i was clear in what i was asking, which caused some people to question the sincerity of my post. 

obviously everyone ""thinks"" and people have thoughts going through their head constantly at varying rates. asking people if they are ""thinking"" was not the best way to start this discussion, and i can see how some people may have viewed that post in a negative light.

i have spent the last few weeks reflecting on my time at uw, and while i am grateful for the opportunities, connections, and friendships i have made here, i also have feelings of dissatisfaction. i got into a good program, which lead to good opportunities that i can pursue post-grad and i have made friends that i hope to stay in touch with into the future, but i feel as though i haven't developed as a person/adult as much as i would have liked during my time in college.

i expected going into a good university like uw that i would be able to engage with people that are passionate about a variety of topics, and can learn from their unique perspectives on the world. i feel as though i haven't really gotten to do any of that. granted, a significant portion of that time was during lock down, but we have been in person for couple of years now and after taking a variety of courses in person i can say that all of them have been pretty disappointing.

i think my disappointment is a result of a lack of engagement in any course. the discussion-based classes are difficult to get through as no one seems to want to engage in any of the content or participate in course dialogue. it becomes difficult to care about the content when it seems like none of your peers care at all. professors will ask questions to try to spark conversations and no one seems to want to answer unless they are specifically called on. when i try to cold approach people to discuss stuff in class i get one-word responses or just blank stares with ""i don't know"", followed by scrolling on their phone or laptop for the rest of the discussion. 

i have tried to join clubs to meet people who want to talk about literally any topic. this hasn't been easy since many of the clubs listed in the rso directory are abandoned. i was told this was because many officers graduated during the pandemic and no one was there to step into their roles. i have joined many dead discord servers for rsos and at this point i have kinda stopped even trying.

these experiences caused me to make my previous post, as i was curious if people are so preoccupied with their own stuff that they don't have the interest/energy to engage in anything beyond their own bubble, including course content. i understand that my last post was definitely worded poorly and i could have explained myself better, but i also know i am not the only one who has had these experiences after talking with some friends about this issue. 

maybe i am looking into in too much, but i genuinely feel like my time at college was kinda wasted. i don't feel any different leaving as i did coming in, which is upsetting. i hear about people who were able to grow as a person during their time in college and i am envious of their experience. i'm not talking about the ""eat, pray, love"" type of self discovery journey where i ""find myself"". i am merely saying that aside from the technical skills i have gained in some courses, i feel as though i haven't really learned anything from college. can anyone else relate to this? was college a waste of time and money or is this all that college is supposed to be? if so i feel as though i may have been better off at a coding boot camp rather than spending 4 years here.",discussion

my college doesn’t offer psych 202 or 209 either, but i’ve completed intro psych and developmental psych, i was registered for criminology next semester too but now i’m thinking i should change it to abnormal psych instead.",advice

"are mechanical engineering ph.d. programs funded here? i'm a senior in mechanical engineering at university of colorado boulder and i'm facing the stark reality that even when you're at a solid engineering school and have good engineering project experience, you still won't get jack shit for jobs if you don't have three internships like most of the other kids here. i'm looking at the bam program at my current school but thinking one more year won't be enough time to make a difference especially with the fact that i missed half of the internship posting season for summer 2024 already. which means i have to go back to school for another 5 or 6 years to get my ph.d, and i'd like to try somewhere new if i can get funding for it. i always thought you guys were my second out-of-state choice after cal, who it's too late to apply for anyway, but i can't find out whether ph.d. students are typically funded here as your website does not seem to provide this information. want to know before i spend $50 on an application fee (if i even have time to gather lors, and whatever else i'd need, before the deadline.) thank you!",admissions
"californian attending wsu interested in transferring here. i'm originally from california and transferred to wsu this fall after 3 years at community college. i was recommended to come here since my mother, sister and brother in law attended here. my major is computer engineering. my experience at wsu has been very unprofessional. not with my classes per say, but how i've been treated by the administration and staff as a california transfer. this has resulted me in seeking to transfer out, one of the schools i'm interested in being udub.

i've had a lot of problems getting classes transferred over here for credit, one of them i'm having to retake because wsu doesn't uphold the one from ca as their equal. i've had to submit plenty of course evaluation forms because wsu marked some of my classes (like linear algebra) as electives. the engineering counselors are lackluster. the university is also making me take a bunch of classes i never thought i would have to take, extending  my time here about 1-2 semesters (3 years here total), unless this is how it is for all transfer students at other universities. originally i intended to transfer to cal poly slo, so i completed all classes relative for transferring over there, and all california universities and community colleges are extremely tight, making it easy to transfer for in-state students (assist website).

i've had other huge problems, such as the residency living situation (they refused to move me out of a freshman dorm until a month and a half later, which i never prioritized on my application, and i'm 21 and applied for an upperclassman dorm). traveling around here is fairly restricted, with a bus transit system which isn't the best. you have moscow, idaho, 6 miles down the road but i have no personal vehicle. pullman is a very small town in the middle of nowhere dependent on the student life to keep it thriving. my family also owns a house in bremerton, and my sister and brother in law live in gig harbor, so i'd be closer to family. and frankly, i am not going to frats or partying as much as most people here (which is what this uni is known for) since i am a junior-level engineering major, where as the life at udub is more studious (or am i wrong? or is there a good social life as well?).

eventually, i will have to take higher level cs classes and the cs department here is extremely cutthroat, with terrible professors who are constantly leaving and wsu is bringing in international grad students to teach these classes. this seems to be a problem with wsu in general though, not just limited to the cs department since my diffy q class next semester has an international grad student teaching it. wsu seems to make very impulsive decisions, and lacks proper investment with their money. lots of places are run down around here and could use improvement, but instead they're dedicating 80 million dollars to a new engineering building which i think is outrageous and totally unnecessary with the one we have now.

i  did some research here and read that udub prioritizes transfer students who are not attending a 4 year institution. i'm wondering how that  would affect my chances in getting in here. the comp e program here is very similar to ee, so i would apply for the ece program at udub. my current gpa from transferring to wsu is 3.6, and i intend on getting a 3.7-4 gpa this semester. i'm also technically a wa resident, since i used my military background to get out of having to pay out-of-state tuition here at wsu and received a wa dl as a result.

can anyone give me advice who has been in a similar situation? also, how does udub compare to my experiences here at wsu with administration, the staff, treatment as a california out-of-state transfer, and getting credit for my classes?",advice

"disappointed with fish 340 / biol 340 experience - lorenz hauser - name and shame! as a junior, a poc, someone with financial struggles, and academically as someone who has taken very difficult classes, this ranks as one of the worst classes that i’ve taken at the uw and other students can agree with me. 

we had a very  challenging time in fish 340 / biol 340 under lorenz hauser's instruction, alongside tas bryan and marta. the course lacked organization, making it difficult to navigate. despite efforts to seek help, explanations often fell short. grading was not ideal across the board—receiving conflicting advice from tas and classmates online in feedbackfruits made it perplexing to discern what was needed for assignments. lab sessions were similarly confusing, with changing instructions creating difficulties in following along and performing experiments effectively. while the course material itself wasn't overly complex, the delivery and guidance were subpar, hindering the learning experience. there were instances during labs where seeking guidance resulted in no responses, “i can’t tell you the answer’ by the tas, leaving us feeling stranded rather than guided. the grading of exams seemed arbitrary, and the subjectivity of the graders left many of us anxious about our final grades. additionally, the use of chatgpt  by the tas during office hours, without solid expertise in genetics, added to the frustration. considering my experience, i'd suggest exploring alternative courses if possible. 

compilation student remarks: 

“grading was horrible in the class, they never told us what’s wrong. one ta would tell me that i wrote my discussion section fine and not to worry about it, while the other ta would tell me to rewrite the entire section (bryan mostly, with marta being the lenient grader, but this went back and forth depending on what i showed them on my laptop.) this experience was repeated during multiple office hours, with the tas giving me one piece of advice, the professor, and the somewhat terrible advice that students would give each other because things were graded on feedback fruits.”

“like for the first couple of labs as well—they were changing numbers during our session and it made things confusing for me to process, because like im listening tot them change instructions, then having to write it down, then i am needing to actually perform the experiment.”

“while the content itself wasn’t super challenging their instruction and way of delivering it made things very challenging.”

“during some of the labs, bryan would tell us that ‘he can’t give us the answer’ all we are doing is asking for some guidance and you’re replying with that… most likely they didn’t know the answers themselves either.”

“exams are also graded brutally, and we are all worried for our grade in the class after this final. we don’t know how it will be graded because the graders are very subjective. they want the answers in their own words and find an opportunity to take off points for everything. if they want us to practice critical thinking in this class then maybe they should practice what they preach.“ 

“they were not  knowledgable themselves, i realized this after attending their office hours, they use chatgpt to answer the questions and really need to take a course on genetics before teaching it. they are on the whole very poor teachers.“ 

“advice: if it’s not a requirement, take another class if you can. worst genetics class that i’ve taken as an oceanography major and my friends in biology feel the same. take genome 361 if you need the requirement!” ",academics

"is it still super hard to get into the cse major now? (presumably, because the faculty are taking in mostly direct admits) i wanna go to a tech company but i am not a direct admit, what are my options? hi, everyone. i hear this a lot throughout any resource i use to know more about uw: it is hard as hell to transfer to cse in uw from a pre-major(eg. pre-science). 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

if you think this post is long, please just read the paragraph after 'overall'!!!

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

when i first got admitted at uw, i was thinking of getting most pre-requisite courses such as cse, math, and physics from an outside institution which may have a relatively generous grading system(i know these pre-requisites are all weed-out courses, so the grading at uw will be very tough). and next, i will try really hard on the remaining 2-3 pre-requisites(such as if i need to take cse 121, 122, 123, i will take 121,122 at an outside institution where the grading could be easier first so if cse 123 really gets tough, at least my average grade will not be affected too much).

will this work for me to get into the cse major or something related to cs? at least if i try really hard, a gpa of 3.7-3.9 is achievable through this method. to take all the weed-out courses only at uw and maintain a gpa like this would be much harder. so will this method work out?

&#x200b;

\###but here is the thing, if getting into cse major would mean a 4.0 gpa + a very good essay, it is very hard but doable. but is it like now a 4.0 gpa and a well-written essay will still be pretty far from enough to get into the cse major? if that is the thing, there are only two option for me:

first is to get into a major less competitive such as applied math-data science option. but the issue is that i wanna get into a tech company. if the market gets warmer and the hiring freeze starts to cease to a degree, will this land me a job anyway or i have to get a computing degree however the current it market is? can i get a good tech job with a applied math degree from uw(i know this is not the only factor to get a job, but lets just compare them)? will this be very different from a cse degree?

&#x200b;

overall, is it now almost impossible to get into the cse major if not being a direct admit? can i get a good substitution for cse at uw such as what i mentioned, applied math? if none of these will actually work, i may start to double-think about getting my degree here because all i am pursuing right now is to get a cs job after i graduate.

i completely understand just wanting to feel a little certainty, and i remember how anxious waiting for a decision can be. but the truth is that none of us are able to read your gpa and sat off a reddit post and then accurately tell you whether you’ll be admitted or not. the admissions criteria is holistic and often pretty unclear, and even if you think you have no shot, it can’t hurt to apply and see.

"is math 126 possible without ""fully completing"" math 125? good morning,  


i was thinking about taking math 126 spring quarter. the problem is, i never ""fully completed"" math 125 however i do have credit for it. at my high school, our ap calc ab class had an option to take chs credit instead of the ap test. since i planned on attending a school instate, i opted for the chs credits and transferred them here. for the class, **i got credit for both math 124 & 125**, however in terms of curriculum, we probably made it halfway through 125 (or maybe even less).  


in my current position, is it a bad idea to take math 126? for the record i am a first year student and i have not taken a math class since i graduated high school in 2023. i plan on majoring in informatics, and i will be applying this spring. i already have all of my info pre-reqs complete so now i plan on working on pre-reqs for potential backup majors (like statistics).

here are the options i have thought about but i'm not sure any of them are a good idea.  


* my advisor said that i can retake math 125 to refresh on the course content, however this could be a waste because i already have the credit. (also i have been told that this is risky because if i do poorly, i could have both 125 and 126 ruining my gpa)
* my advisor also suggested that i can just take the class now and spend a lot of time at the instructional center because i'm an omad student.
* my advisor also mentioned that if i'm confident in my info application, i should just wait to see if i'm rejected before thinking about pre-reqs for other majors. in this case, he was suggesting i wait until fall. then if i get into info on my first try, i don't have to worry about taking 126.
* i have also thought about taking the course over the summer at somewhere like edmonds cc, and just transferring it in.  


so i guess my question would be, which out of those options is the best? or is there another option that's better that i don't have listed?

"list of tools and apps that make your student life easier. as a graduate, i realized there are many smart ways i should have utilized during my time in school to enhance productivity. i've come to understand that numerous tools exist that significantly simplify student life. allow me to share a few tools here that can aid you (especially freshmen and sophomores) in navigating your student life.

notion and timetable: these are essential tools for organizing your life. if you spend enough time scrolling through tiktok (i know you do), and you're unaware of these tools, you've been living under a rock. utilize these tools and search for tutorials on youtube about how to effectively use them as a student.

remnote: another must-have tool. this application employs common study methods to enhance your studying experience. it assists in creating flashcards and applying evidence-based memory techniques. don't just take my word for it—look it up on youtube; you won't regret it.

insight trunk newsletter: ever feel left out when conversing with friends who seem to know everything? look up this newsletter on google and make it a habit to read. they provide 10-minute reads on various topics that you can peruse on the bus, during breakfast, or before sleeping. two years from now, you'll become the smartest person in your friend group.

myfitnesspal: now, let's move on to health. first up is myfitnesspal, which helps you track your caloric intake. simply use this app to scan whatever you purchase, and you'll know how many calories you're consuming. it's an excellent choice for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

fitbod: this one is optional. if money isn't an issue and you can afford a personal trainer, that's fantastic! if not, fitbod is a more affordable alternative. it tailors a fitness program based on your weight, height, age, and other factors.

classpass: another important aspect of student life is socializing. while classes should be your priority, this app helps you join multiple local fitness classes. instead of sticking to one place, you now have the opportunity to explore various classes, increasing your chances of meeting new people who share your hobbies.

isavemoney: this is a budgeting app, but honestly, any budgeting app will work. this one is my personal choice.",student life

"a very gentle reminder about lecture seating  before i begin, let the record show i do not think this is a big, devastating deal. it is just a slight awkward inconvenience. 

i’m left handed, and whenever there are exams in lecture halls without assigned seats, i am reminded that many people do not process that left side aisle seats have left handed desks. people seem to favor aisle seats so if i don’t get there right away, all the leftie desks are filled. during lectures, most people use laptops for notes so it’s not an issue, but with exams it’s ever so slightly annoying. my options are to either have an unnecessarily awkward writing position for the exam, or to have to ask someone “are you left handed?” and ask them to move when they say no fwhich in my experience, they always do). i wouldn’t be as bothered if the two outcomes weren’t always a) the person seeming awkward and embarrassed or b) the person looking at me like i just spoke an alien language.

after looking around for resources on practicing technical interviews, i could only come up with youtube videos of mock interviews and websites where you have to pay hundreds of dollars to practice one technical interview. not all of us (myself included) have the money to spare on these sites, and personally i prefer practicing for real rather than watching someone else in a mock interview. 

&#x200b;

this has led me to start work on a proposal to the allen school on a way to allow students to practice in a no-cost, risk-free environment with people who have experience conducting technical interviews.

let me know if this is something you would be interested in, as well as any suggestions or concerns you may have. anything helps! hopefully i'll be able to use the feedback from this as part of my proposal :)",discussion
"do you guys actually learn/retain anything on the quarter system? i feel like everyone just pretends to have it together lol. do you all actually retain anything from the pace of your classes or do you just find yourself in a constant state of exam prep? i'm reviewing for a final right now and it requires you to recall stuff from the midterm i just took 3 weeks ago and i could not tell you how to do any of this. i know i have a particularly bad memory and my add is pretty bad but i cant be the only one. everything on my resume is just stuff i forgot how to do from lack of practice. it can be frustrating when i have slaved away at all this stuff just to have limited employability.

i have did not submit my sat scores, not sure if that hinders my decision. i have 7 extracurriculars such as president of key club for two years, member of fbla and honors society, i tutored my junior year and did varsity cheerleading while coaching on the side. i got a job the second i turned 16 and have a pretty good essay from what people have told me.

"what are my chances of getting admitted? i am an in state student with a 3.1 gpa. no sat/act. both of my parents have a graduate degree from uw. i took challenging ap classes in my 11th and 12th grade year, including engl 101 comp (college cred class) where i earned a b+. i go to the #1 feeder school for uw in my state.

my extra curriculars: 4 years of varsity basketball & track, where i was captain for both sports during 2 of the years. aau circuit basketball for 4 years. music studio internship. i worked at a construction company. i worked at a restaurant. i volunteered. and i did a foreign exchange program in costa rica.

i am very confident in my personal statement because of the high grade i earned on my personal statement assignment from my engl 101 teacher who is notorious for being a very harsh grader. i got one of the best scores in my school.

i explained in the additional essay that the reason why my gpa is so low, is because i failed 4 classes in the second semester of 10th grade. this was due to my father passing away, and my brother being sent to a psychiatric ward for schizophrenia due to him being very violent.

on top of this, when i came back to school in 11th grade, i earned straight a’s in all of my classes. and prior to second semester of 10th grade, i was a a/ high b student.

"psa for admitted first years about majors congratulations all incoming huskies! 

every year there is some confusion about majors and applying to uw, and i’m seeing some of that here, so i hope this can clear some things up.

when you applied for uw and selected your intended major, if you are admitted that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re actually in the major. only a select number of majors have the potential for incoming first years to be directly admitted, and those are listed at the attached link. most majors at uw do not allow for direct admit, so if you selected any of those majors on your application as your intended major and were admitted, you were admitted to uw as major undeclared, and may be noted as “pre-major”, “pre-sciences”, “pre-health”, or “pre-art” in your portal, all of these mean you don’t have a major.

psychology for example does not have direct admit, so if you selected psychology and were admitted, you are not actually in the psychology major. you would need to look up psychology’s pre-requisites, complete those courses, and apply once you’re here. some majors are selective and competitive to get into, some only have minimum requirements that as long as you complete those you’re admitted, and some majors are open, meaning there are no pre-reqs and you can declare at any time.

please just be aware during your planning for your first year that there are some steps you may need to take in order to actually get into your major, and plan to take those pre-reqs as soon as possible. uw is different than other schools that will typically admit you into your major when you’re admitted to the school, but uw more often than not will admit only to the school and not directly to any major. 

i hope this clears some things up!

"should i contact admissions? recently i got accepted into uw computer science. however, im a little worried about my course schedule. when i applied to uw, i mentioned i would take econ and accounting (along with math, physics, etc.). im running start, so i said i would take econ 201, 202, accounting 201, 202, 203. in the spring, winter, and possibly summer quarters. however, when i took accounting this past winter quarter, i realized that business is not something i wanted to pursue, and i don't want to take them. however, this world be a discrepancy in what i said and what i did. also i had to drop out of accounting this winter (gpa dd not get affected but did show as a w in the transcript) due to family concerns.

to off set this i will try to be taking more math classes and data science classes as that is what i want to pursue later on in college as well.

so i was just wondering if i should contact admissions about this? i got in for cs, so im not too worried, but i want to play it safe than sorry. if i should, what should i say?

"what does it take to get an application rescinded? i'm aware its on a case by case basis but i'm genuinely really worried and need some advice.

not to trauma dump, but for a fuller a picture, in my junior year my dad died which messed up my grades quite a bit. i am a running start student and from what i remember i got one n/c, one d, and one c-. the rest were a's and b's. gpa dropped from 4.0 to i believe a 3.6. 

with those grades i still somehow managed to get accepted for marine bio for the 2024 autumn quarter. 

with that this year has been equally a struggle (due to some extra family issues that were caused from my dads passing) i got two c's fall quarter and i believe i will either be getting a d or an n/c (depending on which i decide to take) and a b for winter quarter. my gpa, without winter quarters grades, is currently a 3.4. 

i have reason to believe that the rest of this year i will get a's and b's as all i'm really taking next quarter are pe classes because that's i still need for grad credits. 

i've talked to my therapist and she says she'll write a letter explaining my current situation which we have reason to believe will improve considerably after i move to college. 

i am fully aware that i messed up big and this is fully on me, no excuses. i know that i will probably get a letter asking what happened. what i really want to know is what has it taken for people to get rescinded in the past and how screwed am i really? i know there will be no guarantees but i just want some form of confirmation on my chances.

yet i see this intense fascination with the lesser ranked ivies and non-ivies. are these folks mere brand name chasers who want bragging rights personally and/or have been condition to think that way by their helicopter parents, or am i missing something else. so they not know about the cs ranking? have they just given up on udub as out of staters given its heavy presence for instaters? i could see the argument that this high up in the rankings, the specific order doesn’t matter as much, and all else being equal maybe a brand could open some doors. thoughts?",discussion

which one would be better for business and university experience wise?

"ucsb vs uw seattle i am stuck between ucsb vs uw seattle. i got into ucsb for pre-economics & accounting, and uw seattle as a direct admit to the foster school of business. i am a california resident but cost isn't that much of an issue.

**school: ucsb vs uw**

us news rank: 35 vs 40

acceptance rate: 29% vs 46%

total cost per year: 40k vs 60k (oos)

location: beach town vs big city

student-faculty ratio: 17:1 vs 21:1

overall, ucsb appears better in every meaningful statistic, however, the specific program is what i am more curious about. in 2023, uw foster's starting salary for undergrads was 76.6k in 2023 with a 94% placement after 3 months, and the average signing bonus was 8.5k. this makes it significantly better than uw overall.

on the other hand, ucsb pre-economics & accounting major has very little data available online and feels like a bit more of a gamble. does anyone have any data on ucsb accounting major? i am leaning towards foster since their mba is ranked 20th on us news (which is still relevant to the undergraduate program) and since i have concrete data on outcomes. some data on ucsb's accounting/econ program and any possible first-hand experience would be super helpful before making a decision.

extra: i have also been waitlisted by michigan and ucsd and was wondering how they would stack up in case i am offered a spot. i am also considering getting an mba in the future and am not sure how that would impact my decision, i am assuming it won't but not i am not sure what mba admissions are like.",admissions

"math credit waived for taking higher level class? i’m in a really dumb situation that i put myself in and i so desperately need guidance or advice. i had math 125/126 credit from running start, and throughout college i took math 207/207/224 for my degree. note …. i did not have math 124 credit because of some technicalities. i (stupidly) assumed that eventually i could get it waived somehow, so i put off even dealing with the credit until now as a senior.

last quarter i went to my advisors and asked for waiver, and while they seemed somewhat hopeful that it would get waived they eventually got back to me and informed me that it isn’t able to be waived. and not only that, i’m not eligible to take the course for credit at uw because the math department has a rule about taking a lower-level class for credit … so my only option would have been to take it at a community college or to take a higher level course (either math 209, or upper level amath course, etc) for substitution. i tried looking into a local community college but that would have been ~$1000 i would have had to pay out of pocket for, which i can’t afford, so i tried sucking it up and taking one of the amath courses this quarter.

it’s just not going well for me. the course is so difficult and beyond my understanding or interest. i go to class, and i review the notes but a single problem takes me 1-2 hours just to create a gameplan and understand what to do. my professor’s office hours was full with almost a third of the class there too, and others have made comments about our first homework’s difficulty. i’m also just going through so much in life right now, like i just broke up with my long-term partner of 4 years and now i have to go through the process of moving back home. other stuff also going on in my life but honestly the breakup is the one hitting pretty hard. 

i thought i could just deal with this but to be honest i can’t. this is really difficult for me. maybe i’m being entitled but i was shocked that the solution was to take a significantly higher-level course for credit that i otherwise wouldn’t have been expected to take. 

has anyone ever been in a situation like this before? does anyone have advice? i was thinking of going to the math department’s advising hours tomorrow and asking them directly for help since i haven’t done that yet. i knownit’s such a dumb situation i did to myself, and i need to deal with the consequences, but i’m feeling so hopeless because i don’t think i can do this.",advice

how is amath 301? is it okay to go into it with just math 125 background? what are some tips or pointers you would give to students who would like to take it? are there any resources you would point them towards to be able to do really well in the class? thanks in advance!",advice
"transferring to uw seattle from 4 year (umich)? hey all,

i’m a freshman and international student currently in umich and i do not really like the environment, culture and people here that much and even the cs department here is a little weird. overall i don’t feel happy or academically fulfilled here.

after some research i am super motivated in transferring to uw seattle because of location, better connections and stronger cs program and the transfer acceptance rate is not as low as other prestigious universities. i am also a cs and stats double major.

i currently have a 3.72 gpa. i know my chances at uw cs are altar super low so i don’t how hopeful be because i really want to transfer out of umich and into uw and i am willing to try my absolute best to stand out. should i also apply for stats or math major for higher chances? 

please can you give some words of advice so i can succeed when i apply for transfer during sophomore year? i am motivated and willing to do my absolute best.

"uw seattle transfer rate hello. i am an international student from canada currently committed to uc irvine for their school of computing (wanted to go to us for better job opportunities). however, i have a small feeling that i might get homesick and want to transfer to a school nearer to my home (4 hour train to vancouver). in this case, how hard is it to transfer into uws computer science school? i couldnt find any stats online, so was wondering if anyone on the subreddit knew of people who transferred in the cs school from an already established institution.

"major change hey everyone!
i applied for this admission cycle and was directly admitted to chemistry in the college of arts and sciences. given the relatively early deadline of uw, i was not completely sure of my major at the time although i was sure it was going to be either chemistry or chemical engineering. so i applied as a chemistry major without giving it much thought, but i decided i was going to pursue engineering a while after i applied to uw. now that i am accepted and uw actually it’s one of my top choices, i realize that i should’ve applied as an engineering major if i wanted to pursue cheme. hence my questions are, can direct admits change their major after enrolling? if so, how difficult would be for me to change my major from chemistry to cheme? and how competitive is it to get directly admitted to chemistry? i am an international student, if it’s a factor.
thanks in advance!",academics
"why do residency halls cost more than off-campus alternatives? as a future uw seattle student, i'm trying to understand the reasoning behind the high costs of on-campus residence halls compared to off-campus housing options. it seems that many off-campus apartments are more spacious, offer more privacy, and should be more comfortable than the typical dorm room.

are there specific benefits or extra amenities included in the residence hall fees that justify the high costs? i feel like i'm missing something in the logic behind the pricing, so i'd appreciate if someone could explain the rationale.

"experience with classics major at uw? i'll be completely honest in that i wasn't the smartest planner when i took community college classes to get my aa degree whilst in high school and rarely took classes that i had checked would transfer well as prerequisites for my intended majors: psychology and english. so when i was done with cc, i looked and realized i could only apply to get a degree that had no prerequisites. even english had a long list of prerequisite classes i had never taken. i'm pretty stupid for not preparing. i also don't intend to waste more money on taking those prerequisites at the cc, i am not in the financial position to do that and then wait another year for admission at uw. 

for a little context i will be a lawyer, and i just knew i would take a major that was focused in humanities and arts and then head out to law school. so i chose classics(as a transfer) and will start this year. 

so now i'm curious on what to expect for this major. i love history and reading so i'm not worried i won't like it, but i wonder, what type of people take these classes? it was clearly not my intended major and i don't know anyone that's taken a major like this, it's even more ""out there"" than philosophy. 

i know i sound ignorant asking ""who takes this major"" really i just want to hear if some of you have had great experiences with this major. i'm fresh out of high school by the way. ",discussion

what do classes in pre-sciences entail? are they just preliminary courses that give me a better baseline for applying to a major like neuroscience or even biology?

"the bakery, thoughts? my freshman year there were so many more houses that hosted shows and i used to really enjoy going to them. but, now it seems like the bakery is really the only one and so many people go. i find it so stressful and can't help but worry something bad might happen.  

also, i personally feel like the vibes of shows has changed. they use to all be about inclusivity and being yourself and i use to have a lot of fun at them and enjoyed talking to people, but i feel like the last couple times i've gone to the bakery i have felt very unwelcomed and like no one wants to talk to me. one clear thing i have noticed is people dress up way more for the shows, i feel like i can't just wear what i wore to class that day anymore. i have to put on some elaborate trend setting outfit with cool eyeliner just for people to not cut me i the bathroom line. i understand self expression, but its gotten to a point where it feels like i have to perform and present a certain way just to attend. honestly it feels like i'm back in high school except in high school i was too queer for the cool kids and now i feel like i don't present queer enough, but now all the cool kids are bi in a het relationship and don't like the word lesbian because it ""sounds too harsh"".

i haven't attended one in a while though, is this still the vibe? does it still get packed? and idk maybe because it 420 and there's no theme it might not be as intense.  my friends and i are thinking or going, but also seriously not because this is an experience we've all felt. have people had good experiences there as of lately? what type of people have been attending? part of me also thinks maybe its because i am not a freshman anymore, i know non freshman go, but i also know alot of freshman do attend and maybe only want to talk to other freshman. who knows, and maybe what i am saying is a hot take.
