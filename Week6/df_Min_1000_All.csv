"tell me what you want from remote teaching? throwaway account, because i don't want to reveal my identity.

let's  say someone has some (limited) influence over the way some of your  teachers teach on zoom, canvas, twitch, or whatever system they use.  what would you tell them?

what do you want from remote teaching? what do you want teachers to know? what best practices do you see?

i'll  state up front i know this is asking you to do work to help the people  you're paying to do work to teach you, but i also see students having  way too little voice in this process, and want to change that where i  can.",discussion

"state of the sub/mod update hello huskies,

first of all i would like to apologize for all the confusion that's been had these past few days/months/years. we (the mods) have not been super active or communicative in this sub, and we've let things get out of control. i'm sorry about that. going forward this will not be the case.

fortunately, we've finally been able to get in touch with bamitup, and he has granted me additional content management permissions. i can now see all of the automod settings and the full moderation queue.

just to clear up any confusion:

1. posts or comments by accounts with negative comment karma are automatically removed.
2. posts or comments by accounts that are less than 3 days old are automatically removed.
3. posts or comments that are reported many times are automatically removed and are to be manually reviewed by the mods.

to be clear: we are not removing comments that are critical of uw staff. we are not trying to silence your opinions. there is no grand conspiracy of uw staff infiltrating the sub (at least that i am aware of). we were just unclear about what kind of content was being auto removed.

going forward, we're definitely going to need more mods. i currently **do not** have the ability to add mods, so i will contact bam about that. i don't know how many mods we need or who they should be (i've had some people pm me about it), so i think it would be a good idea if we had an open discussion about it here. i personally think the team should be made up of active students, but let's discuss.

finally, i've been getting intermittent pms about people who have been auto banned in the past. if you think you've been unjustly banned by automod, please pm me and i will look into it. i can't unban you directly but i'll have one of the other mods do it.

again i apologize for the issues here. we will right this ship. thanks.",discussion

"revised study advice **foreword:**

because some people have contacted me privately and legitimately thought my advice was helpful i am putting a toned down version here. i will elaborate more in the comment section.


**grading system:**

for curved classes, the median grade will be fixed to a certain gpa. for most weed out courses this will be in the 2.8 to 3.1 range. in a class of 200 about 4-6 people will receive a 4.0, 6-8 a 3.9, and so on up to about 20-25 receiving a gpa in the 3.5 range. this means to get a 3.5+ gpa you will need to be in the top 30% of your class.


**maintaining focus:**

a common complaint is that students are spending lots of time studying but with no payoff. when you study you will need to achieve a point of focus. put away your distractions and stay put at a desk and when you take a break only do it to use the restroom or take a quick bite. refrain from doing activities that have the potential to distract you. i personally recommend staying at a desk for 4 hours at a time. two 2 hours sessions without getting up with a break in between should work as well. at first you will feel bored and will not be able to concentrate. that is normal. push through it, and eventually you will be able to ""zone out"" and study effectively.


**in regards to lectures, textbooks, and videos:**

for the weed out classes i personally think the textbook is all you really need. yes learning form a textbook can be hard and confusing that is all part of the process. as things become more complex, your textbook is going to become your main source of information so i think getting used to it is going to be of great benefit. as for lectures there's really no point in showing up unless you are going to actively follow along and take notes (preferably handwritten). and finally, i think people should use youtube videos cautiously as they can be a time consuming and passive way to learn that works out to be not as effective long term.


**what to study:**

a lot of people think that studying consists of reviewing notes and reading the textbook. while this is a good way to start, it really only gives a lay of the land. you will need to do what is called active learning in order to be able to tackle the wide range of problems professors will throw at you. i recommend forming a study group with regular meeting times so that everyone is held accountable. each person should create problems in the form of a scenario that uses a concept from the class. refrain from asking simple things like ""what is x"", but rather aim for ""something y is being affected by object z, why is that?"". the process of forming questions and discussing the answer with others i found to be highly effective.",academics

"really could use some student input on if i should attend i'm currently a california senior trying to decide between here and university of wisconsin. initially, i was all on board with the idea of udub, but after looking into it, it seems like there's a toxic environment.

i'm admitted as dtc for engineering, so while i won't have to worry about getting into engineering, i still don't have a specific major. this is one of my biggest concerns. i keep hearing things about how competitive and cutthroat the students can be because everyone wants to get into their major. on top of that students apparently need to create an entire application, personal statement and all, just to apply for a major.

as for the social scene. i keep hearing that people are distant. something about a 'seattle freeze' and that it isn't really the easiest to meet a lot of people at school. additionally i hear that parties are few and far between if you're not in the greek system. does the school's reputation  as a commuter school really ring true?

overall i was just really hoping to hear some students' responses to some of these things. i really like the idea of being in seattle, having access to all these great companies in the area, and i love the idea of staying on the west coast. however, i don't want an atmosphere where people only have time to study and are constantly stressed.",discussion

"should i stay at uw (neuro) i'm currently a sophomore (soon to be junior) majoring in biology, and i recently got accepted to ucsd as a transfer majoring in neurobiology. i also plan to minor in applied math (have taken 301 and am planning on taking 3 more classes), and chemistry (if possible). currently i have a 3.5 overall gpa, with a 3.3 average across the bio series, so i think my chances at the neuroscience major are somewhat slim. however, i have had a year's worth of research experience in a neuroscience lab, and i've been involved in some neuroscience related clubs for quite a while (i'm also president of a non-neuro/bio rso). is it worth staying at uw, considering i probably won't get into the neuroscience major? how much does the major (biology vs. neuroscience) matter for graduate school (what i'm leaning towards) and/or medical school (something i'm considering but am not entirely sure of)? i'd like to do something with neuroscience in graduate school, so that might be important.   


currently the factors that are keeping me staying are: i have leadership positions at uw, uw has better/more neuroscience related clubs for undergrads, i have another lab lined up at uw that's very undergrad friendly/good for my transition into independent research, i can have minor(s) at uw, and uw might be better for my gpa because i can take less classes/have a less intense schedule.   


the factors encouraging me to transfer are: tuition (i'm a ca resident), weather, major (neurobiology vs biology), and the fact that ucsd is super good for neuro.  


considering everything, is it worth staying? what would you do, or if you've been in this situation, what did you do?

how hard is it to get into electrical engineering as dtc? i have a 3.25 major gpa and i'm wondering if i have a chance,admissions
"continuing in electrical engineering i'm currently finishing up my first year in ee (sophomore) and only my first ee class with ee 215. however, i'm really not enjoying this class as much as i thought i would. in fact, this class alone is making me reconsider this major and now i'm looking into applying for other majors. 122 was interesting but i'm not sure what it is with 215, possibly because it's online this quarter, but it just feels repetitive, like i'm repeating long and boring calculations over and over.

now that registration is right around the corner, i started looking at the schedule my advisor suggest i take (ee 233, ee 235, ee 393), but all the professors have terrible rmp ratings, times are really messed up, and they just seem to be extensions of ee 215, which i'm not enjoying.

so i guess my question is, does this get any better? i'm planning to go into embedded if i'm not able to switch out, but i'm not sure what i'll actually be doing in embedded and how many hardware classes i'll actually have to take? if there are any ee majors that could provide some insight or motivation to keep going, that would be really helpful!

"i'm a graduating senior with a sense of dread, alumni and peers, any advice? this is half venting, and half asking for advice. i know that everything that can be advised is largely dependent on me as the individual, so broad advice and tips is perfectly fine!

i do have long term goals of going to law school, but that's not until fall '21. i have a year until then. the job i had lined up is, unfortunately gone due to covid-related reasons and won't be returned for me. losing the structure of school and the ability to transition into my career feels...off. i kind of feel like i'm behind, and the last thing i want is to fall behind in life, which i know is much more fatalist than it really is.

it's hard to feel motivated or excited for graduation though, and if anything i'm imposed by a feeling of dread and anxiety for life beyond. 

anyone else feeling the same? any advice on how to not lose it or feel like trash or make use of my time other than just constantly applying for jobs that don't exist?

"from cheating in cse 143 to a full time programming role **as i am seeing that many admission decisions are coming out i thought now would be a good time to share the (success) story of my journey at uw, which is coming to an end this quarter.**

  
like many hopefuls i came into the uw hoping to do computer science. i had built my own computer in high school, i thought coding was fascinating, i saw that it was a field that was employable and paid well. like many up until i started at uw i didn't really realize the work it took to be successful, and i wasn't prepared for the competitive nature that uw cultivates. 

by the end of **my first year** i knew i would never be a cs student. i took cse 143 that winter with my roommate, we were both struggling on an assignment and he sent me an ""example"" of a past quarter's submission found online. as i soon found out, you can change every single variable name and you will still get caught. the program they run is able to see the structure of the code and compares it to their database of submissions. that crushed me, and was one of the hardest lessons i had to learn my freshman year. having to own up to my own mistake and look past it shook my world for the better. we both got caught and i don't blame my roommate at all.

i was able to finish the prerequisite courses to informatics just in time to apply my freshman year. i wrote a piss-poor essay which i was revising with 10 minutes left to the deadline. in retrospect of course i'm not surprised at all that i wasn't admitted, but at the time i was still partially in the mindset that life would just work out for me. 

after getting rejected my **sophomore year** with an actually well written and revised essay i was heartbroken. in my head i still was set on info as my backup major and didn't have another backup, i didn't have the prerequisites or grades for acms or any math heavy major. a friend of mine had recommended gis in geography as a tech-related alternative and by the end of the year i was a declared geography major. i still wanted to program for a living and still was hoping to get into info my junior year. i had it calculated that i could take info classes on the side and still graduate in 4 years if i was admitted then.

so many students i see on this sub-reddit put an incredible emphasis on getting into their major. which is a great goal to work towards, but it isn't the ""end all be all""! i finally came to realize around this point that *my major wasn't what was going to get me that desired job after college, it was the skills was able to gain and retain from my studies*. this was when i got my first internship paying minimum wage at a research center downtown to help add data visualizations to their website. i got this through applying to nearly every data science related *undergraduate research program listing.*

for my **junior year** informatics essay i was actually so ticked at the system that my essay was about how my major and grades don't define my capabilities in life. haha! long story short i didn't get in then either, and was officially going to be graduating as a geography major. i continued to take informatics and the non-major cse courses that i was able to get into and began applying like crazy to internship roles for the next summer. i likely *applied to over 100 roles mostly on sites like glassdoor*. i got my second internship at a recreational equipment company working on their employee management system/database. around this time i also secured a part-time engineering internship at a telecommunications giant that would go throughout my senior school year. when i applied and accepted these internships my resume still had informatics as my intended major even though i was denied from the program a few weeks afterwards. 

this might apply to tech more than other majors but *don't think that because you didn't get into your major you aren't qualified or able to get that role you want or be successful in the future*. fight through it and apply everywhere! **work experience is so much more valuable than any major title or course.** 

the geography major is not incredibly technical and even though i'm seeing this data science option that has been recently added to it, after looking at the courses, it's not that much more intensive. geography courses all hold your hand through the material and if you do major in i highly recommend going above and beyond. i was able to take every single non-major cse course except for ai and the photography one. in informatics i was able to get the android, ios, and server-side courses (don't take professionalism), many people assumed i was in the major.

for a while i regretted not transferring when the geography major initially disappointed me, but in retrospect two factors made staying worth it, the reduced in-state tuition (probably saved over $50,000 in debt), and simply *the amount of opportunities in seattle*. all my internships were located in seattle and being able to be at school so close gave me the opportunities to go to interviews (of which i got rejected from many) and eventually find internships. 

this summer i start work full time as a diagnostics engineer writing programs that monitor and help to maintain cell phone service around the country, i get to work with massive amounts of data, and am making a 6 figure salary right out of college. to everyone who has been rejected from any major, know that it isn't the end of the world and you can and will bounce back. stay positive and fail forward.",advice

"""easy 4.0"" classes review - winter and spring 2020 i was thinking this would help you all with future class registrations. this school year i took a few of the suggested easy classes on our megathreads and i'm here to provide an updated review. this includes psych 101, ais 103, ais 270, and drama 215.  


**winter 2020:**  


**• (i&s, 5 cr) psych 101 w/ judith l. mclaughlin:** honestly, i loved every second of this class. mclaughlin is so sweet. she was always open to scheduling meetings outside of office hours if there was a time conflict with my classes. the tas also had office hours. in terms of grading, she graded based off of 3 online assignments (for completion), poll everywhere in-class questions (for completion), and 4 non-cumulative multiple-choice exams. i was also able to raise my grade up to a maximum of 0.3 gpa points by participating in psychology studies outside of class (as the test subject). for the workload, i spent around 2 hours studying and reviewing notes everyday and got a 4.0. i didn't find it necessary to read everything in the textbook; she provided a study guide for us to focus on specific concepts and sections. her exam questions gave a scenario and we needed to match it to a concept we learned in class. given this, we didn't need to do that much rote memorization since she gave similar scenarios in her lectures. unfortunately, i never fully paid attention (my own fault) so i just made quizlet sets to remember the concepts. you can find them here if you want to get a feel for the content: [https://quizlet.com/kpolful](https://quizlet.com/kpolful)  


overall, i wouldn't call it an ""easy 4.0"" since you need to put a good amount of effort in every week to get one. for perspective, she revealed the score spread after every test and only 30-40% of the class consistently got above 90%. however, it's definitely an easy 3.5+.  


**• (i&s & div, 5 cr) ais 103 w/ dian million:** imagine the coolest aunt you could ever ask for. that's dian. lectures consisted of dian telling stories about her inspiring indigenous origin and watching films. our work consisted of four ""quizzes"" that each had around 5 long answer questions (250-500 words each). they're based on 3-20 page readings she posts to canvas. why quizzes is in quotation marks is because we had 2 weeks to answer them. there was also an assignment for us to go to burke to research indigenous artifacts and a final art project to convey our emotions for a topic we learned during the quarter (graded on completion).  


""easy 4.0"" approved. although she's not teaching for fall quarter 2020, i'm sure any introductory ais class will be similar in workload.  


**spring 2020 (keep in mind the online format may have significantly affected the workload):**  


**• (i&s & div, 5 cr) ais 270 w/ charlotte cote:** imagine your other coolest aunt. that's charlotte. our work consists of interacting with two discussion boards and a final quiz. charlotte explicitly said she was planning on assigning two quizzes but kept it to one because of how much stress we're going through. bless her soul. in the discussion boards you have to write an answer to questions related to the lectures and readings (similar to ais 103) in around 500-600 words total. after that, you post a question and respond to three other classmates. we're getting an entire week to work on the final quiz so i assume it's also long answer.  


""easy 4.0"" approved (online)  


**• (vlpa, 5 cr) drama 215 w/ skip mercier:** this was never mentioned, but somebody should add this to the list of easy 4.0s. skip is passionate about set/costume design and always strives to pass on that passion to his students. did you know he worked on plays for alice in wonderland and finding nemo? seriously, cool guy. it seems this class is fairly new and shows up every spring quarter. every week we have a few assignments (1-3) that have us test and improve our skills with a new concept of theater design. some examples include drawing a building with the use of perspective and drawing our own rube goldberg machine. there's also a final group project. it's all graded on completion so...

"an unpopular opinion i would actually prefer fall quarter to be completely online.

yes, i'm fricking sick of staying home, and yes, i'm sick of zoom. i have zero motivation and am depressed most days because of this global pandemic. but that's very minuscule compared to people's health and seeing loved ones with family, die. i don't think i'd feel safe to go back to a university, with 20,000+ people in the usa alone diagnosed with covid-19 daily right now. i'm sure this number would decrease by september, but i doubt this whole thing will be over. with that being said, i would feel very uncomfortable, even with social distancing (we all know there will be some people who don't comply) and mask usage (not everyone will wear masks, obviously). we wouldn't know who has the virus because covid can stay asymptomatic for 2 weeks, we don't know whether the doorknob we touch or the desk we lean against has virus germs on it. students live with grandparents or people who are more vulnerable to covid-19. commuting students also take public transportation systems that are used by a lot of people. people's safety and human lives are so, so much more important than some attendance points.

i know seattle is slowly flattening the curve. even though we were the state that had the first covid-19 patient back in january, i really do believe we are handling it very well and at a quicker pace than other states since our city has tech jobs. this allowed people to start working from home early. seattle's doing great, and statistics are showing that the curve is very slowly flattening (barely below 200 on may 11th! thank you healthcare workers :') ) but even a small, localized outbreak leads to trouble, and we have seen that with other countries who have started to become less restrictive when their cases have dropped. i know a lot of fellow peers right now are feeling hella lonely, sad, anxious, etc., and i know this would suck for the incoming freshman, but the more we take this pandemic seriously and the safer measures we take, the less *deaths* and diagnoses we will have to see. for many people, this is a *deadly* pandemic.

*edit: wrong # of cases per day in the usa. should be 20,000+ people per day being diagnosed.",discussion

"questions about physics 141 and cs 300 level for freshman schedule. hello,

i am incoming freshman cs major to uw, and have been contemplating possible schedules for fall quarter. 

currently, i’m considering

math 134
physics 141
some english gen-ed currently unknown

i have a couple of questions, the two big ones being
1. is it worth taking physics 141? i am set on math 134, but debating if physics 141 will be a good fit. my reasoning for considering it:

- i like physics, and the regular intro series will have some repeat material from high school but i don’t get credit to skip it, and i’ve heard 12x is horrid. 
- i would significantly prefer a harder and  more time consuming class that is interesting than one which is straight busy work and weedouty. i haven’t been able to find out if the new physics 141 or the honors version of 121 are signficant improvements over normal 121 (if honors is still weedouty or a very large time increase, i will probably not take it, so experience here is really appreciated!)
- it will only be worth it to me if its actually a different class. like math 134 is really different from 124-126, but if phys 141 is just more convoluted problems rather than more interesting problems, its a huge turnoff.

my second question is: 
2. should i take a cs class first quarter? math is a must, and i’d love a physics class, but cs is first priority long term(4 years). its the short term i’m debating

my reasoning for not taking a cs class first quarter are:
- i will have credit for cs 143, so i have a bit of breathing room to take some other classes i want to take first quarter (like physics and math) and start 300s in winter.
- the workload seems daunting. college will be a big transition even without the possibility of online classes in the fall, and it might be better to save my core foundational major classes for the winter after i’ve adapted a bit in. also, 3 stem is already hard i’ve heard, let alone honors.

these have led me to decide between the previously said schedule above, an alternative with cs instead of physics, or an extreme workload one.

math 134
a useful cs 300 class (351,331,341 depending on whats available to me)
some english class


math 134
cs 300 class
physics 141

so what are your thoughts? comments that provide anecdotal experience with any of the classes above or advice backed up by some form of evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, are really appreciated. i’m set on math 134 because i’ve talked to friends with experience, but i haven’t been able to find that with phys 141 or the previous honors section of 121, so i’m lost on that front.

i’m coming from an out-of-state 4-year university applying to the linguistics department and i’m freaking out with due dates from my current school (i’m not looking forward to paying almost 3k without knowing if i will even be going to that school anymore). most of the people i’ve heard from that have gotten decisions already were from in-state cc’s. i’m just curious if there was a correlation between when people heard back and where they were transferring from. 

i apologize if you guys are tired of posts like these, but i have a lot riding on this transfer and with this current situation going on in the world, an already stressful situation has gotten much worse.",admissions

"dont do hybrid, just don't. as an international student who read the email sent to proffessors and the most important takeaway is that they are focusing on getting classes under 50 in person and over 50 offered online.

i understand that learning at home isn't the best and that some classes need to be in-person but i for one do not want to spend a total of about 3000 - 5000$ on travel expenses and then around 2000 - 4000$ more for housing just so i can attend the one or two classes that are to be in person.

at my cc, i was advised to pursue a pre nursing degree to complete all my prerequisites and gen ed’s. does anyone know if that would be okay since i’m not doing nursing.

"i need some advice as a preface, i would like to acknowledge that there are multiple things i could have done along the way to prevent this and also to take full responsibility for my mistakes.

last september i was accepted to uw and directly admitted to foster as a freshman. i did running start and was able to complete almost all of the required lower division classes. as a result, i’ve had the opportunity to complete my degree (finance) within 2 years, which i am currently working towards.

under my current plan, assuming nothing major changes, i am on track to graduate next spring. this would normally be great if it were not for the fact that i don’t have an internship this summer and will be graduating without ever securing one. doing running start was great, but applying to summer finance positions as a small town high school student made it very difficult to secure an internship then.

when i was admitted into uw at the fall, i was admittedly overwhelmed with all the networking and recruiting and was a bit of a mess. eventually, i got things sorted out, granted later than most, but was able to get an internship offer. although i got an offer, i ended up turning it down. i turned the offer down because 1) i was still talking with several other recruiters and things looked promising and 2) i had a very short timeline to decide on the offer without the opportunity to postpone. unfortunately, things didn’t work out with the other companies and in the end, i have been left without an offer.

so now i’m sort of stuck here in a tricky situation and i am not really sure what the best course of action would be. i am really worried that i will be graduating and won’t be able to get a full-time offer. any advice offered would be greatly appreciated as i am completely unsure what my next steps should look like.",advice

"engrud (p1 2020) placement megathread **tl;dr:** an engrud placement megathread for information, advice and resources for the upcoming engrud cycle.

over the past week, a couple redditors have pm'd me regarding information or advice regarding the upcoming engrud placement cycle. i realised that especially a week before the deadline for the application, the subreddit may have many questions coming up regarding the engrud placement cycle. so i reached out to u/charlesfries to see if we could have a megathread for questions, advice and resources related to the engrud placement cycle, so that it would make it easier for people to find the information they need to have a great upcoming placement during this crucial time.

**from** u/poop_toilet (inde 2022) on **weekly** /r/udub **discussion - june 21, 2020** \[source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/hdcgq0/weekly\_rudub\_discussion\_june\_21\_2020/fvtrr2b](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/hdcgq0/weekly_rudub_discussion_june_21_2020/fvtrr2b?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\] :

only request majors you would be 100%  happy with. if you have a definitive 1st choice that you would be  willing to reapply for in winter if you get rejected during p1, only  request that major because if you are placed in another major during p1  you will be locked into the 2nd or 3rd choice major you requested.

\[here is all the engrud placement data so far\] ([https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement/data](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement/data)).  a general rule is if your target major(s) placed more students than requested, then you will most likely be placed no problem as long as you  meet the basic criteria. one exception to this rule is ee, as lots of  highly qualified students request compe 1st choice and ee 2nd choice,  inflating the apparent chances of getting into ee without a solid gpa.

put  a lot of work into your personal statement to offset  extracurricular/gpa weaknesses. people who claimed to put a lot of work  into their personal statement and gave the engineering-related  experiences on their resume context tended to win competitive placement  spots over others with higher gpas.

a lot of other common questions are probably answered \[here\] ([https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement)) anyways, so read through all that before you ask the same faq's that have been answered dozens of times already.

i found most people that i knew only  chose to apply to their top choice during p1 and figured if it didn't  work out they could select all the majors in p2. it seemed most people i  knew got their top choice during p1 though!

i  would say for my own personal case, i had a pretty average gpa with  everyone else (about a 3.3) and i feel like they weighed my resume and  essay more heavily so i would put emphasis on that aspect. i was  involved in a few rsos and stuff so that helped for sure!in my essay i  talked about what area of impact i was thinking about going in and how i  would use the major i wanted to reach my goals for that.

i  was able to submit my resume to the career center and they sent back  this rubric/checklist they graded my resume on so that helped a lot in  building it. ([https://careers.uw.edu/online-resume-review/](https://careers.uw.edu/online-resume-review/)) but most of the stuff i submitted i took from the assignments i did in my e-fig i was in and edited to make it stronger.

- i remember paying for college in the high school credit with my french class but i have no idea what to do with this information. should it be on my final transcript? is it automatic or is there something i have to do? it seems like i payed the fee and the money just disappeared to be honest.

- how should i be preparing for picking classes? what should i be looking at? i think i want to go into design. is that even important right now? there’s probably a website that tells me what i should be taking my first years or what i have to take but i don’t know what it is. it seems like a lot of people already know what they’re going to try and sign up for and i’m just lost. 

- how do i know if i should be taking placement tests? if i want to continue with an eventual major in design, is math or chemistry a thing that i need to take regardless? if i don’t take them, what happens with my options for these subjects? are they only for people who want to move ahead? will i just be placed in whatever is next. for example, if i ended on pre-calculus, would i be eligible for calculus? i guess this pairs with the point before of how do i know which classes i have to take.

- when will we know which classes will be online? i’ve been looking at myplan and it doesn’t seem to indicate which classes will be online or in-person. it’s a little difficult to plan your schedule if you don’t know which is online and which is not. am i just missing something?

thus, i wonder if 1. i should still take them in fall 2020 for the same courses or not? 2. would it be wise to take cc courses for math 126 and cse 143 considering they’re program core courses? if not, then which courses should i sub w/ cc credits?",academics

"potential uw freshman questions hi! i’m looking at/applying to colleges soon and uw seems to be one of the schools i’ll most likely end up at. i’m from the seattle area right near uw so my parents are really pushing for me to go to uw and live at home to save money. i’m pretty social and love meeting new people and hanging out, but i’m still super worried because i’ve heard that the social life is not great at uw especially if you don’t live right on campus or join greek life, and i’m not that interested in joining a sorority. 
so i just wanted to hear some opinions about parties and making friends as a freshman if you don’t live in the dorms or go greek, because honestly i feel like it would make for a very depressing college experience and i would hate it :( 
basically, i’m not sure if i should save money and sacrifice my social life and happiness by living at home, or if it is worth it to dorm freshman year.

"sevp requires nonimmigrant international students to leave the country if taking all online courses in autumn a friend of mine just shared [this broadcast message](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during) with me and i was really shocked reading it. an important takeaway is:

>nonimmigrant students within the united states are not permitted to take a full course of study through online classes. if students find themselves in this situation, they must leave the country or take alternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant status such as a reduced course load or appropriate medical leave.

&#x200b;

update: found [this more detailed document](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcm2007-01.pdf). it specifically states that:

>for the fall 2020 semester, continuing f and m students outside of the united state, whose schools of enrollment are only offering online classes, may remain in active status in sevis if they are taking online courses and are able to meet the normal full course of study requirements or the requirements for a reduced course of study. only students enrolled at a school that is only offering online coursework can engage in remote learning from their home country. in this case, dsos should annotate the student’s record to make it clear that the student is outside the us but taking full time online courses as that is the only choice offered by the school.

as per this, it seems like there would be two cases:

1) if uw went completely online, then all nonimmigrant international students must leave the united states;

2) if uw remained hybrid, then all nonimmigrant international students who are currently outside the united states must stay in the states for autumn quarter to maintain their status.

"clarity on the hfs housing addendum hi there, i've been reading through recent housing post responses from /u/uw_hfs as well as the uw hfs addendum on myhfs and i'm getting some contradictory responses.

the official 2020-21 hfs public health agreement addendum states:

>the following is an addendum to your 2020-21 housing agreement. all students who wish to live on campus for the 2020-21 year must agree to this addendum **by 11:59 p.m. (pdt) on july 12, 2020**.  
>  
>applicants who do not complete this form will have their 2020-21 housing application and agreement cancelled by hfs at no charge and will not be permitted to live on campus.

from what i gather, this means that if you do not wish to live on campus in the fall but want to have a chance to apply in winter and spring, you must sign the addendum and then cancel your 9-month housing plan on myhfs. however, a recent response (link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/hpy5fd/housing_options_for_midway_through_the_year/fxur1f6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)) by /u/uw_hfs contradicts the passage above:

>if you’re not planning to live on campus for autumn quarter, you should not sign the addendum and you should cancel your housing, today. everyone who cancels will be contacted in the next few months with instructions on how to apply for winter quarter if they would like to apply for winter quarter.

this doesn't address the scenario where a student doesn't want to live on-campus during the autumn quarter, but wishes to reapply in winter. if a student doesn't sign the addendum because they don't want to live in the autumn quarter (as per the statement above), they won't have a chance to reapply in the winter, spring, or summer either. 

could we get some clarification as to what students should do regarding the addendum if they wish to apply for housing in the winter/spring but not during autumn?

well, i'm failing really bad right now. i got a 51/100 on the first test and my professor's had to give me so many accommodations already because i missed the first quiz and a discussion post. at this rate, i'd be lucky to get a 1.7. none of this is curved. the emails i get from the professor always sound so passive aggressive, and he doesn't sound like he trusts me very much because of how much he's had to go out of his way for me. i just feel... deflated.

i've been debating on dropping the class. the deadline to drop the class and get any sort of refund on tuition was the 13th, so if i drop, i lose about $600. i still haven't paid for webassign. the trial ended yesterday, so i can't even check my grades, and there's an assignment due tonight. if i drop, i won't have to pay for webassign. if i try to tough this out, i'll have to fork over for webassign and have to rush to finish the assignment today, while i might not even pass the class.

i asked a psych advisor today, and he said i can afford to wait until next summer to take calc again, which is great to hear. but i don't know how next summer will look for me. i may not even be in the country to take classes. and even then, i live kind of far away from any community colleges as it is, which means i'd have to find a place that offers online calc classes that are transferable to uw.

"cs da imposter syndrome i'm a cs da from 1st cohert (so i'm a 2nd year).

i had a low sat and hs gpa (compared to the rest of the da's) and i had zero college credits (didnt get high enough scores for my ib exams) coming to udub.

every da i talked to were taking classes like cse 311, 331, math 126, 308, etc. and i felt shame saying i'm only taking math 120 and english 131 my first quarter. i felt so disconnected from the rest of the da's because they took higher level classes than i did.

when i took cse 142 and 143, there were so many dedicated students who knew more than i did who were trying to get into cse themselves. a couple of those people told me i don't deserve to be in cs.

all these weedout classes have such a gloomy atmosphere to it. and all of them are curved. i want to learn and track my progress. i don't want to be compared to others. it hurts to know that even tho im doing fairly well, other people are failing the classes because of the competiveness. i hate weedout classes and taking them has really hurt my mental health.

seeing all these denied from cs posts on reddit and seeing how they have 4.0's in weedout classes and how they have all these cse extracurriculars but still got rejected makes me feel unqualified. i don't have any cse extracurriculars and i have a around 3.5 gpa currently.

i'm ashamed of my resume and my college numbers. i tried very hard and work tirelessly for  my 3.4+ in my math and cs classes at udub. i don't have cs extracurriculars, i had very little cs knowledge coming into this school. i came to udub and had cs as my first choice major because i wanted to start learning computer science.

"weird soc 206 assignment i’m in soc 206 a this summer with hohlt and a big chunk of the grade are videos/presentations we turn in weekly. honestly i’m not very good with video editing so i went looking for projects from previous years to guide my process. when i searched “soc 206” on youtube, i found a bunch of videos from other schools’ courses but i also found the [channel of a current group](https://www.youtube.com/channel/uchuysbvsctbslmrkpvx_upw).

their first three videos are normal and fit the syllabus, but after that things get weird. the img video is a pretty clear separation and while i wouldn’t say the others are outwardly odd, they’re clearly not intended to be turned in or shown to the professor.

i haven’t watched that far into any of the lowercase-title videos, but in the “topic selection” one, the most recent video published, they mention that they’re planning to keep the videos private. i’m not sure why they made them public given that info and i’m kinda wondering if i should do anything to inform them. i don’t want them to think i was trying to plagiarize but i also want to notify them about the channel in case someone broke into the account. i also know i might just be overthinking the fear of someone claiming academic misconduct but i figure it’s better to be cautious.

edit: the students haven’t replied to my email, but hohlt assured me this morning that he’ll handle things if they get out of hand. he thinks the weird videos are just a side project and that he’ll be “interested to see how it turns out”.",advice

"help with picking classes for freshman (figs) hi,

i'm an incoming freshman and a foster admit. i'm not sure which online classes to sign up for especially for the upcoming fall quarter. i'm not that strong at math or science but i need to knock out the english requirement, microecon (econ 200), and math requirement but i don't know when i should take them in addition to taking figs? is there a figs cluster that you recommend taking that combines easier and fun courses that fulfills any of these requirements?

i'm thinking of taking the ""taking your first steps in business"" fig which includes: **engl 111** f: composition: literature, **math 111** b: algebra with applications, and **math 111 ba** (all worth 12 credits)? is that doable along with taking drama 101 for fall quarter? then taking math 112 winter quarter and econ 200 spring quarter or winter??

is there a benefit to just taking a fig with the gen st 199 and one other class like econ 200 or is it worth more to just take a cluster of classes within a fig?

i'm also interested in the fig called ""future lawyers"" taught by fig leader: sam eden. **lsj 200** a: introduction to law, societies, and justice, lsj 200 af (quiz section), **engl 131** x4: composition: exposition, **gen st 297** w: pre-law 101. i'm kind of interested in law (although it's not my major) but would the workload for this fig be too much?

another fig i'm thinking about taking is ""future lawyers: introduction to law, societies, and justice and interdisciplinary writing"" which has **lsj 200:** intro to law, societies, and justice, lsj 200 ai (quiz section), and **engl 298** linked writing course: lsj 200. would the workload for this fig be too time consuming?

what about fig: ""understanding social problems"" with courses: **engl 298 g**: linked writing course: soc 270, **soc 270** a: social problems, and soc 270 ad (quiz section)?

second to last, what about fig: ""future lawyers: introduction to law, societies, and justice and interdisciplinary writing"" with courses: **lsj 200 a: introduction to law, societies, and justice**, lsj 200 ai (quiz section), and **engl 298 j: linked writing course**: lsj 200. would the workload for this fig be too much?

lastly, what about fig: ""understanding social problems"" with classes **engl 298 g: linked writing course:** soc 270, **soc 270 a: social problems,** and soc 270 ad (quiz section)? so far this fig is open for registration. would the amount of writing for these classes be too much??

"is a “k” grade a standard thing, and is it something i should worry about? i began college at wwu, fall 2018, chemistry premajor, but had to withdraw due to health conditions the subsequent winter quarter. i had a 4.0 gpa fall quarter, but winter quarter i could only complete two of my courses and ended up with an incomplete/“k” grade for chem ii. it’s factored into my gpa as a 0.0, so my winter 2019 gpa is like 2.67 . 

i don’t go to wwu anymore. i’m just about to finish my as at a community college and apply to uw (because of its engineering program) for admission autumn 2021. chem ii is one of the prerequisites for engineering transfer and my as, so i’m taking it as one of my last classes for my associates this fall. 

long story short, if i retake chem ii and get a 4.0 on my community college transcript, will it blot out the 0.0 i got at wwu? would uw even give a fuck about this sort of thing when i apply for transfer? i’ve never had to retake a class so i don’t know how retaking a class would affect your gpa. all i see is the k grade lowered my gpa and i wanna know if this is a universal kind of thing, or “k” is just notation only used by wwu",admissions

hot (maybe shit) take: honestly i think it is good to exaggerate/risk over-stressing how low the chances of success for pre-sciences intended cs students are. while it is technically possible to get into cse from pre-sciences and non-interest-changer, the reality is that the vast majority of people who try won't succeed because 1) the acceptance rate is misleading because a huge number of people self-select out of the application pool after getting mediocre grades and are literally told not to apply by cse admissions, 2) the application pool is already of people who got into uw, meaning all the ""long shot"" freshman applications are filtered out, and 3) everyone in the application pool chose to go to uw intended cs despite being warned of the risks (except interest-changers), meaning they were all reasonably confident in their abilities to get in and willing to work very hard. additionally, the consequences of getting rejected from your major are much, much worse than getting rejected from a college as a freshman because by the time people get rejected from a major they have already invested 1-2 years of their entire undergrad career. most pre-sciences intended cs ppl don't seem to truly get this. instead, most people way overestimate their abilities, get lured in by the potential reward of gambling on uw, severely underestimate how competitive admissions are, and might not be properly informed to begin with.

in part i blame this on the fact that this sub and other places seem to frame the issue as ""if you don't get direct admit, that just means you need to try hard! here are some application tips for when you apply to cs in your sophomore year. oh, but you should probably consider other schools as well."" i think a much healthier framing is to tell high school seniors to treat a rejection from da as a rejection and move on, kinda like how people treat getting waitlisted. since the current admissions pathway for cs from pre-sciences is intended for interest-changers, imo it's kinda misleading to view this as a ""second chance"" to get into cse if people are rejected from da.

moreover, the huge sea of cs rejects hurts the morale of pretty much the whole school since many majors have a large number of people who don't actually want to be there. that's a drag on everyone in those departments' college experience and it's even worse for the people who are in a major they're unhappy with. it also unfairly stigmatizes majors that people use as ""backup programs"" by creating an impression that people in these majors are only there because they couldn't get into cse. i'm double majoring in cs and one of the majors that are seen this way (with more of my focus/passion/career plans put into this major than cs) and it frankly hurts that people's passion in the subject/major are looked down on in this way. i see this as a big culture problem for the university that reducing the number of prospective cs students at uw would largely solve.

i'm curious to see what people think about a potential solution: ban ppl who apply for da from applying to the major as a current student. this could maybe solve the problems that cs admissions has on other departments and help students' mental health by preventing them from spending years trying and failing to get into cse, while maintaining the pathway for interest changers.

"created a personal finance cash flow projection spreadsheet - uw themed for the upcoming school year! so...i have been utilizing a paid financial tool for a long time that allowed me to input financial events in a calendar that displayed projected account balances on each day of the month forecast however long in the future that i would like based on the expenses/income that i input. yesterday i had the thought that i could do this pretty easily in google sheets instead of paying a monthly fee. naturally as i was working, i thought to utilize uw's brand guidelines which led me to think that maybe, just maybe i could put it out there and help some people with financial woes for this upcoming year!

the spreadsheet is formatted like a yearly calendar. you can start by entering your starting balance for your savings/checking accounts at the top of the month of august tab (or if you're getting to this late, you can start in september). each day you can input as many as seven financial events, all sorted into checking expense/income or savings expense/income. each time you input a financial event, the balance at the bottom of each day will reflect that days events and any previous events. the first tab on the spreadsheet is an example of a months expenses and other features explained within a couple of cell notes (marked with a black triangle in the top right of a cell).

any questions/comments can be posted here and i will try to keep the sheet updated with anything that might be incorrect/needs improvement!

i’m currently a homeless student at the uw. i was just sent my financial aid offer which covered tuition, yet it didn’t cover the cost of housing or food, which i’m concerned about. i just wanted to know how often uw grants full rides and if they grant them to students who are homeless. i was also wondering how the financial aid letter appeal process is, and if there’s anything i can do to increase my chances of more aid. thanks in advance!",advice

"likelihood of uw closing dorms... i’ve been seeing a lot of comments around this sub lately about how “hfs is definitely gonna send students back home a week after classes start” or “dorms are not gonna last until december” and such, and so i wanted to make this post as a sort of discussion for that topic.


personally speaking, i don’t see a scenario where hfs has to close. there’s no argument that spring was the height of the pandemic for washington, and the surge of cases that came with july 4th has mellowed out and we’re back at a ~2% positivity rate with tests in king county. so, as it stands, we are doing better than spring and yet dorms remained open during that time.


also, i believe it was u/uw_hfs (could’ve been someone else) who commented here before detailing how hfs has learned a lot from the spring experience and will be taking care of things even better (regarding disinfection and whatnot), so assuming cases only get as bad as they were at the height of the pandemic so far, hfs will be better-equipped.


most of the colleges that have closed dorms are at high-risk areas. some haven’t even closed at all and are handling it in a different way, like in tennessee. a college over there decided to evacuate a single residence hall and just use it for students who need to self-isolate. well, hfs already has that with hansee i believe, which shows their level of preparation, and has unused buildings like mcmahon and haggett that could be used for that if it ever came down to that.


i might be underestimating the potential surge in cases that can come with students returning to campus, but i’m sure you guys already know that greek houses were active all summer and many more greek students returned a couple weeks ago and this week. and still, cases trend down significantly. of course, things change when you throw oos students into the mix and those from eastern wa, but i think a poll on here (not super representative, i know) showed that many oos students are not flying out here and on-campus residents are primarily in-state (makes sense).


i guess i’m biased because i plan on staying on-campus, but this whole “hfs gonna close down right away, we’re fucked” thing is a huge assumption that is based off the experiences of schools in hotspots (aka, conservative states). hfs has re-iterated over and over that they are well-equipped to handle whatever is coming, and worst-case they’ll put residence halls into quarantine mode like some other colleges have done. but i don’t even think that’ll happen.


in order for hfs to consider closing, i think the daily cases have to get significantly worse than the july 4th height. that was 900-1000 daily cases for washington, and like ~300 for king county (someone correct me if i’m wrong). now, it’s up to you to decide: are we gonna go from 200-300 cases a day (now) to 900-1000 cases a day in october just from uw dorms reopening? and can it get worse than that? 


anything can happen, so i hope it doesn’t come to hfs closing down, but it doesn’t hurt to be a bit more optimistic. dorms were never the best places to party anyway (mcmahon was the only place where it can be pulled off and that building is closed lmao)


the way the ima is operating right now shows how seriously uw takes the coronavirus i think. my friends claim the ima is “shitty” right now because you can’t even spot someone benching and there’s like only 3 spots to workout in the dumbbell area due to heavy (and necessary) social distancing. sucks, but it says a lot about how much caution is being taken at the uw. have faith!

"unpopular opinion about covid-19 (i think) i will start this post by saying i am an incoming freshman, living on campus this year. 

i see everyone posting about how they completely expect that students living on campus should strictly follow all social distance requirements, and should avoid meeting and spending time with new people. from what i understand, people fear that with enough cases at the uw, everyone will be sent home, and no one wants that. but this reaction to send the student populations with high covid counts home is entirely irresponsible. for the overwhelming majority, most students are not affected anymore than they are with the seasonal flu unless they have pre-existing health problems. sending students home will only spread covid to hundreds of communities across the country. 

i wish i could have a normal freshman year, where i could learn effectively by being in a classroom environment. i wish that i could feel a sense of community at the university that my family pays so much for. i wish that i would be able to meet friends, and socialize. i fear that for the first quarter (at the least), life on campus will be miserable. 

it just seems so egregious and pointless to keep students apart from each other, so long as they live on campus, and can’t spread it outwards. the sacrifice that our university is forcing us to make seems reactionary and unnecessary. it seems very unreasonable to me, but it also seems like i am a part of the overwhelming minority in this discussion. let me know your opinions.

1. it's to my understanding that freshmen can only apply to a general/pre-major for some of the majors, correct? i want to major in bio and specialize/minor in botany, but there's only like a general bio major available on coalition. there's no way for me to choose a minor rn, correct? and i'll have the option to switch into my preferred major later?
2. is the coalition essay optional, as in you can write and submit it if you want, or do they not want it at all? i was looking at the application, and there doesn't even seem to be a place to submit it?
3. i'm looking to apply for the honors system, and there's only 2 more supplemental essays you need to write for it, correct? there's no complete other application?

if you can help, thank you so, so much! (also, i have a 4.26 gpa, and a 34 on the act, only a few extracurriculars, and i go to a highly competitive public school--do you think i have a shot at getting in or making the honors program? tysm!!)",admissions

"paid user interview for uw students interested in mental health hi there! we ([ensu](https://ensu.com/)) are looking for some uw students to help us with user testing as we look to build a free tool to help students with mental health.

we all go through a lot of shit in our lives, and it's super easy to feel like we're the only ones who are going through what we're going through. the fact is though that this isn't true, and there are a lot of other people who've also been through what we're currently facing, and have made it out the other side stronger. something that helped me a lot (i've been through pretty severe depression and anxiety in the past) was finding people who'd been through what i was facing, and hearing from their experiences of what they tried that worked / didn't work, and what advice they'd have for their younger self in my position.

we're building a new feature that lets you listen to short snippets of wisdom and actionable advice, specific to your issues and challenges, from people who've stood where you're standing. you can think of it as 2-5 minute mini-podcasts for what you're going through today.

for user testing, we're looking for current students or people who graduated from uw within the last 12 months. this will be a \~45 minute call with out head of product, [chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robeck/), who will ask all sorts of random questions about mental health and audio listening, and we will compensate $10 for the call. we also have some longer term involvement options that we can touch base on at the end of the call.

if you're interested in helping out in testing, please please fill out this google form [https://forms.gle/vbjv7q7btmxrf1qv9](https://forms.gle/vbjv7q7btmxrf1qv9) and we'll get back to you very shortly with more information and details.

"[remote proctoring] protect your privacy, folks. hello!  

i hope remote learning is treating you fairly and that you are well in whatever location covid has stranded you.

one of my professors is requiring students to download the proctoru add-on for exams and other exercises. i was unfamiliar with it until recently (this is the first i have heard of it), but after researching it and reading what permissions it has, i can't help but feel like this is a massive violation of privacy. distrotube did [a feature on it](https://youtu.be/xrm1lxfn3vw), and i am honestly appalled. distro can be pretty intense, but his analysis is on-point. the letter he mentions from western sydney university can be found [here](http://cucfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/proctoru_2020-1.pdf).

from what i have found, not only does it collect sensitive personal information, proctoru (and like-minded services) can access your search history, processes, and system information. proctoru's [privacy policy](https://www.proctoru.com/privacy-policy) has been cleaned up or updated since distro made his video; a bold statement saying they would never sell your information is stapled to the top of the page. proctoru's privacy policy does (see: ""third party sharing"") clearly state that they have no qualms about transferring a student's information to third parties. so they will not sell your information, but they will hand it over if they are acquired or a similar situation arises, which is *almost* identical. also troubling to me is that the company records your audio and video, keeping it on record for ""as long as necessary"" (see: ""data retention""). 

i cannot imagine this sits well with many people, but perhaps i wear a thicker tinfoil hat than others. in a day and age where technology advances at breakneck speed and selling user information is a highly lucrative and common business, i cannot believe that this software is being used or even legal. has this issue been raised to the uw? is there a place *to* raise this issue? my greatest fear is reaching out to faculty about my skepticism, and having my professor fail me purely out of spite.

"question about majors at uw hello there, my name is aidan and i was wondering if anybody had any knowledge about majors at university of washington. specifically, i wanted to apply for the visual communication design major in the arts department but i saw they had these prerequisites:

1. minimum 2.50 cumulative gpa
2. 5 credits college-level art with a minimum 2.5 grade
3. art does not accept postbaccalaureate applicants.

unfortunately, i do not have that 2nd requirement so would i be correct in assuming i probably wouldn't get in my first year? if so, what would be a good plan to get into uw and then eventually get into that major? i've heard that general admission can be risky so would i have to apply for a similar major and then transfer?",advice

having both of these courses at the same time meant i was taking 5 classes total and it pushed me over the 18 credit limit briefly.  i dropped 237 within a few days, but because i had both in my schedule at some point, i'm now getting a tuition statement to pay the credit overload fee. i never planned to take ochem and honors ochem concurrently (nor do i think it's technically allowed), but for now i've paid the fee as not to accrue late charges. however i would like to push for a refund/waiver if possible as obviously my intention was never to take two versions of the same class simultaneously. does anyone know of a way to get this refunded? i'm definitely gonna call the finaid office on monday to ask about it too but rn i'm kind of panicking so any advice would be appreciated. like, should i email them now too? or just wait to call them on monday?

i've noticed many of my high school classmates some of them failed a class, graduating uw, (those who failed a class in hs probably did running start, and did well in it and transferred to uw).

i don't belong here in washington or seattle, apparently the vibe here and i are completely opposite. if you knew me in real life, i guarantee you'd hate me.

in case you're wondering the really hard classes that i struggled with is math 124, math 125, music 116, astr 101, pols 201.

i didn't go back to community college, because i was dealing with some minor case of ptsd. well not really the ptsd you understand from military but you know, bullying and racism at uw campus.

honestly, i did use all 4 years of grant money, and somehow i flopped. i did okay in the first 2 years but couldn't decide on a major, only decided on one to remove the 105 credit rule.

could someone explain to me the difference between a dog person and a cat person? i figured not, this is the wrong subreddit for that.

"faq for astr 101, 150, and ess 102 these are some pretty popular classes people take for either nw or i&s credits. i've taken all three so i wanted to provide some helpful information that i've seen people ask now-and-then on this sub.

these questions apply to all three classes (or where otherwise stated):

* are there math/physics pre-reqs?

>no. you need no knowledge or understanding of physics whatsoever for any of the classes. you don't need anything more than knowing arithmetic. **all physics and math necessary to pass the course will be covered in class or in class materials.**

* how much time lecture/study/etc per week?

>for all of these classes, you should expect to forfeit a mere 6-8 hours of your time most weeks.

* asynchronous?

>yes to all, but ess 102 moves a little faster, so i wouldn't postpone the work too much

* lectures necessary?

>100%. these classes are completely covered in the lectures. don't worry thought. that doesn't mean your hands are going to fall off at the end of each lecture. the profs are very clear in what information you should be taking away.

* how good are these online?

>the astronomy department has had astr 101 and 150 online since 2015, so it's super streamlined already. ess 102 doesn't have that same history, but it already seems to have most of the kinks out of the system. either way, all of these courses are super lenient in helping you get the grade you want.

* what is the homework like? (ess 102)

>**weekly labs that take 15-30 minutes.** the labs appear to be really long at first glance because they typically have a lot of questions, but most of the questions are asking you to either regurgitate information from the lectures or are asking for information that proves you did some of the physics activities.  
>  
>note: normally the class would be taken in person and thus would have labs at the university; using tools provided by the university to demonstrate the physics covered in the lectures. i'm taking the class right now and would say they have done a good job at creating labs that require nothing more than your cell phone, a ruler, and access to internet.

* what is the homework like? (astr 101, 150)

>astr 101/150 both have weekly discussion questions (dq), which you basically find a article that relates to a prompt, and then write a few sentences summarizing the article you found. i found astr 101 dq's took on average less time than astr 150. 150 is a lot more technical than 101, so sometimes it took me like an hour or two just to find an article that was long enough to write about. **expect 10 minutes or more on the dq**.  
>  
>on top of that there are ""labs"". astr 101 labs are generally more interactive and involve using some pretty fun programs. in those labs you basically answer questions that proved you messed around with the programs. both astr 101 and 150 also involve questions that involve using equations learned in class and writing short answers that prove you understand how the math/physics works. **expect 10-30 minutes on the labs.**

* do i need to read the textbook? (astr 101, 150)

>no. you do not need to read the textbook to pass, however, i found the textbook especially helpful  for getting more information on topics that weren't quite clear to me.

* is the textbook free? (astr 101, 150)

>astr 101 textbook pdf should be provided on your class canvas page for free. paper copies are also available for purchase (relatively cheap too!). astr 150: iirc textbook wasn't free, but also wasn't necessary either. so...

* how do i get help with the class?

>not exactly an faq, but something i want to make clear to people who haven't taken any astronomy related courses:  
>  
>the professors and tas who are in or associated with the astronomy department are **super** nice and helpful. it's a niche department at the uw, but i think that makes these people some of the most eager to make sure you understand the material.

&#x200b;

**course content:**

* astronomy 101
   * great detail into all of the laws of physics behind gravity and planetary motion; different types of stars and galaxies; and the origins of the universe and star formation
   * also covers good amount of the history of astronomy, but it is not really tested on
   * vague on formation of planets
* astronomy 150
   * very brief and vague on all of the information covered in astr 101. could potentially be confusing for people who have no understanding of the laws of physics, but that being said, you really only need to know how to use the equations. also this material makes up a fraction of the course as a whole.
   * great detail into the formation of our planets; the different types of planets, their chemical makeup, and why they contain said materials; how to identity the age of a planet's surface.
* ess 102
   * the first half of the class is basically a crash course on astr 150. thus the laws of physics and more general concepts which were briefly covered in 150, are covered exponentially faster in ess 102. that being said, you can always get help from the ta's.
   * the second half of the course is geared towards preparing you for the final project. thus the topics shift towards orbital mechanics and planetary research missions.

&#x200b;

**tl;dr**

* astr 101 can be taken by anyone. super easy class that is all about understanding the concepts (as opposed to the math and physics).
* astr 150 can be a little more challenging. since the course is designed for people with no background to be able to take the course, some necessary material covered in astr 101 has to be covered rapidly in order to make time for the prime material of the class. both classes offer the same credit, so i would recommend taking 101 before 150 if you can or have little to no understanding of how the universe work.
* ess 102 involves material from both astr 101 and 150, but mostly 150. since ess 102 has to involve all of that information in addition to orbital mechanics and planetary missions (like probes and robots), the course can feel super fast at times. that being said, just like the astr classes, this course technically provides you with all the information necessary to pass. it just comes down to how well you are able to absorb and understanding the material. if you need nw credits on top of the i&s provided by the class, i would recommend you take astr 150 at a minimum before this class.

"how to satisfy the foreign language requirement in my situation? hello.

i am an international student currently studying at shoreline community college and i plan to transfer to uw's international relations major. to provide a little bit of background, i was born in indonesia but i moved to singapore at a very young age and spent most of my youth there, i speak both english and indonesian (at a conversational level).

this is the part where i am really confused, so please correct me if i am wrong. is it true that the foreign language requirement for general admission into uw is the completion of 2 quarters worth of a foreign language? and 3 quarters worth if applying to the jackson school? also, i am currently taking japn&121 (equivalent to uw's japan 1xx) as a foreign language this fall. i was planning on taking japn&122 for winter, but according to shoreline cc's planning sheet, i am unable to take more than 5 credits in a world language at the 100 level.

"your experiences as for japan 102/103 pacing or difficulty? hey all, i'm a freshman and want to complete the first year japanese series for world language credit. i have running start credits for the 1st and 2nd classes of first year series (japan 101 and 102), and my counselor said i qualify for japan 103 at uw.

the thing is, i'm concerned about the pacing or difficulty of uw japanese courses. for comparison the 102 equiv course at my cc took around a little bit more than 2 weeks for each chapter in genki 1. my counselor said it goes quick, recommending i could take 102 again should i need to. however i emailed kaoru ohta sensei and he said i should just take 103 in spring since i've already completed chapter 8 of genki. (i know plain form, て form)

so that's why i came here, on the fence. japanese is one of the few subjects i'm motivated in. i have genki 1 along with the workbook, i know a bunch of resources to self study, though self studying isn't my strong suit and i get lazy.. but that said i'm not sure if i shold just wait and try for a spot in 102 this winter or just get a gen ed out of the way this winter, then self study for 103 in spring.. ?

so tl;dr need foreign language credit, able to take japan 103 in spring and fulfill it, indecisive because of not knowing how ""fast"" or how the pacing is at uw japanese courses",advice

"who do i contact about issues with a professors grading? tldr: i couldn’t answer for a 4th of the questions on my exam and my prof would not help me. who do i talk to?

i had an exam the other day and couldn’t understand a question. even worse the work for said question was needed for other questions and i effectively was unable to answer a forth of my test. i emailed my professor asking for clarification and never got anything back. i emailed again after the test asking if i could have some sort of retest or if i could have those questions ignored from my score and she refused and said she would not say anything else to me until grades were posted. 

i don’t know about everyone else, but any time a test question’s wording was confusing for students that question was either clarified or removed from grading. the one time i was testing at the drs and they couldn’t get ahold of the prof for clarification before the test ended they exempted the question for me. 

i have autism so it can be hard for me to understand or explain something when it comes to words. it’s not the first time i was unable to get clarification for a test question and then it happened that question was not counted for me.

plus several other students posted in piazza with confusion too. 

who do i talk do about this? 

some more details that might matter?:

this is for stat 311. my prof’s reasoning for rejecting my request was that it didn’t look like i understood the concepts for the question in the first place when i originally asked for clarification. from what i understood, the question asked for a description of the sampling distribution, and to find the mean and standard deviation for a histogram that showed the age range of voters vs what percent that age range made of all voters. what confused me was that it asked for the distribution of the 55-64 age voters, not the distribution of all voters, or so i understood it. so i messaged my prof asking if there was supposed to be a scatter plot for this age range because the question asked for a description of the distribution. i then understood it to mean i’m supposed to compare the distribution or in other words percent of voters that were ages 55-64 vs every other age ranger. of course you cant compute a mean or sd for that, but i ran out time, i just wanted to have proof that i was confused on how i was supposed to understand the question, and i needed to put down something. 

i emailed professor again and she said that because i asked her if i was supposed to have a scatter plot, i could have not understood the concept in the first place as this is a question about sampling distribution, which has nothing to do with scatter plots. the reason i asked for a scatter plot was because part of the question asked to describe the distribution which made me thing of that. regardless, as i mentioned in the above paragraph, i then understood the question to ask to compare the percentages of voters age 55-64 vs every other age range which is categorical and would technically give a sampling distribution. however i never mentioned it to her during the exam because she never responded back, what are the odds she would respond this time, and i never mentioned it after because i through it was irrelevant as the bottom line was that i was confused by the question and couldn’t actually answer it. i can’t explain it to her now because the last thing she said to me was that she would not respond anymore until grades were posted.

"warning for new students coming from high school (ap credits) tl;dr: don't apply ap credits to your transcript until you know know you need them to graduate.

edit: there are some insights in the comments that are contrary to what i have in this post, so if anyone is facing this situation, look below for more experiences!

i wanted to make a warning that i really wish i heard from someone before i entered the uw.

once you apply ap credits to your transcript, you cannot take them off.this is an issue because once you reach 225 credits, you are ineligible for financial aid for the credits you take after that.so if you decide to pursue a minor or a double major, which you need to take more credits for, but bring in a bunch of ap credits beforehand, that cap will prevent you from receiving financial aid when you take classes that exceed 225 credits.

my advice is:

* don't apply your ap credits to your transcript until you know:

1. exactly what requirement you are applying them to
2. you will not take a class during your time at uw that would eventually satisfy that requirement anyway

* don't apply ap english(both lang and lit) unless you only need to fill a certain number of credits. they don't fulfill any requirements and are just empty credits.

i have no idea how running start works, so i can't say anything about that.

i'm double majoring and won't be eligible for financial aid during my senior year because of the cap.when i made an inquiry about removing ap credits that i don't need that would put me under the cap until i graduate, the admissions office told me i couldn't.

if anyone has advice for me, that would be much appreciated, but i had no idea this could be an issue when i entered the uw. i was always under the impression from everyone around me that more ap credits were always better. this is not always true, so be wise before sending your scores in.

-part time opportunities. how accessible are they between the two universities both on and off campus?

-i'll be living off campus and commuting in. any significant considerations for either uni/campus on housing or commuting?

-the city. i'm from portland or but have lived in upstate ny for the last few years, what's the general vibe of bellingham vs seattle/tacoma/bothell?

-class size. i know western is far smaller than uw. how does it affect you at your school? is it an issue or a boon?

-extracurriculars. mature students. i'll be a 23 year old off campus freshman. any insight into that experience.

"story of my fall quarter. this quarter started off so well (i thought): interesting classes, reopened restaurants and gyms, and relatively returned social life around campus.

however, looking at myself now, i'm agonized over failed exams, messy living space, fucked up schedule, non-existent social life, receding leanness, and little motivation. i have a few friends whom i used to rely on so much for social life who left the state of washington and won't be back for a while. ima used to be my coping method against stress and anxiety and that's not of any possibility for me. i hate living alone, so i would go out and wander around but even the most ordinary activities like 'having a sip of coffee sitting down' have been taken away from me after nov 17th. where is the laughter in the hub, where is the studiousness in suzallo, where is the constant chatter in kane, where are the smiley faces at the quad. i'm not seeing them and it's breaking my heart.

i know that people say hardship in life teaches one to be stronger and more resilient but i'm inundated by so much inopportune experience all at the same time and i don't have time to recover myself from one to move on to another. to be candid this has arguably been the worst time so far of my 20 years of life. i'm easily irritable, anxious af, depressed, unstable, confrontational, agonized, hopeless, and friendless. my soul is teared apart, i'm a walking cadaver.

i tried to get therapy but since everything is online, i'm not feeling its healing power as it should have given to its recipients if done offline.

i hope everyone of you who's reading this realizes having the company of friends, roomates, family, or even significant others during such harsh times is a luxurious privilege to people like me, and being able to just finish school work while still having a basic schedule is also a respectable achievement that you should be proud of yourself. acknowledge yourself and people around you, be grateful of how life is still moving on although it might seem frivolous for me to say.  at last, smile and be happy for people like me who are unable to do so.

"chances of being admitted to the school of foster i know for a fact that uw school of foster ba program is very competitive to get admitted in, but what i would like to know is what are my chances of getting in.


a little background. i am currently at a community college planning to transfer to uw for fall 2021. my grades currently average out to about a 3.7 gpa. by the time i finish my current quarter (fall 2020) it should average out to a 3.5 gpa ( two of my classes i did very well but in one of them i did not. 4.0, 3.4 and possibly a 3.0 or 2.9? depending how i do on my final). i believe my gpa is in good standing. not to give out to much details, i also have an extensive amount of leadership experience, community building, volunteering, extracurricular activities, and overall, very involved with my school. i think this should also help me with my chances of getting in. 

as a side note, i went to a technical college to be trained in a specific field but the field isn't related to business. it is a college and you're also graded so i'm thinking when i apply that they would also want to see this? they asked for all colleges attended. my grades from this place aren't great, quite literally, they were on the edge of passing/failing. d's across the board with a few c's. this was during my much younger days where i didn't really care what my grades were as long as i passed. 


so, my questions are these:
- if i happen to have an average gpa by the time i apply ( let's say 3.3) but an extensive amount of leadership, extracurricular activities, etc. do you think my chances of being admitted are still good?

- in terms of writing my personal statement to foster ( separate from general uw admissions) how do i explain my poor grades from my technical college with out saying ""yeah, my grades there were bad but that was younger me""? this one im really concerned about if they factor it in and question why its so low.

- any tips in better preparing to transfer? 

feel free to ask questions if you want to know something more specific. thank you for any contribution!

"sophomore cse major who needs help building resume first off please don't be toxic and say stuff like ""you don't deserve to be in cse"" and stuff like that. i heard plenty of that during my freshman year when i took math 12x and cse14x.

i don't have a good or a complete resume yet. the only real thing i have done that looks good on my resume is i've been private tutoring college students in their intro cse classes since the summer. i have a couple of generic stuff like work experience at the library, etc.

so yeah nothing good. i'm planning to try to get internships my junior year but after getting rejected from cse 14x ta application for the second time in a row i'm now worried that i won't be able to build a good enough resume for anyone to hire me as an intern.

i'm still want to be a ta for 14x or maybe even one of the cse major classes like 331. i want to do some personal projects with android and ios apps and put that on my resume. i'll still be private tutoring for the winter quarter but then i will stop because i will be taking 332 and 312 in the spring and i will be focusing on that.

other than that, i'm not sure how i can find opportunities to improve my resume (especially during these covid times). i feel pretty imitated because i know a lot of cse majors who have great resumes and i'm just worried that all the internships will be taken because of the competition.

"my cs solution copied (?) recently i got an email from one of my previous cs professors regarding approximately 14 cases of students currently in his class having code that suspiciously looks like my old code. i looked through a couple of them and most of them are the same line for line (there are a few differences here and there but mainly variable names and the like). i promise that i have not uploaded my code anywhere. i literally banished my files to the farthest corners of my computer's drives. i haven't helped anyone in the class either (i have never contacted someone in the class and don't have any friends taking the class).

i don't want a permanent stain on my academic record regarding academic misconduct. i replied to my professors email immediately saying that i never uploaded the code anywhere or helped anyone in his class. should i do more?

this situation is stressing me out because 14 cases of academic misconduct doesn't seem like the best thing to have on record, especially since i have done nothing. i'm even more worried because i don't really have any evidence on my side other than i know that i didn't do it. i don't want it to turn into a case of my word against theirs.",advice
"can i get into uw postbac for bio? # i am a french major with 3.74 gpa and 204 credits looking to apply to uw bio as a postbac. 

**positives**:

* my overall gpa is 3.74, my major gpa (french) is 3.91, and my bio/chem prereqs gpa (likely the most important factor) is 3.08 (disgusting, i know. i didn't have a chem/bio background so i got nuked in the intro classes.) i'm also a member of phi betta kappa honors society.
* in terms of progress, i completed bio 180, 200, and 220, and chem 145 and 152. i also finished math 124. 
* my current winter registration is for bio 361: genomics, bio 354 and chem 162.  
* i am also aware that statements of purpose are a huge deciding factor regarding acceptance.  i would describe my writing as decently competent, though i am mostly insecure because of my bio/chem gpa and high credit number. 

**negatives**:

* i don't have any research and my last two lab classes were online so i don't have much lab experience. 

# my questions are: 

1) do i have a decent chance of getting in,  or should i just assume the worst?  

2) if my credentials do not look that bad, should i focus on graduating asap with the highest gpa possible, or should i try and finish more upper division bio classes? 

3) will having completed more biology classes (i.e. a higher percentage of the bio degree) undergrad make me more favorable as a postbac applicant? 

# my backup plans:

**1) transfer to a community college and try to complete a bio degree there/reapply to uw as postbac after finishing more bio degree requirements**

if my chances of getting into bio are pretty negligible, then it may be wiser to graduate immediately instead of trying to take bio 361 and 354, in order to take advantage of my gpa as it currently is. 

the downside to this method is that, to my knowledge, while prereqs like physics and ochem are offered at community college, upper class division bio is not (though i could be wrong about this assumption).  

**2) finish bio requirements at a community college and try to take upper division bio classes at uw**

there is the alternative of trying to take them as a non-degree student, but i do not think taking the upper division bio classes as a non-matriculated student is possible as they have a very low dropout rate (i say this as someone who just barely managed to register for them and had some difficulty).  also, while i have been considering the premed pathway, i really want a degree more than to just finish the prereqs because i am aware of the high rejection rate of med school applicants and i do not feel secure just banking my luck on a low possibility. 

overall, i just want to focus on obtaining a bio degree (preferably in physiology).  i have filed some transfer applications to other universities (and am considering community college for basic required classes), and i've been recommended to look into grad school and master's programs, but if possible i would like to apply for postbac. 

**3) desperately try to get more research/lab experience, study for the bio gre, and apply to uw bio grad school**

i don't feel super lucky with this option because i'm a french major instead of a bio undergrad.

**4) apply for a bio master's degree**

see above. also lack of research/lab fieldwork. 

**5) do a complete 180 and take the lsat and apply to law school.**

you might ask: um, so do you like law? and the answer is...uhhh...i mean, i liked legally blonde well enough, i guess. this option is a sort of a desperate shot in the dark, a desperate man's last cry for help.  this option also would probably require me to drop all my current classes in order to keep my gpa as high as it currently is. 

**6) apply for the uw bsn**

i haven't looked totally into this option, so i don't even know if i can be admitted or if they are going to reject me due to credit limit regardless of my gpa like the bio department. chances are, i might not even be able to be admitted due to my 204 credits.

in addition, 60+ students has dropped the class since a few days after my registration day when it was full back then and when the professor wasn't listed. i am wondering if others also saw the low ratings and decide to drop it as well but i have never seen so many students drop a class because of the professor.

i'm in my third year, majoring in physics and music, and last quarter i failed two of my classes for the first time in my life. i completely lost my motivation for school after my daily routine being identical for 9 months straight: all day is spent in front of the computer. my desk is my classroom, where i relax, where i hang out with friends, and where i do homework.

this was after i auditioned to major in music in september and didn't get accepted on the instrument of my preference.

this quarter started off promising, i was hoping to find my motivation for academics again, but after a few weeks of missing and assignment here and there and occasionally missing a lecture because it feels pointless to get out of bed, i've found myself failing 2 classes again. i even took only 12 credits this quarter and it's still too much to handle. i only have enough in me for one class. i've tried again and again to put as much effort into all my classes online as i did when they were in person and i've come the conclusion that after this long i just can't. if they didn't introduce the s/ns option for quarters taken during the global pandemic i would have probably dropped out by now.

"protecting the health of students learning in different time zones: a letter to the uw administration *this message is being sent to ana mari cauce (the president of uw), the daily of uw, and the general audience.*

dear uw administrators,

i am writing this letter to raise awareness of the challenges on the health of student learning in different time zones. in this letter, i present those challenges and potential solutions to mitigate those problems. i invite the uw administration to take actions to address those challenges to build a more inclusive global community.

**executive summary**

amid the pandemic, many students have to learn in different time zones synchronously under current university policy, compromising their health. university policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced to protect the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones. established policies such as the elimination of attendance for grading need to be enforced. policy changes should focus on making time schedules of assessments and discussion sessions more flexible.

**background**

amid covid-19 pandemic, students have to stay at home and learn remotely in different time zones inside and outside of the us. most international students, especially, experience drastic time differences when trying to attend lectures and exams live from their home countries.

attending classes live with hours of difference is not easy. for students studying in hawaii, a 8:30 am pst class translates to attendance at 6:30 am local time. for students studying in east asia, a 10:30 am pst class could mean staying up late 2:30 pm \[correction: am\] late night every weekday. such time difference not only translates to disadvantages when learning materials and taking exams, it also disturbs the students’ circadian clock, causing adverse effects on the student’s physical and mental health.

the adverse effects are not theoretical, nor are they overstated. on february 8th, rensselaer polytechnic institute grieves the passing of kaijie zhang, “a first-semester freshman studying remotely from his family home in wuxi, jiangsu, china” \[1\]. taking classes at night and its associated adverse effects are allegedly the main cause of this tragedy. to prevent such tragedies from happening at uw and for the health of all students learning in different time zones, university policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced. i am confident that these problems will be addressed because “the health and safety of our students, staff, faculty and academic personnel is our university’s highest priority,” writes our president ana mari cauce in her message “the safety of our community is our highest priority” \[2\].

**problems and recommendations**

*time schedule planning*

while synchronous classes with diverse time schedules and asynchronous classes could solve the problem, they are not realistic in large scale because of limited teaching resources and limited learning experience, respectively. however, i suggest the university to explicitly encourage the planning of lecture and quiz sections (if they have multiple sections) at very different times.

for instance, many courses currently offers section a at 9:30 am and section b at 10:30 am, providing students little time flexibility. instead, the policy could encourage planning of section a at 9:30 am and section b at 4:30 pm, accommodating for students from different time zones.

i understand that such strategy may not work for all courses because of limitations such as their sizes, instructor availability, and time conflicts. nevertheless, a small change in the schedule could benefit a large population of students. in addition, ferpa-compliant recordings of synchronous lecture should be required to be uploaded to the cloud for students all students for reference, giving all student the possibility of asynchronous learning.

*exam policy*

another issue that students learning from different time zones face is awkward exam schedule. if a course is offered synchronously, regardless whether its materials are posted for asynchronous learning, its exams are usually strictly synchronous, without exceptions (other than that required by university policy). for example, a student studying from east asia may have to take an exam 3:30 am local time at night for an unnegotiable exam time of 11:30 am pst. again, such late time is not only an disadvantage to academic performance, but it is also poisonous to the students’ physical and mental health. this is easily understandable: if student do not expect instructors to teach late night to accommodate for students in different time zones, then instructors should not expect students in different time zones to take examinations late night.

as a concrete example, many exams in the department of chemistry must be taken synchronously, without exceptions for students learning in different time zones, because instructors “see less issues with academic ethics & integrity if all students take the exam concurrently.” even worse, it is quoted as a departmental policy. this would not be a problem if classes were in person, but remote instruction has to consider of time zone differences to be inclusive of students learning in different time zones.

synchronous exam policies have to be changed. i recommend exams for remote learning to have a time window of 24 hours to start the exam, providing students from different time zones an equal opportunity to perform in their time zones. indeed, such policy may raise concerns on academic integrity; however, policies should not punish students who did nothing wrong: the time zone students are in are not in their control. in contrast, the choice to adhere to the honor code and take the exam with honesty is in the hands of every student. in addition, student who decide to cheat in asynchronous exams is likely to cheat in synchronous section regardless, having no correlation with whether students learning from different time zones should have a fair time to take the exam. therefore, exam policies need to be changed so that every student has an equal opportunity to demonstrate their performance and a healthy schedule without late night classes.

*enforcement of policies*

after appropriate revision to the university policies, those policies need to be strictly enforced so that the students can benefit from those policies to have a flexible learning experience. if no enforcement is placed and no feedback channel is available for students, students would not be benefitted from those policies. thus, i recommend the university to establish ways for students to provide feedback and express concerns on remote teaching related to course policies to the administration level (independent to those mid-quarter survey that are for instructional feedback).

*attendance policy*

here, i present one example of the consequence of the lack of policy enforcement: the attendance policy is not practiced by instructors. the university policy on remote teaching has a clear guideline on grading synchronous attendance: “attendance – don’t factor in attendance as part of grading” \[3\]. however, many instructors still grade attendance directly or indirectly. take an organic chemistry course as an example, its grading takes synchronous poll everywhere responses as 4% of the total grade, stating that “you will only be able to answer the questions during lecture, not while watching the lectures on panopto later on,” forcing students to attend synchronously without considering students learning in different time zones. as a solution, i recommend quarterly inspection of course syllabus as a part of policy enforcement, in the hope that instructors will follow university policies, just like students should follow university policies, too.

**conclusion**

in conclusion, university policies need to be revised and enforced so that the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones can be protected. the change to university policies can also provide more equitable examination opportunities. i invite the uw administration to respond by taking concrete actions to improve the policies, building a more inclusive community.

"where did the valentine's cheap candy go? so, this is incredibly mundane, but feb 15th has always been a bright point in my winters-- valentines chocolates get marked way down after the holiday, and i'll usually buy a bunch of sweets to pep myself up.

1.  what type of essay is the department seeking for the first response? do  they want a list of my psych-related achievements (i've done a lot of  science fairs, 1 published article, 1 tedx talk, 1 psych conference talk  + poster, & a lot of panel talks)? an ""i knew i wanted to be a  therapist when..."" story? bulletpoints of how psychology is a theme in  my studies?

3.  i am entering as a freshman in autumn 2021, but will have enough  credits (because of running start) to bump up to junior status. i know  from reading this page that it's best/easiest to be admitted into the  major in the autumn. the psych major webpage currently says *""the application cycle for winter will open at some point during the week of march 22-26.""* is autumn admission into the major already closed? is it futile for me to try?

"questions on drinking/partying/social life/housing from an exchange student from the uk obvious covid disclaimer, any questions related to partying assume it'll be safe to do so next year.

i will (most likely) be studying as a junior at uw next year as an exchange student from the uk, and my only knowledge of drinking/partying/social life at us colleges comes from tv and movies so i've got like a dozen questions. male, will be 20 for most of the school year.

given the drinking age of 18, ""partying"" at uni in the uk involves just buying alcohol and drinking in halls, or going to university bars, or going to clubs/bars in the city (i live in london) like any adult. pretty standard at my uni at least would be clubbing or going to student bar 2-4 times a week. how does uw compare?

the consensus from previous posts seems to be that if you're not ""in the greek system"", as a guy you're not going to get into any frat parties. is this still/actually the case? also, what does ""in"" mean? do you have to actually be in a frat, or if you are friends with fraternity member(s) will you be able to reliably get onto guestlists? or is having friends get you on guestlists more of a sometimes works/sometimes doesn't thing?

if to reliably (like every week or fortnight) get into frat parties you actually have to be in a frat, is this an option for an exchange student? 

what are the non-frat options like? do people under 21 generally have fake ids and go to clubs/bars in the city? how common are non-frat house parties, and how is it to get into them? is it just a case of knowing people?

do most juniors/seniors live off-campus? i don't really want to have to try to organise private accom abroad, so assume i'll apply for halls/apartments, so would i live predominantly with people younger than me?

are any halls more/less social than others? (the reputation seems to change year by year from previous posts). what are apartments like, as in do they have staff, or can you just drink as if it were private accom?

"is it possible to transfer into the school of engineering from arts and sciences or should i give up i was a dumbfuck in high school and took running start courses without understanding that i needed to take particular classes to get into degrees. i had no idea what i wanted to do either, and thought i would use running start as a time to explore. i thought a transfer degree will get you into any major you like. my parents did nothing to change my view, and i had no college councilor at my school (i went to edmonds heights, anyone on here who knows what that is will probably understand how i ended up in this situation).

around this year i realized that i have consistently expressed interest in marine biology and engineering (as it relates to aerospace but i imagine i want something broad for career options). unfortunately, unless i spend two more years at cc, i won't be able to transfer into either of those. my experience with community college has been so poor that i would rather work a blue collar career instead of go back to community college if those were my choices.

my parents put into my head that i can enter any major i like after getting admitted into the uw, but then i realized my parents both have masters in philosophy, so perhaps i should have found someone else to provide me with college counseling. i submitted my application for chid, but i have no intention of getting a chid degree. is it possible for me to switch to engineering? what about the school of the environment? or should i just give up and find something more realistic.",advice

"thoughts on phys12x i've been hearing a lot about how awful the phys12x series has been in the last couple quarters, so if anyone is interested, here are some study tips for physics from an upperclassman.

note: i took phys121 and 122 in person, and 123 online. this advice applies to both cases, but focuses on characteristics of the class itself and not on the zoom experience.

&#x200b;

**stuff about the physics series that you probably know already (but if not, you really should):**

the intro physics series are some of the hardest classes to take while you're getting used to a college-level study routine...as you’ve probably noticed. it might help to hear that it's not just made that way to torture you and make the averages low. the material goes so fast because it's basically throwing an entire four years' worth of undergraduate physics at you in a condensed format. i think the idea is that you get exposure to all the topics, so when they reappear in your later classes, you're a little more familiar with them, even though they'll be reworked at a slower and clearer pace as you go more in-depth. is this a good policy? probably not, but that's how it is. sadly, we don't run the physics department and we have to work with what they give us.

all three classes in the series are tough, but it’s generally said that 121 is medium, 122 is hardest, and 123 is easiest. a lot of us find phys122 challenging mainly because a.) things don't make visual, intuitive sense like they do in mechanics, and b.) the transition from electricity to magnetism can catch you off guard. if you don't have a good grasp on electricity by the time you start magnetism, that's when things get really confusing. phys123 is probably the easiest just because it's a grab-bag of different topics, instead of units that build on each other. so, if you're lost on one topic, it's less of a catastrophic cascade event and more of an ""i can review this later"" situation.

it is (unfortunately) possible to spend hours and hours ""working on physics"" and not making any actual progress. (speaking from experience here.) you do need to build some good study habits and focus on understanding concepts before you do homework problems. bashing your head against a wall isn't going to earn you anything but a headache. it doesn't mean you're stupid or that you're bad at physics, just that you’re misdirecting your efforts, which is something you can improve on as you get experience.

&#x200b;

**homework:**

imo, mastering physics is the worst out of the evil trinity that is mastering, aleks, and webassign. that little progress bar in aleks might be demoralizing as hell, but mastering is the most likely to give you a homework problem in three parts with concepts building on each other and no way to check where you got the math wrong.

the advice that worked for me is this: never feel bad if the homework doesn't make sense immediately, and (seriously) don't try to brute force your way through a problem if you're stuck. if you haven't made progress for more than 15min, it's time to set that homework aside and hunt for a similar practice problem in the textbook, rewatch the lecture, or take the problem to clue/study center/office hours. you might be surprised at how much more efficient this is.

&#x200b;

**exams:**

you know that handy equation sheet pdf everyone gets? don't just use it on the exam - print it out asap and use it when you do the homework. making the equation sheet your friend is one of the easiest ways to speed up your problem-solving. get familiar with where the equations are located on the sheet, annotate it if you need to, and you'll be much less likely to overlook the equation you needed or plug it in incorrectly on a midterm or final.

an annoying decision from the physics department is that you only receive two practice tests per exam, but clue gives out more, and lots of students might have extras that were available from past years because of friends/siblings who took the class previously. it's a stupid system - you shouldn't need to network just to get access to study materials. maybe you all can push the department to end that policy. boycott them or something, i don't know.

&#x200b;

**office hours:**

go to office hours. that is all. if you already understand why this is important, you don't need to keep reading. if you need convincing, here are some thoughts:

* if you're confused about a thing, you may as well ask the person who has a phd in that thing to explain it to you. (i remember being in e-fig and being told that it's better to go to clue/study centers before bothering your professors. that is a fat lie. get the information from the source.)
* even if your professor's lecture style doesn't really make sense to you, you can still learn a lot from office hours because you're able to ask questions or hear other students ask questions. if you really don't like your professor, at least try going to office hours with another one - there are usually multiple professors teaching each intro class.
* a lot of professors will actually work through problems step-by-step if you ask them to. hint hint: this is good for those tough mastering physics problems.
* if nothing else, go to office hours on the week of the exam. your professor is likely to give you hints on what will be covered.
* networking!!! it is completely possible to take a huge weedout class like phys12x and have your professor remember your name, one year and several hundred students later, when she's worried about the midterm averages in her current classes and thinks advice from a student might do some good. (busted; yes, i was asked to write this. see? your professors do care.) why does she remember me? she wrote me a recommendation letter that helped me land a summer research gig. why did she do that? you guessed it; i went to office hours.

&#x200b;

i think i'm done ranting, but while we're at it, here are three online resources that may help you out if you don't use them already:

1. **course evaluation catalogue:** it's like rate my professor, but less salt. may give you a better sense of the average student's experience. [https://www.washington.edu/assessment/course-evaluations/cec/](https://www.washington.edu/assessment/course-evaluations/cec/)
2. **dubhub**: see the average grade distributions per class, per professor. [https://www.dubhub.pub/](https://www.dubhub.pub/)
3. **libgen:** free textbooks. use it. it will save you money. not in phys12x, because pearson is viciously protective of its copyrights, but definitely in other classes. [https://libgen.is/](https://libgen.is/)

"quick chance me on cs acceptance not entirely sure if this is really done here but i'd like to see where i stand in getting admitted for cs as decisions come out in a few days. i'm applying as a freshman.

* in-state
* 10th grader/15 years old
* no act/sat

in-state community college coursework:

\- cs 141 and 143 (java i and ii)

\- linear algebra, calculus 3, diff eq.

\- second-year physics i

\- english 101 and 235

\- bunch of other stuff that probably won't matter too much

my gpa is pretty good, but they don't really check that as it's ""extra."" kinda sucks considering i've taken more college courses than high school classes.

high school:

\- 4.0

\- 3 aps in my freshman year (calc bc, human geo, ap bio)

\- 2 years of latin (latin 2 was the only class i took my sophomore year)

so essentially, my question is, since i’m able to s/ns for covid, if i were to s/ns this class for an ns (after grades are released and i’m below a 1.8), i won’t have a number/letter grade. since i won’t have a letter grade of course i know that i’ll have to retake it next year, but without an actual letter/number grade below a 1.8, can this prevent me from being put on probation? i would, if possible, try to petition to get my number grade back once i’ve retaken it but for now, is this possible?",academics

"hcde: graduate school? hi everyone,

i wanted to post this question because i feel that i get many mixed responses regarding graduate school for people going into the ux field. as an undergrad in the hcde program, i was considering applying for the department's masters program, but i'm worried about the prospect of paying off student loans that i feel will accumulate too much over time (note: im a oos student). 

a lot of people i've talked to say that graduate school is unnecessary, particularly in the ux field, and developing a strong portfolio is much preferred. however, my question is that wouldn't going to graduate school strengthen your overall portfolio and resume? additionally, when searching for careers, it seems many of the positions seek for people with more work experience and preferably a degree higher than that of a bs. i feel that i would stand no chance compared to much more experienced candidates with refined portfolios when it comes to the competition for jobs. 

it also seems that much of the ""prestige"" of the hcde dept. lies in their master's programs as i can't seem to find too much information regarding the bachelor's program. maybe i'm wrong. but, i just feel really lost about this subject because i've really yet to figure out my career track, let alone figure out if graduate school is something i should consider. i'm panicking because i'm going to be a junior soon, and i have no idea what i want to do with my degree or have even started a solid portfolio. 

for hcde people, how difficult was it to find a job, particularly with a bs degree? is graduate school worth the financial investment? for those going into hcde ms program, why did you choose to do so? what differences are there in bs and ms programs for hcde? do you have any advice on how to get started on your portfolio early?

"living in seattle on phd stipend hi all,

i'm so thrilled to share that i've been offered admission into a phd program with a full funding package which covers my tuition and health insurance. it also offers a generous stipend (around 2k after tax deductions). now that the admission formalities are taking their own sweet time, i started exploring the student life in seattle (online, of course!). 

seattle is a great city but equally expensive! so i'm looking for suggestions/tips/references/ted-talk/magic of the current grad students on how they manage their expenses in seattle.

"impostor syndrome vs. just not being in the right environment i see a lot of students bolstering each other by calling impostor syndrome at everything. i find that toxic, to be honest — not in a way that is purposefully or intrinsically harmful, but a lot like “toxic positivity”. you’re trying to be helpful, but it actually does the opposite.

i think that every student should (and usually does) have a deep moment of reflection when things are continuously not going well. sometimes, really great things come from it! people change their majors and their gpa shoots up and they find themselves happier and more passionate with their field. sometimes, people take a quarter off. sometimes, people transfer colleges. and sometimes, at an extreme, people drop out - whether it be to pursue an independent affair, preserve their mental health, take care of their finances, or re-think their academic and career goals.

not every instance of self-doubt is impostor syndrome, and i don’t think we should brush everything off as such. i think we should be having deeper conversations, self-reflections, and explorations. 

it might seem right to placate your friends from the outset with “easy” explanations, but we should be honest and reflective with the people we care about more often. and, of course, a lot of the time, i’m sure that it probably is imposter syndrome.

if you're a freshman or sophomore (or honestly anyone this applies to) at uw, and you're not doing as well as you thought you would because you were a straight-a student in hs, but for some reason, you can't seem to perform as well at uw, this post is for you.

i am currently a junior majoring in engineering, and these are my grades for this quarter. it might be hard to believe, but my gpa for my first quarter at uw as a freshman was a whopping 2.23, with two out of the three classes with a gpa of below 2.0, i felt stupid, incompetent, and embarrassed. i thought that since hs was a breeze for me, college would be the same. i never needed any type of help in hs, so reaching out for help was never something i was comfortable with, along with my flawed studying habits i was also working 25-30 hours a week. this continued for a couple more quarters with me cutting down my work hours to 13 hours a week, while i was trying to figure out how to succeed at uw, until i eventually ended up being on academic probation, and at risk of losing my dtc engr status. i thought it was over, and maybe i should just drop out. but i didn't. i decided to quit my job and work my ass off devoting all of my time to studying, as well as reaching out for help whenever i needed help. my grades started to slowly go up, and eventually, here we are.

the moral of the story is to reach out for help, don't be embarrassed, reach out to your professors, tas, advisors, classmates, and tutors, they are there to help you succeed. adjust your studying habits to help you succeed in your courses, stop prioritizing things that aren't important (for me, it was my part-time job at a grocery store).

don't give up, you've got this, i believe in you!

"university gpa before military service and applying afterwards first, i apologize for bringing up what has likely been plastered all over this sub with varying personal context.

for background, after high school graduation, i applied and was accepted to the university of arizona. through a complete and utter lack of motivation and self discipline, i preformed extremely poorly, ultimately withdrawing after 2 years. i joined the navy almost immediately afterwards to take some of the burden off of my parents, who were supporting me entirely financially, as well as my younger brothers who were just starting college themselves.

&#x200b;

my military service gave me plenty of time to figure out what i was doing with myself and how i could fix what went wrong before. as banal as it sounds, i believe i've been able to build a foundation of self respect and work ethic that i didn't have before i enlisted and i want to prove that to myself by going back to and finishing a degree.

because of my previous performance at the ua and the impression of me that my transcript would undoubtedly give, i'm admittedly very nervous of the fact that my application could be rejected due to my shortcomings in the past. my plan is to go to a wa cc for 2 years before applying as a transfer student to the uw with the intention of maintaining a competitive gpa there.

have any of you had a similar experience with doing poorly either in high school or otherwise and successfully applying? what are the chances that my previous grades would keep me from being accepted regardless of how well i do at cc? are there any specific steps i should take beyond putting my full effort into my gpa to improve my chances?

"in need of housing 2021-2022 help so me and my friend are planning on moving in to the dorms in the fall of this year, but we have some questions. we’ll be sophomores in the fall & we’ve never lived on campus. 

we have a few questions regarding housing as applications are coming up:

1) is it better to have two or three roommates? pricing wise, it’s definitely cheaper to have 3, but is it a good idea? especially since we don’t know anyone as of now who is looking for a 3 person dorm, we’d likely have to find someone who we don’t know to move in with us. should we stick to us 2 living together and pay extra, or find a 3rd roommate to pay less?

2) are any halls better than others, and would you suggest north or west campus? pricing looks to be the same for all halls, and the “amenities” are all that’s different (such as a gym vs a grocery store). we’re wanting a private bathroom for sanitary reasons so with that in mind, which hall would be the best, if any?
    - or should we get an apartment? money is a pretty     big focus of ours, we’re trying to save as much money as possible.
• also, if we were to do the apartment, how would this work if we went home for summer?

3) is there a dining plan level requirement? is there a minimum level we have to buy based on the hall we chose + the price of the hall?",advice

"dual-enrollment credits hello,

i am a first-year student recently admitted into uw for the class of 2025 (oos and pre-sciences). 

if i were to come to uw, i would have several credits from dual-enrollment and ap exams. 

i am looking for a major like cs, but i am willing to make do with other majors such as informatics, statistics, or acms (main target, probably dm & a or stats track).

since i would be applying to capacity-constrained majors, i was wondering how my ap exams/dual-enrollment courses would play out when i applied to majors, and how it would affect my uw transcript as a whole.

specifically, if i have a 4 on my ap computer science a exam, would it count as a 'b' on my uw transcript as ap cs a covers cse 142 at uw? 

if i have b's on some of my dual enrollment classes, will they negatively affect my chances of getting a major like the ones i stated above?

idk if this will help, but here's a list of the dual-enrollment courses/ap exams i would be coming with: 

ap calculus ab and bc (5, 5)

ap physics 1 & 2 (5, 4)

ap u.s. history (5)

ap statistics (5)

ap computer science a (4)

dual enrollment (de anza college in cupertino): calculus iii (math 1c), multivariable calculus (math 1d), linear algebra (math 2b), discrete mathematics (math 22), python programming (cis 41a), physics for scientists and engineers (kind of like ap physics c: mechanics, phys 4a), human biology (biol 11), data abstractions and structures (cis 22c).

i'd originally planned on just taking japan 203 this quarter, but i later changed my mind. however, when i asked again recently, the instructor raised concerns about starting directly from japan 301 due to the length of time since i'd last taken japanese classes, saying that it would probably be too difficult.

i know my screw-up probably could've been avoided if i'd simply asked earlier. could anyone give any advice on what i should do from here on out?

i could take the 2nd-year intensive over the coming summer, but i transferred into uw with a lot of credits, so i'm worried that doing so would push me to the credit ceiling much sooner. alternatively, i could just take japan 203 next spring.

would it be worth trying to convince the instructor to let me take japan 301, or is this a bad idea? while i haven't been actively studying during the gap, i've still managed to retain most of my vocabulary, listening comprehension, and reading/writing due to a combination of using anki fairly intensively back in the day and semi-regular usage. if i go down this route, i would be devoting a lot of time this quarter and over the summer to reviewing.",advice

incoming freshman here. 
i'm considering north campus dorms...

out of the 6 dorms, 4 are extremely similar in pricing and dorm layout... and i'm not too sure about these 4 cuz a 4 person or 3 person suite i feel is pretty small and not worth it??? the doubles and singles here are just outta my reach :(

*i'm not striking of these 4 options, still considering them*

so the remaining two are hansee and mcmahon.

♤ in hansee, i'm considering a 3 person suite which is 6k per year. i just want to know your opinions. 

i've heard hansee is very quiet and everyone is not that social??? but a 3 person suite will be more social i think?
do many freshmen live in hansee?

also it has a bicycle storage room (unlike mcmahon) inside which is a big plus for me. i plan to get a cycle to go to class as well as for recreation.

♤ in mcmahon, i'm looking at the double room which is 7k per year.

i've heard mcmahon is very social due to the cluster system. do many freshmen live in mcmahon?

there is no cycle storage... we have to keep it outside the bldg on the rails... very likely to be stolen.

☆☆☆ the thing is i like quiet environments to some extent, where i can focus on academics... not extremely noisy and stuff.
hansee and mcmahon seem to be on two extreme ends. i believe some sociability is important which a 3 or 4 person suite in hansee will facilitate???☆☆☆

"an outsider’s thoughts on the asuw stuff i know there’s been a ton of dialogue on asuw and the daily drama recently so i thought i’d join in. 

first, i’m an incoming freshman so i’m not a student at uw yet. i don’t fully understand everything around this issue but from the information i’ve gathered i’ve come to the following conclusions:

1) the asuw president overstepped by sending out that mass email. i’m a bit up in the air on whether she should be recalled but i think i’m leaning towards the opinion that she should.
2) i’m very disappointed in the asuw as an institution. they don’t seem to reflect the student body and i would like to see some reforms put in place to ensure representatives actually represent the students.
3) the asuw needs to stop complaining and start getting stuff done. college is way way way too expensive and the asuw should organize around bringing this cost down and improving the quality of life for students. 
4) the daily’s cartoon wasn’t racist. it was just a list of campus landmarks and was in no way tied to candidates. if, however, the daily had drawn that cartoon so that the landmarks each corresponded to a specific candidate so that the animals corresponded to bipoc candidates, that’d be racist. 

that’s just my 2 cents that nobody asked for. i might run for asuw next year just to raise these issues ngl

"list of a potential violation by asuw's bod president camille hattwig to start with, i am an incoming graduate student from out-of-state with no involvement in asuw, however, i do have multiple years of experience serving in my undergraduate university's student governments. after reading the recent situation with asuw and the daily, i believe camille hattwig and any other officers involved in the sending of the mass email, should face some consequences for their targeted harassment and bully behavior. i have compiled a basic list of *potential* violations. the elections rules seem to be applicable if is she is affiliated with or advocates for any of the candidates, but i included them in case y'all know more about her campaign involvement. i make no guarantees that any of these necessarily apply, but i do believe publishing a list is necessary for anybody wanting to make a complaint. here's a list of potential violations:

&#x200b;

from the [asuw constitution](http://records.asuw.org/getdecision.php?id=5):

article 8 § 4a: ""the student senate has the power to consider and approve resolutions of student opinion, which stand as the official opinion of the asuw in the manner prescribed by this section. **no other body of the asuw may formulate official\* asuw student opinion.**"" \*see below

&#x200b;

from the [asuw bylaws](http://records.asuw.org/getdecision.php?id=6):

article 1 § 2g: ""\[the president shall\] serve as the **official** spokesperson of the asuw in campus, community, and inter-school relationships;""

article 1 § 2t: ""\[the president shall\] handle major public relations efforts with national and local press **in coordination with the communications director**;"" did she coordinate with the communications director first?

&#x200b;

from the [asuw communications policy](http://comm.asuw.org/files/2018/10/current-asuw-communications-policy-edited-spring-2018.pdf):

section 4 § 1e: ""asuw employees remain expected to use their assigned asuw email accounts to communicate with individuals and entities external to the asuw."" instead of using her personal email to share her individual opinion, her use of the main asuw email account for the accusations suggests it was an official communication.

section 5 § 3.b.ii: ""**no negative language about any group, person, or entity shall ever be posted by any entity or initiative pages associated with the asuw**.""

&#x200b;

from the [2021 elections policies and procedures](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/):

section 5 § 6: ""no asuw employee, volunteer, appointee, entity, or committee may make endorsements in their official capacity such as using their title or position; and no asuw equipment or supplies, including employment time or office hours, phones, office machines, office space, and email accounts, may be used for campaign purposes, except as authorized by the eac. any candidate or ballot measure advocate receiving an endorsement from an asuw employee, volunteer, or appointee in personal capacity must, when campaigning with such endorsement, clearly state that such endorsement is in the individual’s personal capacity only.""

section 6 § 2.2: ""\[campaigning includes\] addressing crowds to promote or oppose a ballot measure or candidate.""

section 6 § 2.5: ""\[campaigning includes\] use of electronic or social media to publicly promote or oppose a ballot measure or candidate.""

section 6 (weird formatting): ""candidates, affiliates, and ballot measure advocates may not campaign while acting in an official capacity of the asuw.""

section 6 § 3.7: ""\[no candidate, candidate’s affiliate, ballot measure advocate, or ballot measure advocate’s affiliate may, in the course of campaigning\] **use electronic media to interfere with the neutrality of the ballot**...""

section 6 § 3.10: ""**violating any applicable law, whether federal, state, or local is a severe violation.**"" depending on how liberally you interpret her email and the laws, one *could* argue it was a libel against the daily as an organization.

section 7 § 8.7: ""\[no candidate, candidate’s affiliate, ballot measure advocate, or ballot measure advocates affiliate may\] **use any force, threat or unlawful means to hinder or deter any voter from voting, or to obtain a vote for or against any candidate or ballot measure**.""

section 9 § 6: ""**liability exists for even unintentional or unknowing violations**, unless intent or knowledge is an essential element of the provision violated.""

section 10 § 4.2: ""**\[complaints may allege a violation by\] an entity of the asuw**.""

&#x200b;

to conclude, this is not a personal vendetta against camille. i do think, as someone who cares about student body representation and making serious, progressive change, her actions as an asuw official should warrant repercussions as outlined by asuw's governing documents. if you are making a complaint, please follow the procedures laid out in [section 11](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/). **please do not harass or violate the privacy of anyone!**",student life
"should i commit to uw? hi everyone! high school senior here. tomorrow is college decision day, and i'm feeling really nervous. i feel like everyone has already committed and i'm one of the few who haven't.

as of right now, i'm currently deciding between uw and wwu. i want to major in either cs or biology, and i know about the whole ""don't come to uw if you want to do cs"", but i was accepted to the stars program at uw (which is a 2-year program that guarantees you placement into an engineering major). however, i was also accepted into a cs scholars program at wwu. in the end, i don't know which college i want to attend because both have their consequences and benefits.

**uw pros:** stars program, better location (45-minute drive from home), my dream school, very generous aid (so i won't have loans or debt)

**uw cons:** stars program won't accept running start college credits (plus bc of the program itself, i'll have to go to school for 5 years), more academically rigorous, a bigger school so not sure if it's the right environment for me, got an f in a class so *possible* rescindment/probation? (admissions said that failing a class isn't usually something they rescind for, but it's case-by-case)

**wwu pros:** cs scholars program, smaller school, will accept running start credits, less competitive

**wwu cons**: location (about 2-hour drive from home), offering me 17k in financial aid (coa is about 26k), not as prestigious (not sure how much that really matters)

my parents are encouraging me to apply for the graduate student housing on campus, and i'm not sure how to feel about it.  i lived on campus for all 4 years of undergrad, so even though the grad student housing are apartments, i still feel like i'm trying to put off being an adult by living on campus *again*.  additionally, (and this sounds really stupid) i wouldn't be able to have a pet, and that makes me sad.  literally one of the things that got me through being away from home during undergrad was looking at pictures of my cat and reminding myself that i'm seeing her again in x amount of weeks.  especially since i'm moving cross-country, i feel like having a cat to cuddle or something when (if?) i get homesick will really help me mentally.

i'm legally disabled, so i *technically* qualify for an emotional support animal (esa).  the worst part of my disability is the mental toll that can come with it, so an esa would help some in that regard.  however, looking at the uw housing website, it seems i have to not only have a current relationship with an animal in order to register it as an esa (so, i couldn't adopt a pet and *then* register it as an esa), but when i apply, i have to be ready to submit documentation for disability requests.  i *could* register my cat as an esa, but she's almost 12 years old and i literally do not think she would survive a move from atlanta to seattle. so, based on all this, i don't think i'd be able to live on campus and have a pet (if i'm wrong and someone else knows more about the esa process, please correct me!).

current uw students (graduate *or* undergrad), what do y'all think?  i'm still trying to weigh being happy but cash-strapped vs being more financially secure but longing for things i couldn't have if i lived on campus.",advice
"anyone here like making music? i'll be straight with you: i haven't been able to develop much of a social life at this school. covid struck  right as i was starting to climb out of my shell, and meeting with rsos through zoom just hasn't been working for me.

anywho, i'm now living around north campus, and i spend most of my time writing and producing music (i play guitar, drums, and make digital music), and aggressively studying japanese, which i'm also super passionate about.

if any of that sounds cool to you, please don't hesitate to hit me up. i am eager to collaborate or even just chill and get high or play minecraft or call of duty or something. just looking to make the rest of this quarter a little less solitary.

class apathy i want to care about my classes and schoolwork but i just don't. i always do what i need to do to get good grades in the end but i'm just so bored and tired of it all. any advice for not hating/getting more invested in my classes? :(,academics
"why is gh 101 so hard? dont take?! quick rant/advice for people who are going to take this class. i find gh 101 to be extremely difficult and as someone who has taken weed-out courses at the uw, i don't understand why the staff is being so unhelpful. we have weekly quizzes worth 10% of our grade but they're just fine. for some reason my ta finds a reason to take a couple points off each assignment for a little reason like spacing, formatting, or something related to not answering the whole question even though there's only 150 words and i mentioned all of the different factors like structural adjustment programs. i don't know why they're treating a 100 level class like a 400 level one, and believe me i've taken 400 level global/public health classes. the weekly assignment are super time consuming and it would be nice of them to make them more creative to do. or clarify their high expectations. 

also, i just looked it up, but the professor has like 1.9/5 reviews on rate my professor which makes sense considering how i see more of my tas than the the professor, and all of the lectures are online lectures with a speaker talking over the slides which are photos. besides tuesdays lectures, you never even see the professors or get feedback/advice/help from them which i understand! they are just active on the discussion board. and yes they seem like nice people just not good professors. also, i don't think they create a very inclusive environment for poc but that's another thing. racism in the healthcare field is also an important topic to discuss. if i'm sounding negative i apologize, it's just that i expected more from the class and i'm putting in a lot of work in the readings taking notes and the lectures. i've also attended office hours but my ta doesn't give me advice on how to improve or what their looking for. i enjoyed global health before taking this class, and unless they change the structure, i wouldn't recommend it for incoming freshman or anyone interested in global health majors or minors.",academics

i'm currently a freshman engrud hoping for meche placement in the fall. since meche requires amath 301, i figured i should consider doing the optional replacement for math 20x with the amath 35x series which would guarantee me the amath minor with no extra work (assuming i'm placed into meche). i have some questions about the difference between the two different tracks, though. i was wondering what is the difficulty difference between amath and math for these series, as well as if amath 351 requires knowledge of python/matlab yet. i was planning to take amath 351 this summer since almost any engineering placement i'm interested in allows for it to fill a grad requirement, and then taking amath 301 in the fall since it isn't a guarantee i'll need that course if i don't get into meche. does amath 351 rely on python/matlab knowledge, or is it fairly similar to math 207 (307)? thanks in advance!",academics

"prereq flow: 1 month update for those who missed it the first time, [prereq flow](https://prereq-flow.vercel.app/) ([source code](https://github.com/awu43/prereq-flow)) is a website i made that visualizes uw undergraduate course prerequisites.

in the month since then i've made a ton of improvements and added more features/data, including two suggestions from when i first posted it:

* there's now an option for a new flow with only courses from a specific curriculum e.g. amath (from /u/jimsupawish).

* bothell/tacoma courses and curricula are now available (from /u/endendragon).

some remaining problems:

* how to implement either/or logic in the graph. this is a big one, and will probably take a while.

* positioning when adding new courses or using undo/redo is still buggy.

* no tests, so there are definitely more bugs out there that i haven't found yet.

* adding just engineering degrees was already annoying so i'm not adding any more degree data on my own, but i haven't figured out a system for user submissions (opening a bunch of random email attachments is definitely a bad idea).

"random advice for freshmen here is a random jumble of advice and info i wish i knew/thought of before coming to uw (much of this is dorm related)

 

* 8 am in high school is very different from 8 am in college. unless you are absolutely sure that you are a morning person--like the type of person who wakes up at 6 a.m.--do not take classes before 10 a.m.! 
* get the lowest level dining account. if you find you need more money you can always level your account up, but if you start with an expensive dining account and you don't spend the money, you're screwed.
* you might not like your roommates. it's fine. even if you talk to them for months before, sometimes it just doesn't work out and that's okay. it happens to a lot of people.
* closet measurements: that rack for hanging your clothes is 32 inches. (hope this helps y'all not overpack)
* worried about storage space? grab yourself one of these bad boys at a very reasonable price from target: https://www.target.com/p/11-8-cube-organizer-shelf-room-essentials-153/-/a-51256587?preselect=15113339#lnk=sametab 
* don't know who needs to hear this, but you do not need to bring that many pairs of shoes. 
* bring several towels. ideally thinner ones so they dry properly.
* clothes you *need*:  a good rain jacket. ideally two. two pairs of rain shoes, either waterproof or water-resistant. that's right, you will thank me for this.
* don't bring tide pods. the washers don't get hot enough for them to melt. 
* bringing posters? scotch mounting putty works great for hanging them on dorm walls! tape… not so much. 
* get a minifridge, get a good one! you do not really need a microwave, every dorm floor has two microwaves so you're not going to have to walk super forward to access a fancy and high-quality microwave. 
* you will in fact need a power cord--the outlets are few and far spread so if you plan on having a lamp, your computer, a clock, and phone plugged in at your desk, you will need this. 
* buy one of those eye masks for sleeping and practice sleeping in it. well look stupid and it's not the most comfortable at first, you and your roommate will thank me when it's 2 a.m. and you want to sleep, and they need to have the lights on so they can stay awake and cram study for a test.  no matter the brightness or what time of day it is, you put that sucker on, and it's pitch black and perfect for sleeping.
* there is no ac in the dorms. you have a heater in your room but the highest i can go is 74 degrees. it autoshuts on at 55 degrees. thus far it has not gotten hot enough that i would want ac but just a heads up it isn't an option.
* bring lights. lamps, string lights, anything. the dorm lighting sucks and the rooms are so gloomy, dark, and depressing. 
* there will be very little daylight during the winter months. some days, if you sleep in late and wake up at 3 p.m, you open your blinds to find it is already dark outside. during these months make sure you get up and experience a few hours of sunlight a day or you will get seasonal depression. it's very real, and it sucks. 
* aleks is evil. learn to fear and hate the name, chances are you'll understand later. 
* sometimes there are homeless people wandering around west campus. most of them are chill, some of them are weird. sometimes the front of the dorm buildings smells like human urine.
* the dining hall food sucks. buy yourself a pan, pot, spatula, knife, mixing bowl, and cutting board from target or ikea or somewhere in case you ever cook. that's honestly about all you need....
* bring a vacuum. and a duster. the dorm's floors get so dirty so fast, and the room gets so damn dusty from the vents. 
* do not overload your schedule! college classes are a lot more self-taught than high school. balance is important, for everyone hard class you're taking, balance it with a passion class or a fun class your first quarter to allow yourself breathing room to adjust. pair your chem class with a film appreciation class or psychology of human sexuality, and your bio class with ceramics or creative writing. you get the idea.
* do not hook up with someone on your dorm hall floor, rookie mistake and it is awkward for the whole year. i did not do it but i know too many people who did eek
* spreadsheet, spreadsheet, spreadsheet! canvas and it's annoying to use in my opinion, the only way i kept from forgetting assignments as i spent hours the first day of school making a spreadsheet ordering all the assignments, tests, quizzes, and projects to speak to a spreadsheet organized by date. then throughout the quarter i just stayed ahead and crossed stuff off the list.",advice

background: i did well and really enjoyed in ap chem in hs (got credit for 142 and 152, but have to retake sequence for med school) did honors physics and 1 quarter of ap physics mechanics (which i didn’t like but was ok at). i am finishing intro bio series this quarter. i want to be able to take the mcat at the end of junior year, so i should be done with gen chem, physics, o chem, and bio chem by end of junior year. 

what i “should” do: take accelerated chem (143/153) this year &amp; and physics 114 sequence. next year take o chem and bio chem. this is think workload-wise makes the most sense, right?

what i want to do: take honors chem (1x5 sequence) this year, o chem and bio chem junior year, and maybe phys 114 sequence next year? or this year?

i was looking into honors chem and honestly it really speaks to me content-wise - i got really excited. i’m not worried so much about the difficulty, rather the work load. if i did honors, when should i take physics? and should i just not do honors and do the more reasonable accelerated sequence?

sorry this is really long if you read this thank you you’re awesome. 

also to any other pre-med kids out there, if you take med school pre-reqs you will be only 1-2 chem courses away from a chem minor (depending on if you take reg vs accelerated/honors chem sequence)

i’m also considering a bike or a penny board to make things quicker but idk yet.

i am also on the waitlist for a couple ucs and am waiting on decision letters from two german colleges. both of these would be financially way better for me, but i enrolled at uw for now because its my best guaranteed option....but when do i start paying tuition for uw? if it happens before i know whether i got into any of these other places, that would suck.

"rc student questions i just got accepted to the uw robinson center program as a freshman for 2021. i had some questions about the point of the rc in general.   
1) are students that take the rc program really ahead of their peers in high school? it seems that rc path is basically the same as running start. what is the point of taking rc if it doesn't even give the student an advantage on completing an undergrad program?  
2) rc students need to take 1 year of ""transition"" to achieve 105 credits and 5 quarters before being able to declare a major. i think this factors the required cadrs not completed in high school. is this normal for all uw freshman to need 105 credits before declaring a major? am i literally paying a year's worth of college for high school credits??  


3) i read that if you're not a direct admit, then there is no point going to the computer science route. as a rc student, i can't be counted as a direct admit because i can't even declare a major until after 1-2 years. how will being a rc student affect my chances?  


i am super confused and disillusioned at the prospect of this since rc never really described all the cons of the program. maybe i'm just being dumb but if everything i said above is true, then i don't understand the point of rc. i know that uw is a really good computer science school, but i don't see the advantages of rc over running start, or just finishing 2 years and applying to mit or stanford. any help is appreciated! i feel so lost.",advice

"where to find award accept/reject for financial aid? i was recently accepted as a transfer student to uw seattle, and as i expected it’s been pretty difficult to get in touch with the financial aid office (i’m sure this time of year it’s pretty chaotic for them). i received an email notification that my financial aid package was ready to view. i went to myuw and navigated to the financial aid status page, and there’s a message telling me to select the award accept/reject button in the menu. 

i’ve searched high and low and cannot find it anywhere. do these things take time to be set up? am i crazy?

thanks in advance! i’m hoping i just missed it somewhere but i’ve been looking for a couple days now and have yet to get an answer from the financial aid office that isn’t “well just click on it.” if anyone else is having this problem, that would honestly settle my worries. thanks, all!",admissions
"advice for grad student housing hey everyone, 

i’m a grad/mpacc student starting this fall. i’ve been looking at apartments and applied for a complex in north seattle (bitter lake area ¿?). i was accepted and have the lease agreement, but haven’t signed yet.

i’ve been looking into it a lot more and i’m questioning whether or not i should sign the lease because 1) i’ve been reading questionable things about the area, 2) the rent is ~1,600 w/o utilities and 3) it’s a bit of a drive to uw, i think around 20 mins with traffic.

the apartment itself is pretty nice, a 1br with a balcony and such, i’m just worried whether or not it’s worth the drive and i really don’t know anything about the area, or if i can find something cheaper/closer to uw.

do any of you have insights into the area and should i look into other apartments? and if i should, do you have any specific apartment suggestions?

just want you to know you’re the best ta i have ever had. you’re kind, patient, always available, knowledgeable, prepared, professional, fun, and helpful. you care so much about your students’ learning and success. your passion in chemistry helped me grow my passion for chemistry. 

your powerpoint slides are more than amazing. they’re really artistic and informational. the examples you gave in class to connect chemistry to real world problems and industry made the class enjoyable. i can’t imagine how much time and effort you put into those slides.

you always replied email so quickly and with detailed explanation. there was one time i emailed you at 1 pm asking a question about the lab, you not only replied immediately and answered my question but also said ‘go to sleep, don’t stay up late’. it just shows how friendly and caring you are as a ta.

for our final project, you had made such an effective learning environment. i just can’t imagine how you would meet one-on-one with more than 20 students every week to chat about our progress. my friends in other sections said they were put into groups of 5-6 to talk about their project. you also made the project so enjoyable by creating a kahoot game instead of making us presenting.

on top of all the above, you did all of those with your passion for teaching and cares for your students. i know you’re a first year grad student, who is busy with taking classes, doing research, and life. 

i wish everyone could have you as a ta. 

thank you for a great quarter!",academics

1) taking off summer quarter because i need a break to reset
2) making sure i have no roommates this next year (i've had some awful ones)
3) going to see a therapist for mental health issues

"i'm genuinely not okay hi dubfam. i hope summer's been going well for you guys.

this post is going to be all over the place because i don't even know where to start in terms of remedying my situation (i think it's hopeless to be honest, but i've got to get this all off my chest) so i'm very sorry in advance.

the 2020-2021 year was my freshman year at uw. since i had come in from a highly competitive public school in california with a history of nearly all a's, i did not think that this year would turn out the way that it did. though it's no excuse, i would say that my experience with having to adapt to college life in the context of a life-changing pandemic had significant repercussions on my mental health, and so my academics have been beyond poor in my opinion for the entirety of the year.

autumn quarter ended with a 3.6 in my bioe intro class (i'm not dtc either, hence why i wholeheartedly believe i've now sentenced myself to go nowhere in life) but i decided to s/ns the rest of my classes that term (rest were s's). i thought that would be the end of my dissatisfaction with my performance, but winter quarter took a turn for the worst—i failed all of my classes that quarter, got on academic probation, and subsequently chose to retake the winter courses for the spring term, which i now deem to be a fuck-up as well (2.8, 3.0, and 0.0/r).

i was considering making use of the former quarter drop (fqd) policy for winter quarter because my performance was especially poor; sometime near midterm season, i was roofied and consequently hospitalized—i actually almost passed away (which caused a lot of psychological trauma) but, given the nature of the situation, i feel as if the circumstances are a bit murky and so i've been hesitant to follow through with the entirety of the petition process because i feel like it'll all be in vain.

i'm so sorry for the pathetic ranting but i am truly broken at this point and i am thinking of ending it. i'm not even able to register for autumn 2021 at this point because of administrative holds. honestly, i'm not too sure about what my intentions even are with this post—part of me is desperately searching for reassurance and hope, but i'm crying myself to sleep every night because i know that not only is engineering completely out of the question, but that i'll most likely have to drop out. this is not who i am. i used to be an honor roll student in high school but now i'm on my own with all of my financial aid revoked, planning out how i'm going to leave my family and friends without hurting them too much.

edit: i've already began the process of trying to lift my registration/financial holds by speaking with my adviser but it's all still... so hopeless

changes since last month:

* more context menu options

* new minimap

* new ability to edit course data

* new option to add courses from text search, which should make it easy to add batches of electives/concentration courses.

* new course table to view all course data in one place.

* added natural sciences, environmental, and informatics majors. but, i'm pretty sure the [data](https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) is outdated, so check before using.

* updated [degree course lists](https://github.com/awu43/prereq-flow-degrees) with course names.

what's still missing:

* grouping — unfortunately, the library i'm using to generate the graphs doesn't support grouping at the moment so there's no easy way to represent a condition like ""10 credits from approved electives"".

"anyone registered for biol 310? and how? i'm a senior, and a bio major, and have decent priority because of pre-existing credits; i think the only people who registered before me are graduating seniors. i've tried and failed every quarter of every year at uw to register for biol 310 (anatomy is one of the only classes i'm actually really interested in/excited for, even if it's difficult. i'm in the physiology option and it seems odd that any kind of anatomy course isn't in our core curriculum).

"sap and financial aid (dropping summer qtr) hi, i’m currently taking summer qtr full-time because i thought i could do it (and financial aid requires i do full-time if i wanted aid). but now it’s proven to be really difficult. after a small injury in my family, it’s led to a lot of responsibility piled onto me. so doing summer qtr is the last thing on my mind. however, after emailing the office of financial aid, they told me that if i drop, my eligibility for aid could be taken away?? they also told me i should do a sap appeal then proceeded to not answer my questions.

i’m really really anxious about this because i really can’t take the time to do summer quarter and everything else that’s been added on. i also can’t afford to lose my financial aid. how would this process work if i were to drop all of my classes as a financial aid recipient?

"in state college or uw? uw is my dream school and i accepted my offer for fall 2021. while i've been planning on going to uw for the last 3 years, i can't ignore the debt that it would put me in, especially being an out of state student. yet i keep getting opportunities to have a cheap tuition if i attend a college in my state, which sounds wonderful, but not as wonderful as attending my dream school. 

i've bought uw merch, visited seattle just so i can get a glimpse of uw life, bragged, came to terms with pre majors and weed off classes, made uw friends, and already found roommates and an off campus apartment to live in. 
but i'd be financially restricted going to uw, i wouldn't be able to enjoy a life aside from college like travelling here and there or during the summer.

 but then there's the option to attend college where i live for two years then transfer to uw and my debt wouldn't be as big plus i'd have more money in my pocket for whatever. i know it would be a huge financial relief and my future self would appreciate it but it would also be a personal let down for me.

"advice for students moving to campus for the first time that i wish i was given when i was a freshman. hfs gives stupid advice and product recommendations. your ras are knowledgeable, but they're not the ones in control of the handbooks or websites. this is a collection of random tips i've accumulated in my time living at uw, and from friends of mine at uw and other colleges.  

&#x200b;

dorm supplies:

&#x200b;

***do not waste your money on ocm. i assume hfs gets a cut of sales, because the products are garbage.***

&#x200b;

for bedding, look on amazon, there are tons of twin xl (the size uw beds are) options there for far cheaper and with a better return policy than ocm (the company hfs shills for). buy a pillow online, at target, or bring one from home. i promise you they will be higher quality than ocm.

&#x200b;

for towels, go to target or, if you can, costco. the towels at costco are dirt cheap and very high quality. buy two bath towels and a dish towel. you can buy a bath mat, but i would just dry off in the shower and save the $8. 

&#x200b;

**for any kind of kitchenware, go to target.** i was able to buy one bowl, one plate, one dish, one fork, one knife, and one spoon for cheap. i recommend bringing some kind of thermos or travel mug to fill up on the free coffee in the dining halls in the morning to avoid buying the exact same coffee at starbucks for $5. 

&#x200b;

miscellaneous tips:

\-***don't buy the expensive dining plan.*** i was duped into thinking it was the best option before i set foot on campus (you've probably read the hfs guide saying that anything less than the level 4 will leave you without food half the time, that's complete bunk.) the food on campus is ok at best and very cheap. a meal costs around $8 at most, more with sides, so the $1100 or whatever the level 1 is plan will cover quite a lot. 

&#x200b;

\-additionally, you're in seattle. you're a 10 minute walk or a 20 minute bus ride from some of the best food in the world. don't waste all your college meals on a greasy sub-mcdonalds quality burger. 

&#x200b;

\-your dining account can be used at the district market (on-campus grocery store). i wouldn't use actual money here, as its almost all 10-40% more expensive than any other grocery store, but it's a good way to burn the money you won't want to use on junky fast food. 

&#x200b;

\-**amazon is your friend.** you will forget things. you will break things. you'll be living in seattle so 90% of packages will be able to be delivered next day, or if you're really lucky, later the same day. if you don't have prime but your parents do, have them set up amazon household, which will give you access to free prime shipping.

&#x200b;

\-**bring batteries and lightbulbs.** these are both weirdly expensive around the university, so buy them and bring them.

&#x200b;

\-**lighting is a must.** the dorms can get really dark and depressing, especially in overcast seattle winter, which is all of seattle winter. i wouldn't necessarily go so far as to spend $50 on a ""mood lamp"", but some fairy lights, desk lamps, floor lamps, or, if you're so inclined and your roommate doesn't object (ask first) tiktok style leds.

&#x200b;

\-on the same line as lighting, **bring a plant**. studies have repeatedly shown increased mood, energy, and focus in people who have leafy plants in their environments as compared to those who do not. pothos, lucky bamboo, and fiddleleaf fig are all pretty cheap and easy to care for. spend 10 minutes researching them so you don't kill them instantly and you'll be golden.

&#x200b;

\-laundry. doesn't have to be tide, but **any laundry pod is a lifesaver for dorm laundry.** you don't want to haul a 2 gallon jug of detergent up 5 flights of stairs (unless you're trying to get a leg workout in, in which case go for it). i have a collapsible hamper so i would often bring my laundry down with a pod or two, start it going,  put the hamper in my backpack, then go get lunch on the ave.

&#x200b;

\-**if you need a mini fridge, see if you can buy used.** i paid $50 on facebook marketplace for one that retails for $200. it's a little late now, but graduates often get rid of theirs at the end of the year. facebook marketplace is a great place to start looking. 

&#x200b;

\-**get a coffee maker / electric kettle.** either of these will pay for themselves in a month if you drink a lot of tea, coffee, or cocoa (also good for ramen).

&#x200b;

if you're not sure if you'll need something or not, err on the side of conservativism. dorms are small. you don't want to be like i was and have a bunch of storage bins full of junk i never used, or even wanted to use. save your money on the front end, don't buy a rice cooker and a, instant pot and an air fryer and a frying pan and 50 other things ""just in case"". if you realize you need something, buy it on amazon, or go to the store. if seattle seems expensive, hop on a bus (if i recall correctly the 522 or the 255 will work) and go to bellevue, kirkland, or redmond. on top of seeing more of the area if you're not from here, these towns can be much cheaper (also typically safer for walking alone but that's another issue for another post) than anywhere in seattle, and unlimited bus fare is included in tuition. 

&#x200b;

**off topic but maybe helpful bits of wisdom**

&#x200b;

**-**i always keep a few $1 bills in a pocket with nothing else in it when i'm walking around. this way, if one of the many many beggars around the ave or seattle in general comes up and asks, or worse, demands money, i can hand them a small amount without pulling out my whole wallet or risking dropping stuff. you will be asked for money. sometimes, you will be asked for money in a very forceful way. one wants to assume these are people down on their luck with the best intentions, but the reality is some are dangerous. **never pull out your wallet when giving an unhoused person or beggar money.** many are good people on bad times, some are not. 

&#x200b;

\-this applies to anyone, but especially those who are women or minorities of any kind, and those who are less physically intimidating. **avoid walking alone** off or near campus. the campus proper is fairly safe, but you go one street in any direction and all bets are off. do not walk alone, do not walk with headphones on, and do not walk at night. ensure bags are secure and closed. probably, you'll never have a problem. expect the best and plan for the worst. 

&#x200b;

\-**don't study in your dorm**. i could wax poetic about sleep hygiene all day but it boils down to this: don't use spaces for all purposes. sleep in your sleeping space, relax in your relaxation space, study in your study space. there are libraries for studying. they're very nice. use them. you will be more productive, i promise.

&#x200b;

\-**find your people.** don't rely on highschool friends alone for socialization in college. join a club you're genuinely passionate about, not that you think would look cool to be in. personally, i've made all my friends at uw through dungeons and dragons. anything that forces groups of 3-6 people together to interact on any personal level will absolutely build relationships. i might make a whole other post about this later. 

&#x200b;

i didn't set out with the intent to write this long of a post (in fact this was originally going to be a 1 paragraph psa about the dining level) but these are genuinely all things that if i had known going into college my first year i would have been much better off. hopefully this will help at least one person with at least one thing and if it does, it was worth it. if you have any other tips (the real lpt is always in the comments) i'll add them to the list with credit. feel free to repost or plagiarize any of this, if it would help more people know what they're doing.",advice

"homework use and chegg okay so this might be a dumb question, but i was wondering if it is considered academically dishonest or will result in penalty if i use chegg for homework. i often just avoid looking at the same questions assigned or even the problems altogether because i fear it's considered cheating and my ip might be reported. 

i honestly do not learn very well from most textbooks as they have few to no examples that are anything like the challenging problems and i can get stuck for hours to days on niche topics in math and sciences (with very few resources online and none directly relevant that can be found), feeling extremely stressed out and lost. i really only learn from seeing examples and then i can pick the concepts up in minutes that were overcomplicated in the text.

is it considered cheating/will you be reported for using chegg for homework? thank you.",academics

"phys 122 professor hi there,

i was looking at courses and was wanting to take phys 122 as an incoming engrud student. because of my efig, my only option for phys 122 for autumn quarter would be section b with aurel bulgac. his rate my prof page seems to be very poor while the other section is taught by arka majumdar, who has better approval. my question is, is it worth waiting for winter quarter to take phys 122 with another prof, instead of this autumn with aurel bulgac.  


additionally, something to note is i am wanting to apply for early placement for an engineering major for the april deadline, so that is something that is concerning me - does having phys 122 and 123 for submission with potentially lower grade than if i am to take phys 122 winter quarter, drastically change my odds of getting my intended major of mechanical engineering?

"advice to deal with exam regrets hello everyone,

i need some serious advice right now. so about a week and a half ago, i had a physics 116 exam that didn't go as well as i expected. i was super bummed because the exam seemed easy enough when i was doing it but my score said otherwise. the answer key was released over the weekend and i made the unfortunate decision to take a look at what i got wrong. i don't know why i did this to myself but now i can't stop thinking about it.

for those who don't know how the physics exams work - we have 20 questions, each 5 points so essentially each question is worth 5%. after looking at my exam, i realized that i somehow made 3 of the stupidest mistakes ever which caused me to lose 15 points and hence 15% (i got 75% but could've gotten 90%). i don't even know how i missed those because i got them correct when i redid them and i have been feeling really guilty.

now, every time i try to study physics, that keeps popping up in my brain and i feel like its eating m alive - honestly.

i just feel so guilty and am so scared about the next exam and what might happen there. because of my bad score here, i need to ace my next exam so that i can still get the grade that i want/need in that class.

any advice on how to get past this would be appreciated.

"advice about workload? sorry if these kinds of posts are getting repetitive, but i was wondering if anyone had advice on whether or not i'm setting myself up to go crazy fall quarter. i contacted my advisor about my schedule, but because my official community college transcript hasn't been processed yet, all that are on my uw transcript are generic classes (like dept xxx) that make it seem like i haven't finished weedouts like physics, chem, and calculus yet, even though i have. my high school counselor didn't include my running start class codes on my high school transcript, so that's why there's the confusion. 

right now, i'm in engrud and finished all of the requirements to place into 6 engineering majors (hopefully aero/astro) except for engr 101. a lot of the next classes i would be taking for aerospace engineering were already full when i registered, so i did what i could to find classes that would still be interesting:

engr 101 & gen st 199, math 224 (nw), m e 123 (vlpa), ess 102 (i&s), astr 301 (nw).

i feel like i could probably do well even with 17 credits, but i'm worried that i might miss out on opportunities outside of class. looking on uwgrades, i think this would probably come out to around 32 hours per week. in any case, if any of you have been in a similar situation or dealt with a similar schedule, i would really appreciate any advice, and thanks in advance!",advice
"is my freshman schedule too hard? hello uw community! i am an incoming freshman majoring in biochem and wanted to ask if my fall quarter schedule is too hard. i currently signed up to take chem 145 (honors gen chem), math 125*, and biol 180 (intro bio). 

i am also a pre-med and i was thinking of maybe dropping chem 145 and switch to chem 142 (gen chem). i know gpa matters a lot for med school applications and i am more than willing to make the adjustment. i heard that chem 145 is hard but worthwhile because of how much you learn. my only worry is maintaining a high gpa because i know i’ll be taking it with top students. 

also, i had so many credits transfer in that i am now a sophomore standing. i would take an easier gen elective but there’s not much i can take. i would rather try to get my degree requirements finished if anything. 

any advice would be super helpful! thank you ahead of time!

"my advice for incoming freshmen attending uw (part 1) going to college is not an easy thing because you'll face numerous invisible challenges starting your first quarter or semester. and your first year is the foundation for the entire undergraduate career, so some silly mistakes will cost you. as a rising sophomore this fall at the university of washington, here are my genuine advice on how to effectively and joyfully spend your first year. i hope it's helpful!

​

# 1. start connecting your classmates before the year begins

you'll very likely to find the group chat on the internet after you accepted the enrollment, or even before the admission cycle closed. social media platforms like discord, facebook, or loopchat usually have a big group chat that includes every member of the incoming class (if they get admitted), and some of the people in the group chat may still waitlisted. getting to know each other from here is a great opportunity, you will know people with various majors. later in the spring, you'll start to apply for the housing, and the best way is to reach out people, as many as possible. having your first group of college friends makes you advantaged than those who do not. simply, don't wait until the fall and panic.

​

# 2. do not pack your entire home to the dorm

as an international student from china, i was worried that i cannot get specific items abroad when packing for my first year of studying in 2016, so i literally squeezed as many things as possible into two 28-inch suitcases. unfortunately, my assumption was wrong. i can purchase all my stationaries, cookware, bedding supplies, and any general items at walmart, target, and many grocery stores. i understand you concern about cannot getting something you desire, but the university of washington itself is urban-setting, which you can get things you need within walkable distance. lastly, things like power outlet, bedding supplies, and clothes are made differently in the u.s., and i do not want you to unwillingly throw your stuff away if it doesn't fit.

​

# 3. the best way to beat homesickness is stay active

if you're an international or out-of-state student, you will probably hit a wall at sometime during the fall or early winter due to a combination of factors, which could be homesickness. this could happen anytime during the year when you feel unable to handle the cultural differences, language barriers, academic pressure, and loneliness. at this point, don't freak out. negative emotions and attitudes can adversely affect your mental health and academic success. now it's the time to talk to people around you, attend collegiate athletic events, join the student organizations, and do not stay inside your dorm 15 hours a day! social life and self-adjustment are the only ways can help you. once you get engaged, you will realize time pasts really fast.

​

# 4. take the entire core sequence courses if possible

lots of public flagship universities may have introductory sequence courses, especially for stem subjects, and those classes can be extremely challenging compared to some upper-division classes. the math 124-5-6 (introductory calculus sequence, also called math 12x) at uw is known for its rigor and students with ap calculus scores can directly jump into math 125 or math 126. but i strongly recommend you restart the sequence even you have ap calculus credits. math 12x courses are taught twice as fast as typical high school ap classes with higher expectations, if you don't get used to the college teaching style, you will not doing great even you already know the entire curriculum of math 12x. you need study skills to survive.

​

# 5. tenured professors are not always have fantastic teaching skills

sadly, you're less likely to have a ""teacher"" at uw or any large public universities, especially in stem classes. universities like uw and uc always hire professors to do specific researches for their departments, and the departments rarely offer specialized training on teaching. this results some professors are expertise in their fields but have zero experiences on teaching. they can teach classes, but not as good as your high school calculus teacher. they are paid for the research, not all the classes taught during the academic year. you cannot flip the professor's teaching style, so i suggest you either switch to another section, work hard with your classmates, or wait till next academic term. complaining doesn't solve anything.

​

# 6. make friends with common interests and hobbies only

college campus is huge enough to have people from different cultural backgrounds, so it's obvious that we will meet lots of ""weird"" people around. i know some incoming freshmen tend to blend in no matter what, to get them socially engaged. socializing is really fun, but sometimes it can be devastating if we used inappropriate manners. if you made a bunch of friends and found yourself unpleasant, steer clear. found something that fits your interest, go for it. in college campuses, the quality of your friends could influence your future development. a high-quality friend circle will help you building solid network beyond college, even for the entire life. ",student life

many public universities such as the university of washington (seattle), university of minnesota (twin cities), and new york university, have its campus in urban settings, which means the campus is no difference from a city neighborhood. there's no fences around (columbia university in nyc is an exception), so you're responsible for protecting yourself. regardless when you're walking on the ave (university way), put away your cellphone and headphone and refrain yourself from carrying large amounts of cash (anything exceeds $200). also, for those who have chemistry or physics lab sections ending past 8:30pm or want late-night social life, i recommend not to wear some luxurious or attractive outfits. don't make yourself being a target, it's not good.

# 8. buy a cheap bike with an expensive lock (even multiple)

getting your bike stolen creates unnecessary burden to your life, but bike thefts are preventable. i reviewed all the incidents reported to uwpd from september 2020 to july 2021, most of the bike thefts were happened in west campus dorm and its surrounding, parking lots, life science building, light rail station, and the medicine building. those places are either have beautiful scene or always crowded. the best way is to buy a cheap bike (from walmart, or less than $500) with a few expensive locks (one u-lock and one combination lock). and never set password as something like 1-1-1-1 or 1-2-3-4, those passwords not help. lastly, put your bike with others, or take a picture if possible. once you noticed something suspicious, report to uwpd immediately. one of my friends in minneapolis suffered from bike lost this summer multiple times, so i want give a warning on those who want to get expensive ones.

​

# 9. some good professors may not be help for your grades

the stem weedouts at uw have horror stories, and most of it comes from phys 12x and math 12x sequences. and lots of my friends were seeking professor andrew loveless' class (math 126 this past year) after seeing some comments on ratemyprofessor. however, if you're not smart as those applying for cs or acms, rusty test-taking strategies, or want stellar grades, then a good professor may not help you. first, good professors making the concepts digestible so most of the class can easily understand. second, grades are curved, so if you made some silly mistakes (like 1+1=3), your grade will be lower than you expected. lastly, great professor usually has brutal curve, especially in math 12x. terrible professors have hard exam but more rooms for making mistakes. my math 124 professor yu yuan was terrible at lecturing but i ended up with a decent grade.

​

# 10. never staying up late when you have exam in the upcoming day

before the midterm or the final exam, we're all stressed because we want to do well. however, if you desire the best performance on the exam, then please do not be the ""all nighter"" beforehand, even your exam is not in the morning (before 10:30am). cramming exams will only increase your anxiety rather than calming down. when i know my midterm is coming, i start learning and reviewing about 5–10 days ahead and on the day before the exam, i sleep at latest 12am. you don't like the drowsy feeling when taking the exam, do you? college is already stressful enough, adding extra stress will adversely affect your exam performance and mental health. in general, regardless of when your exam starts, never stay up late and begging for retake afterward.",advice

"potential vaccine difficulties hello uw people,

i wanted to mention that the policies of the uw and/or wa may require students to have either: 1) proof of full vaccination or 2) proof of a negative covid19 result within the last seven days (using pcr). these policies may be in lieu of a mandate, and instead may increase vaccination adoption due to the inconvenience of getting a pcr test each week. the biden administration is requiring businesses with federal contracts and federal workers to have either proof of vaccination or negative covid19 test via the [july 29th order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-new-actions-to-get-more-americans-vaccinated-and-slow-the-spread-of-the-delta-variant/).

other countries have similar policies, but they are generally for the entry into their borders, and not necessarily for each entry into a building. czechia [has a similar order to the biden administration](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/file/protective-measure-of-the-ministry-of-healthcare-against-sars-cov-2.aspx), in which residents and foreigners may be asked to present either a negative covid19 pcr test within the last seven days, or proof of vaccination. the link above will take you to the czechia pdf, and i believe the applicable order is i. 4c. 

this is a presumption based on the recent policies from the biden administration and the policies of other nations.",advice

"an open letter the university of washington the university of washington has condemned me and other disabled students with immune deficiency, as well as their families. every 12 hours i take two medications to prevent my body from recognizing foreign solid organs that i received as part of a transplant. because of this, i am more susceptible to covid-19 and other infectious diseases, something i have known for a long time. what many don’t know is that an additional consequence of these medications is reduced vaccine efficacy. i have received two doses, a booster, and have had covid-19, and i still lack the antibodies to fight the disease.

the university of washington, like many other universities across the country, has opted for in-person learning this fall. most students and faculty are eager for the opportunity to be back on campus. however, the harsh reality for some is that the options provided by the university are subpar, dangerous, and are directly against access to learning for all students. i know i am not the only student with an immune deficiency, and i know that there are students with family members who are immune deficient.

the options before myself, as presented by the drs, are as follows: hope that professors are willing to alter their course structures significantly to accommodate a single student, take less courses, request accommodations through the drs which they have stated will be extremely limited and hard to acquire, or take the quarter off. most of these place undue stress on students and instructors, both emotionally as well as financially.

with little over a month until the beginning of fall quarter, myself and my living partner have had no access to resources to protect ourselves from covid-19 on campus. i have options, as listed above, however, my partner  — who sleeps next to me — has been told that there are no options for them, because they have no disability, making what little accommodations provided to myself useless so long as my partner must return to in-person learning.

i thank all the professors and advisors who’ve been corresponding with my partner and i this summer, trying to help in any way possible, and informing us that the university refuses to provide professors with guidance and resources for specific cases. this is the direct responsibility of the university, to provide guidance for student and faculty guidance, and reassurances that they will support all types of learning to guarantee that students can become educated in the safest and most effective way possible.

so while summer winds its way to a close and we continue to sit at home keeping our minds and bodies as active in any safe manner possible, the fall looms with unanswered questions, anxiety about more than assignments, and a sadness that the university i was once so proud to be a part of has become such a risk.

"will i regret living in shoreline? as someone who is from out of state in a less urban environment, i recently made the decision to spent my first grad year at uw in shoreline. i made this decision because:

* the more suburban environment may be easier to acclimate to as i transition to seattle.

* the prices are cheaper and apartments are better for the price.

* i have the options of car and bike commute, plus using the upcoming northgate tc as a middle man. 

* worst case scenario, if everything goes back to being virtual, a more removed area sounds like a better situation.

"advice to my younger freshman self... ...from future you, who's been on campus for less than 2 quarters

1. please read up what panic attacks and anxiety looks like. cause when you took only half an edible and freaked out, you could've saved money by not going to the hospital. general rule of thumb, don't do anything new drug wise by yourself 

2. i don't care how cute it was when your first date with that junior was watching atla, trust him when he says he doesn't want a relationship. you're only hurting by staying and he is definitely not changing for you lol

3. make multiple friend groups. not just that group of people on your floor who gush about superbad. because trust me if (actually when) that group falls apart you're going to feel like the whole world is ending. make friends everywhere and you're going to be just fine

4. that best friend 3,000 miles away from you? not worth staying in your room convincing her to video call when friends at your door are holding snacks and ice cream because they wanted to support you during that friend breakup. sometimes you outgrow people from your past and that's ok. it just means you're getting closer to being the person you're meant to be 

5. don't walk alone at night on the ave and greek row. if that boy cared about you, he would've cared about your safety

6. flick the bean in the morning. don't care how horny you are because 2 seconds away from finishing you're going to accidently make eye contact with your roommate who also thought you were sleeping...

7. 4am at ode with friends and strangers is going to make you happier than that one frat party 

8. stop taking school so serious and get out of your room. trust yourself that the after class revision was enough 

9. water and center table's scrambled eggs the next morning. your keys are in the fridge btw

10. ice in that drink! don't grind on the guy dressed up as harry potter! go with three friends if you anticipate going home with some other girl!

10. actually no take your studies seriously. after that first midterm, midterm season doesn't stop until 2 weeks before the end of quarter. get back on that smh

11. just know no matter what you did your best. you aren't perfect and no one is. even that girl who seems to have everything (4.0 in cse, a bf, perfect outfits, perfect body, etc.) focus on doing your best.

12. stop taking everything so goddamn personal. you aren't the moon kissing the night sky. you have to sing under the sea with all your heart. you have to shovel cheerios 2 mins before your 8:30 because you know you aren't going to function later. you have to pause for a minute and just admire those corgis. you have to stop spending hours after a test figuring out your grade and then your back up major. you've got to stop trying to make your neighbors like you. fuck it kid. you've got to love yourself.

13. i'm proud of you even if mom doesn't tell you. your value doesnt go down when she yells at you for not carrying your tracker (sorry i mean cellular device) everywhere. you aren't a whore

14. that guy from madrona? that girl from calc? those people you randomly met? i can't wait for you to get to know them because you're going to find so much love. open your heart to then and watch how you heal in a healthy environment. you deserve this

"how to get a credible esa letter (that works for uw on-campus housing and maybe off-campus housing)? hi, i have mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and i'd really like to get a pet during college to relax and ground me, especially because i'll be moving on-campus and having college classes in person for the first time. last year was my first year in college and i did distance learning living at home with my dysfunctional family :') and a week or two ago i went to the mall with my friends and got really burnt out for approximately two days just because i had too many ""hello, welcome to the store, are you looking for anything today?"" ""no, we're just browsing, thank you so much!"" interactions 💀, so the prospect of moving on-campus and having classes in person is very stressful for me. 

i messaged my doctor about having an emotional support animal as an option to support my mental health (they were the one who diagnosed me and also prescribed me medication, which has improved my baseline level of stress and speed of recovery from things like spirals, but i am still mentally ill, i'm sure), but i was told it was their organization's policy to not provide esa letters and they referred me to another organization to connect me to a therapist who would meet my needs. however, that organization told me that ""most providers will not see a patient just for a letter but are willing to write one after a few sessions if the patient plans on continuing seeing them for long term therapy"" and i'm not really certain that long term therapy is for me in terms of my finances and my specific relationship with my mental health. 

when i told them about my situation and ambivalence about long term therapy, they said that they could help me find a long term therapy provider, or if i only want an esa letter, to get one through esa doggy. however, some quick google searches say that esa doggy is maybe not legit and other esa letter websites say that they're legit, but other's aren't (and they throw shade at each other, though they also all claim to connect people to a local licensed professional who is qualified to write an esa letter), and some places say that no esa letters provided through online means are legit so 🤡.

i'd really appreciate if a current or recent uw student could tell me about how the process works and how i can obtain a legit esa letter. i'm also going to be rooming with some friends this year on campus and one of them is on the fence about having a pet in their space because we have to share a room (which is fair and i respect that) so we wanted to wait until the end of autumn quarter and get an esa during the winter break, and i wanted to get the approval process done ahead of time because i thought it might take a while, so i have some time to find figure out what's best for me and to deliberate. the esa will also likely be a crested gecko because my one of my roommates is allergic to furry pets and after a lot of research, i currently feel like it would be the best pet i could care for that also fits my needs.

"going back on campus (rant + advice for incoming students) i have been abroad working in a few countries in northern africa the last few months and i am so excited to come back for fall quarter. i am genuinely giddy. my god i miss everyone so much. not just my friends that i haven’t seen the last few months but the pre-covid university atmosphere and every little great and shitty thing that comes with it. 

like many people here, i am definitely a little nervous going back in person. but my sheer joy currently is overruling every other emotion i am currently experiencing. 

for those of you who are anxious though and have not been on campus previously, here is an (unsolicited) message for you: you are not alone and don’t let the overwhelming, big school atmosphere paralyze you. 

while i don’t believe in fate, i believe that because uw is so big and provides so many opportunities that there truly is a community for everyone, you just have to take the time to find it. 

if this is your first quarter on campus, slow down, remember to breathe, and remember that everyone takes different periods of time to adjust to new environments. 

also, if any new foster students have any questions about getting adjusted or just want to talk, dm me. i am also always free for a coffee chat in paccar :) 

much love and hope to see everyone on campus",student life

"everything we learned at efs some of the freshmen i've met online have a lot of questions about moving on campus, so my friend and my roommate and i got together and created a master list of everything that we learned at efs. 

**what to pack:** 

1. bring more masks than you think you’ll need.
   1. bring all the masks. you will wear them all the time. bring disposable ones for emergencies, and reusable ones so you don't go broke buying disposable ones. right now, uw requires students to wear masks in lounges, laundry rooms, basically anywhere that's not your dorm or outside. you will need masks. 
2. a fan. 
   1. it will probably cool off soon, but climate change is kicking my southern butt right now. there is no air conditioning, so it can get hot and sweaty in the dorms. if you have room, bring one. 
3. hand sanitizer. 
   1. especially the mini-bottles that you can carry with you. 
4. card games, if you have them.
   1. they’re a great way to make friends. the best ones are cards against humanity, catan, and uno. so far, i've made, like, five friends with cah. 
5. headphones. 
   1. invest in nice, noise-canceling ones if you can; it will be helpful if the dorms are a little loud. they’re also essential for zoom calls in rooms you share with other people. 
6. deodorant. 
   1. this is a no-brainer, but please bring deodorant. because the dorms get hot, people get sweaty, and when people get sweaty, people get smelly. my roommate gets very sweaty, and their use of deodorant is very much appreciated. 
7. a cart/bin/drawers to use as a pantry/medicine cabinet.
   1. check with your roommate(s) if you want to share one. my roommate and i share a chart that has our snacks and meds on it and it is very useful. 
8. a very basic toolkit; you’ll never know when you’ll need a screwdriver. 
9. toilet paper (if you have a private bathroom)
   1. the bathrooms don’t come with toilet paper and you’re going to need a lot more than you realize. 
10. cleaning supplies 
   1. you'll also like having a clean dorm, so bring clorox wipes, or cleaning spray, or magic erasers, or whatever you use.  you also may need wipes to clean up the kitchen when someone inevitably leaves half their lunch all over the counter. 
11. extra phone/computer/ipad charger.
   1. currently, my friend gage has a dead phone and is sitting in my room charging said phone because he locked himself out of his dorm and forgot his charger. don't be like gage. also, get a portable charger if you can. good for long classes and long days out. 
12. a surge protector extension cord (maybe even two?)
   1. there are like, two power outlets per person in each dorm and you will be plugging a lot of stuff in. 
13. slides/slippers.
   1. shoes that are easy to pull on. they’re good for going to do laundry, running out real quick, etc. 
14. britta water filter pitcher 
   1. the tap water here sucks booty. water filter pitchers are great because you can put them in the fridge and have cold water for your water bottle. if you don't bring one, you can get one at target. this is also a good thing to buy with your roommate, as you'll *both* be using it often. 
15. reusable bags. essential for grocery shopping, farmer’s market runs, thrifting, etc. 
16. shower caddy.
   1. if you have your own bathroom, get one that you can stick to the wall or hang on the showerhead. there’s not much space to put your soap in the shower, so a caddy is essential. 

**what to buy here (or bring beforehand, i'm not stopping you)** 

1. mini-fridge
   1. some people recommend renting a mini-fridge, and that is helpful because you don’t have to worry about installing it. the only downside is that one person on our floor still hasn’t gotten his mini-fridge yet and it's been three weeks. not sure what's going on there. if you do decide to buy a mini-fridge, make sure to check in with your roommate to make sure they didn’t get a mini-fridge yet. 
2. microwave
   1. see mini-fridge. on a side note, if you’re cheap and want to save money, check to see if your floor lounge has a microwave. some do, some don’t, and sometimes the ones that do are used a lot. a good thing to consider. 
3. cooking supplies. 
   1. you won’t cook too often, but it is nice making your own food or cooking with friends once in a while. for those occasions, one pot and one pan are enough. again, it may be a good idea to buy and share cooking supplies with your roommate. 
4. extra hangers. 
   1. if you like hanging your clothes up, you may need extra for when you buy school t-shirts or go thrifting. 
5. paper towels
   1. you will use them all the time. you’ll clean with them, use them as plates, use them as emergency toilet paper, etc. very, very useful. 
6. air freshener if you have a smelly roommate (or if you’re the smelly roommate).

**general tips**

1. you won’t use as much husky card money as you think, but also note district market is hella overpriced. 
2. please. for the love of jesus christ superstar clean up after using the kitchen. don’t be the asshole who puts his leftover rice in the goddamn sink and not in the garbage disposal or trash and leaves sauce stains all over the stove. 
   1. i’m not salty at all. 
3. don’t feel obligated to talk to people on your floor who make you uncomfortable. you don’t have to talk to them; hang out with people you actually like. 
   1. furthermore, never be afraid to leave a social event where you don’t feel comfortable. 
4. get used to walking and walking a lot. 
   1. also, figure out how long it takes to get to places you’ll go often, especially target or starbucks. seattle is very hilly, so half a mile can feel more like two miles. 
5. eating out is fun, but make sure to keep an eye on how much you’re spending. you will probably accidentally spend more than you realize. 
6. there is a difference between your husky card balance and your dining card balance. 
   1. your husky card balance is for laundry and the bookstore. it is easy to load up with the money. your dining card balance is for any food on campus and district market. they are two different accounts but you use the same card. 
7. light-rail is very fun. going to phoenix comic bookstore in capitol hill is also very fun. they have magic the gathering commander nights on wednesdays but get there early because spots fill up quickly. 
8. figure out where your classes are before your classes.  
9. have a diverse diet. eat the occasional fruit/vegetable you heathen. that way you don’t feel like shit all the time. 
10. steal your parents’ netflix password before you leave for school. it’s awkward to ask for it after you get to school. 
11. the varsity theatre has very cheap tickets for popular movies, but the movie theatre is very dark and the picture is usually very dim and hard to see (especially if it’s a darker movie like a dc flick), plus the speakers are painfully loud. 
12. don’t isolate yourself first weeks. no one has friends the first week. go and talk to people you friggin bean. everyone is looking to make friends the first week so don’t be shy. 

there's also a lovely google doc master post that was super helpful for my packing experience: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/19i1ucnsehjyqmesolgorspw7boudkube-tuude6kmvg/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19i1ucnsehjyqmesolgorspw7boudkube-tuude6kmvg/mobilebasic)

"kinda regret the choices i make 
i’m an international transfer student who is supposed to come to campus this fall but there is a covid outbreak in my city so the chance of me traveling to the united states is very low. the government closed the highways, train station to general public so it’s extremely difficult for me to leave the city, but it’s still possible. and the government is not likely to lift the lockdown before september 29 which is the time the classes start.

also, i won’t be able to travel after sep 29 because the cbp will most likely deny my entry.

i emailed the admissions several times and they got back to me with the same response: 
“in general, uw does not grant deferrals. if we do not offer any remote course options and you are unable to travel to the u.s. by september 29, you may request a deferral.”

with the shitty things happening, i don’t feel like attending the uw that much though it was my dream school.

here are my options:

1. register for one online class and retain my admission spot and see if i can travel to the united states in winter. but then i’ll have to pay thousands of dollars in tuition for a class i don’t even need, and 3 months of expensive housing because of the lease contract. or defer the fall admission which is very unlikely according to the admissions.

2. withdrawal from the university and reapply for another university i favored in canada. by doing this i’m essentially taking a gap year, and i might do some interns during this time. 

i’m considering the second option because my plan was to study in canada when i graduate from uw, so i might as well go there two years ahead and i get to study in the major i like instead of the back up major at uw. but that would definitely extend my time as an undergrad.

i kinda regret the choices i made this year and i really don’t know what to do. things suck",advice

"stay safe on the ave guys! so, yesterday, after a night of fun and excitement, i decided to refill my stomach with some late night tacos at memos and headed over there. while i was waiting in line, one guy was pushed into the shop by a shirtless guy violently. the shirtless guy started pummeling the other one with punches around and around the floor for what seemed like a good five minutes before he was called out by his companions and left. during the fight, plastic signboards were thrown, chairs shoved and the customers of the restaurant were invisible to the attackers eyes.

but that wasn't the end of my crazy night. immediately after the scene and the actors cleared up, another guy entered the shop through the open window, moved a chair around to the garbage disposal at the center of the restaurant, dug though the trash and started drinking something he found in there. he ambled around for a few minutes, picked up and pocketed what seemed like a knife to me and tried to sneak away with takeout boxes. he was stopped by one of the restaurant workers on his way out and gave up though.

i had to wait a good five to ten minutes for my order to be complete and then left for home. on my way out who do i see? the same actors still roaming about on the ave. with a lot of new students coming in, this is just a reminder to stay safe, avoid sketchy areas, not venture out too late alone or to move in groups at such times. be boundless guys!!",student life

"advice/guide to new uw students this is dedicated to people that want to maximize their college experience and either come from nothing and/or really just wanna run it up 💰make the most of all the tuition you’re paying already lol might as well 🤷🏽‍♂️

i’m a senior my final quarter in uw cse. i’m mexican and my family efc is $0 so i come from the bottom of the bottom. this has been the biggest advantage for me going into uw cse, as i’ve found more doors opened for me than i could have ever dreamed of. i’m a grinder, so i spent so much time maximizing the resources here.

you're gonna meet the smartest people you've ever met in your life, and once you graduate you're gonna have connections to every big company all over the world. here’s some of the things i’ve learned over my years here:

\*note this is especially helpful for cs/info majors but doesn’t mean you can’t look into it too :)

&#x200b;

1. **social + study**: use the pomodoro study technique or find something that works. talk to as many people in your classes as you can, f\*\*\* being shy it'll pay off pretty hard early on you'll see. make study groups whenever you can, a lot of people don't talk to each other especially in the beginning so just ask anyone to study w u and they'll almost always say yes. you can reserve some of the really nice study spaces around campus here (not all are open cuz covid): [lib.washington.edu/services/spaces/study](http://lib.washington.edu/services/spaces/study). use the academic support programs! its free homework and class help from people that know their stuff that can get you through basically every intro class and well into your major: [academicsupport.washington.edu](http://academicsupport.washington.edu/).
2. **more social:** there’s even a bowling alley, e-sports room, and arcade to hang out at: [hub.washington.edu/play](http://hub.washington.edu/play). canoes and kayaks at the waterfront: [washington.edu/ima/waterfront/boat-rentals](http://washington.edu/ima/waterfront/boat-rentals). explore the ave w someone, find your fav food places.
3. **fitness:** go to the gym please. don’t even have to go crazy hard, you’re already paying for it in tuition so go on the treadmill for 30min after class every day. you’ll be feeling amazing in no time. there’s intermural sports leagues for anyone that wants to play a sport regularly but isn’t pro. there’s rock climbing, swimming, martial arts, yoga, archery, even a golf range, you name it they most likely got it: [washington.edu/ima](http://washington.edu/ima).
4. **clubs**: there’s an insane amount of clubs so just spend a day going through this directory and find something that interests you: [huskylink.washington.edu](http://huskylink.washington.edu/). you can make electric cars, bikes, your own canoe, and a bunch of other clubs that look insanely good on a resume + there's some just plain fun ones (find people in your niche like movie club).
5. **health:** use hall health’s resources. schedule times during your quarter to talk to a psychologist, getting your mental on point is key to everything. you also get one free checkup per quarter. also they got free condoms (stay safe y’all)!!
6. **food:** there’s a really nice free(!!!) food pantry that every uw student get access to once a week: [washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry](http://washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry). you can also sign up for snap benefits (free money to spend on food every month) if you’re at least part time: [washington.edu/financialaid/types-of-aid/food-stamps](http://washington.edu/financialaid/types-of-aid/food-stamps).
7. **electronics:** you don’t have to buy almost any electronic. you can rent really nice cameras (started me off on my pro photography journey), laptops, lighting equipment for potential yt channels or tiktoks, calculators, tablets (including the new ipad pro), speakers, projectors, mics, and even vr headsets: [stlp.uw.edu](https://stlp.uw.edu). allowed me to save up enough money until i could get my own (theres also student discounts at the microsoft and apple store among others). i’m a computer expert so lmk if you need help buying something.
8. **maker space + studio:** uw maker space ([hfs.uw.edu/the-mill/maker-space](http://hfs.uw.edu/the-mill/maker-space)) offers 3d printers, vinyl cutters, computers w free adobe software, sewing and embroidery machines, and even circuit board stations among others. between this and #7 you can literally start your own online company. there’s also a **music** **studio** w all the equipment you’d ever need to record songs or just mess around in. pretty crazy.
9. **credit card:** drop whatever you're doing and get a credit card (start once you’re 18), get this one its for people that don't have credit yet: [**discover.com/credit-cards/secured/**](http://discover.com/credit-cards/secured/)
10. **coding\*:** literally spend your free time on [**leetcode.com**](http://leetcode.com/) just practicing coding questions, the earlier you get an internship the easier it'll be to get future ones. look through harvard cs50's course to get a good start on fundamentals. sign up for dubhacks even if you don’t know s\*\*\*, i met a bunch of really cool juniors and seniors that guided me my first year even though i didn’t have experience: [dubhacks.co](http://dubhacks.co/). also cs kids use the labs pls they have 4k monitors, nice ass chairs, remote desktop, snack bar (not free but cheaper than the rest of campus) and free printing (unfortunately it costs money on the rest of campus).
11. **research:** find a field you're interested and find the contact info of faculty members and ask for research positions in their labs or w grad students they know. the earlier you do this the better but you might struggle to find a position early on, just keep trying.
12. **student jobs:** you can do work study and you'll get extra money every quarter (you can work up to the amount that's included in your award letter under the work study section), an example is working in local pointe. there's also jobs that are on campus but aren't work study, they're limited to uw students and its separate from work study so you don't need to have that offer in your aid letter to apply, an example is the allen school ambassador position.
13. **college tax credits**: american opportunity tax credit, can get extra money from the gov for two separate years during college (as long as you're full time), worth filing your taxes even if you don't have a job for this reason.
14. **internships\*:** find a list of freshman internships/opportunities on reddit and apply to all of them, they're specially designed for people just starting college so you have a higher chance of getting in + you'll meet dope ass people. check out microsoft new tech especially i did that and it was a great experience.
15. **financial aid:** you can get enough financial aid/scholarships/grants that uw pays you every quarter for your expenses, i started off with receiving $2k every quarter and got all the way to $6k/quarter. there’s a cap on this (i think 8k for in-state but i could be wrong), so apply to every scholarship that you can. apply to emergency aid when you’re in financial need: [washington.edu/emergencyaid](http://washington.edu/emergencyaid) (will open when quarter starts, can usually apply a couple times a quarter).
16. **finances + investing:** once you start making money start making your money work for you, forget about spending it. move all your money to an fdic-insured high interest savings account (bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/). or spend it on niches/things that will retain value. i wasted a lot of it on video games and other things that didn’t hold their value. if you play your cards right you could easily have 50k+ before you even graduate (i didn’t have loans). more financial advice at the bottom of the post if you’re interested. if you're interested in **options trading** check this video out: [**youtube.com/watch?v=sd7sw0bf1ms&t=1588s**](http://youtube.com/watch?v=sd7sw0bf1ms&t=1588s)
17. **license + car:** get a license even if you're not planning to get a car, it'll drop your insurance rates by hundreds when you got that 🔥 internship money to get one. use zipcar to get around seattle, theres a discount for students so you don’t even need to get your own car.
18. **uw student discounts:** here’s a website that lists all the discounts uw students receive: [thewholeu.uw.edu/tag/discounts/](http://thewholeu.uw.edu/tag/discounts/). you can go to the zoo for cheap and visit some of the museums around seattle on a discount.
19. **textbooks:** you don’t necessarily have to pay for textbooks (especially in your later classes), you can find plenty of links online just search reddit. some classes unfortunately tie their participation grade to online versions of the textbook so just take the l on those.
20. **scholarships:** you can get scholarships for study abroad so you can basically go for free, checkout the gilman scholarship, also the allen school has a lot of scholarships (some departments offer scholarships for in-major students, usually starts your second year as the application period is during the summer).
21. **and most importantly, for everyone but especially the bros**: up your fashion/general glow game i see too many damn people rocking sweats and tech t-shirts for all 4/5 years they’re at uw. go to h&m or pacsun or literally any decent place at the mall, get a beard by using minoxidil (i went from baby face to full facial hair) or learn to trim it pls get a philips norelco ($50), use teeth whitening strips, go to the dentist, (**girls** wash your hair yes we can see the oil + fix your **anterior pelvic tilt** (google)), look up videos on fixing your posture, use chapstick, pls use deodorant, find fashion yters, cut your damn nails, get basic skin treatment products, go to the barber at least every other month, get your eyebrows done, get a tongue brush, use floss, get separate body wash and shampoo (i’m looking at you irish spring 5000 in 1), get a korean body scrubber or loofah (you’re welcome, no your hands are not enough it helps w body acne), get a nice perfume/cologne at sephora, use moisturizer. i found all this info cuz i was sick of lookin like a scrub, looks aren’t everything ofc but these are the basics and they’ll help get your confidence up.

bonus: apply to this [**foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/undergraduate-entrepreneurship/lavin-entrepreneurship-program**](http://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/undergraduate-entrepreneurship/lavin-entrepreneurship-program), which is now open and closes october 24th, its a program that lets you meet ceos around the seattle area and meet a bunch of amazing people, also consider doing the entrepreneurship minor they give you money to make your own company.

this isn’t a definitive guide but it should help you navigate uw and set you up for success. also don't drink too much alcohol it makes you sluggish and will decrease your physical wellbeing (i notice even one glass in the gym the next day) but remember to have fun every once in a while (finding a balance is key tbh you're prob gon struggle for your first few years w this).

as recently as last quarter i was an allen school ambassador so i’d be down to schedule some relaxed office hours to answer any questions y’all have. thanks and good luck y’all! dm me here or on ig if you have more questions: [instagram.com/geov.cas](http://instagram.com/geov.cas).

edit: more bonus stuff, if you gotta gaming pc use it to mine ethereum, or better yet look into crypto lending exchanges, you basically lend whatever crypto you own and earn interest off it. look into registering an llc and you can start your business credit score if you're ever thinking of opening up one in the future.

edit 2: for those interested, here’s the approach i took to financials. what i’d recommend is: 

1. i transferred all of my money from becu (0.5% interest rate up to $500) to varo bank (this gave me a rate of 1.5% up to 10k, which was considered high during the pandemic, there’s probably better ones out there now) 
2. learn about stocks and options in general ofc but especially learn the greeks (youtu.be/sd7sw0bf1ms) 
3. learn technical analysis (youtu.be/eynxyokgpng)
4. develop a trading strategy (mainly for long term stocks)
5. get some graphing software (i recommend trading view)
6. stocks: place 80% of your whatever amount you’re comfortable investing into long term stocks
7. options: once you’ve learned your stuff place 20% in options. i chose to implement a 20% gain target and a -20% stop loss (tune to your risk level)
8. remember time in the market beats timing the market after all. at the end of the day i know jack shit compared to big investors but this is what i’ve been able to learn during the pandemic, educate yourself and hopefully the concept at least piques your interest!",advice

"[u-pass] remember to tap on and tap off on light rail for some students who use the light rail in wa for the first time, please remember to tap on before you board the train, and tap off after you leave the train.

if you fail to tap on before you board the train, when a fare enforcement officer comes around to check that you paid your fare,  **you might run the risk of a $124 citation.**

# if you’re transferring to a bus or another train? 

# should you still tap off? 

**yes!** if you get off a link train without tapping your u-pass, when you tap your u-pass to get on another train, the reader will actually register that as a tap off. if a fare enforcement officer checks your card now, it will show that you haven’t tapped on for your second train. there’s that citation risk **of $124** again.

here is what you should do:

1. tap on before boarding any transit vehicle using your u-pass.
2. if you’re riding on link light rail or a sounder train, tap off at the end of your ride.
3. if you’re transferring, just follow those steps again on the next leg of your trip. that orca technology inside your husky card will be able to tell that you’re transferring. it’s that smart!

another reason for tapping on and tapping off your husky card is to **keep the cost down** for everyone. if you fail to tap off and are charged for a more expensive trip than the one you took, the u-pass program has to pay the difference.

for example, if a u-pass member takes a ride downtown from uw station to do some shopping, the cost of the trip should be about $2.50. but if the u-pass member doesn’t tap off, the program is charged about $3.25.

"am i screwed? tl;dr: how much do i have to pay to cancel my 12-month apartment agreement right now?

i had first signed up for the 9-month dorms, then i was waitlisted so i switched to 12-month apartments, for which i was waitlisted again. i had absolutely no experience with hfs or any college housing (i was freshman last year when everything was online), so this made me pretty anxious the whole process was a hassle to get through.

i ended up finding off-campus housing and signed a 12-month contract for it and moved in last week.

after that, i sent an email to hfs asking to cancel my application, foolishly thinking that they would adjust my account to cancel it without fees like they did when i emailed them regarding my 9-month application. i was afraid to cancel it manually on the hfs home page because i thought they were going to charge me the cancellation fees if i just did it myself. i only recently realized that the reason they asked for my student information in the email interaction was not because they used it to adjust my account, but solely to look at my waiting list status and tell me what i already knew. 

the next part’s on me - i didn’t really check my emails for the past week because i was busy figuring out living in my off-campus apartment and such, and today i checked for the first time in a week just to realize i was apparently assigned a room despite them telling me they didn’t expect to assign me until late autumn quarter, and i’d have to pay full cancellation charges if i wanted to cancel it. 

my question here is what they mean by “$500 + full housing agreement charges.” again, i’m totally inexperienced with hfs, and i sincerely hope this is just a stupid newbie question, but does this mean they want me to pay them the whole ~$5000 that i’d pay if i was using the apartment for the whole year?",advice

i was wondering if anyone has suggestions for places around campus (preferably indoors seeing as were getting into the rainy season) where i can sit, relax, and enjoy my lunch. since i won’t be buying lunch i think that opens up my options to more buildings… i’m just unsure how various buildings feel about open food containers, with the covid policies and all. i’m also not looking for anything too secluded, but also not something with a lot of through-traffic either, if that makes sense. 

any suggestions?

and because of the cold and the rain recently, eating outside isn't an option and eating inside my classes is no longer an option bc of covid 🙃

as an individual who has struggled with an eating disorder for the past 2 years, this is causing me immense stress. i already have such a hard time eating but now i can't even find a place to spend literally 30 minutes to sit and eat 🥲 and i can't eat inside my classes because of covid which already is hard for me as i am forced to not be able to eat during my long lectures and now with my one hour in between i still can't eat 🥲🥲🥲 

i don't know if you guys can relate but it's been so hard for me, why is it so fucking hard to eat and why is everywhere so goddamn crowded at lunch time. i know it's not uws fault but it's killing me man, i don't know what to do.

(edit: for reference; i went to uw for my undergrad and graduated last year so i'm very familiar with campus and places to sit and eat. ive just never seen it like how it is now obviously bc of the pandemic and am struggling 🥲)",discussion

"no outside cups in dining halls i'm a bit confused about the reasoning behind hfs staff saying that they don't want people to bring outside containers to fill with (free) drinks. the reason i heard was that ""we don't know where that bottle has been, and you're touching things"".  
that doesn't make sense to me, because the main point of physical contact between my things and the cafeteria things is my hand, not my bottle/cup. i also don't like wasting materials, even though (as the staff pointed out), they're compostable. compostable containers still take resources to make, transport, and actually compost, and i don't see the need to use more than necessary in this case.

"how do u get friend at uw? i saw posts about two people wanting their bf or gf by trying post on here, but i noticed no one asked how to make friend. 

i mean, i'm slowly recovering from covid quarantine aftermath by trying to be more outgoing and talking to people but i noticed that the friendship doesn't last these days which happens all the time. 

but the fear is still there; i mean after all, i'm transferred senior but i have no experiences of being on campus for longer than a month before this term so i know absolutely no one so far. and really i feel like i got nothing out of this university because of how much opportunity i have lost to network with people. i'm sure most of you feels the same. 

and plus the fact that i'm little older than an average student here doesn't help; most of people immediately dropped me after telling them that i'm turning 26 this year. that literally made me devastated for few days thinking that i literally can't make friend here. everyone is smarter than me and young, and people i encountered were people who wants to talk to people around their age. 

i don't know where to even start. thinking about these just makes me feel pathetic. i know i shouldn't complain, but i ran out of idea. i tried talking to classmate, posting things here, going to club, and overall tried my hardest to engage with them but it wasn't any useful. at this point it feels like i'm thrown in a cell except i can freely go home.

"screwed up schedule hi y'all,

i'm suppose to graduate this spring and i only have 5 class left to take, not including this quarter.   
my problem is, i was planning on taking these two classes at the same time next quarter (class a and class b). but, i just learned that class a is actually a prereq for class b.   


i'm currently freaking out because i was not aware of this, nor did my advisors let me know despite me going to them for academic help. i do not want to wait a whole year to graduate just to take one class. if i were to take class a next quarter and then class b, i'll end up being a whole quarter behind because class b is a series class that requires me to take one more class after it (class c).   


i already emailed my advisors about this situation but do yall think i'll be able to still take both classes at the same time? class b has three class prereqs that i needed to take, two of which i already took and did above a 3.0 on. class a is the third class in a series and which i did very well on in the first two quarters.",academics

"it's that time again; guys if you're going to approach a girl in public, here's how to do it we're back on campus and haven't talked to people on campus in over a year. it's weird and we're all socially (and probably touch) deprived. if you want to make friends or find a potential partner, chances are you've considered the cold-approach of just walking up to a cute stranger and asking them out.

for reasons you may never fully understand, this can be scary for women. always has been, always will. as a woman who's had this happen a not-insignificant number of times, it really depends on the situation. sometimes it's straight-up predatory, and even if you aren't a creep, we still have to be prepared for that. we get that some people are really trying to be nice, but it's awkward because of the timing/location/lack of social skills so here's some advice:

the best of intentions can still make moments like this plenty upsetting! pick your time/place carefully-- if she's near the front of a 30 min line at the suzzalo starbucks, she's not going to be able to leave if she feels uncomfortable. also 9am is a little early to get hit on, at least let her finish her coffee.

don't open with a comment on physical appearance (unless it's to compliment a specific piece of clothing or pin or something you have in common). we already know that's what got your attention. you can work in a compliment whilst flirting, but don't start there-- there are plenty of things more interesting about her than her physical appearance, and she'll be very impressed if you manage to convey that in the first 20 seconds. instead, start with a greeting that gives her a chance to answer how she's doing and importantly, if this is a good time to talk (you're not more important than cramming for a midterm, so if that's what's happening at the library then don't drag it out). if you get a conversation going, offer small bits of information like what/where your housing is or what your year/major is-- just things that turn you into a real person in her head instead of a random stranger from who-knows-where). keep this convo brief-- even if she seems interested, a) she's probably also still in the middle of something, and b) you don't want to play your whole hand at once-- leave her wondering more about you. the more you talk the more likely it is she'll hear something that kills her interest. if your goal is a date, wait til then before you start diving into how compatible you might be.

now for your exit strategy-- this is the most important part. even if it's going well, if it's not a good time or she seems uncomfortable here's what you should say/do: ""anyways, i'm \[insert name here\], i should probably get going but i'd really like to get to know you better. can i give you my number/snapchat?"" (if you managed to find a common hobby, invite her to participate in said hobby with you). and then here's the kicker- do not give her your phone or ask for hers. give your number/snap to her on a piece of paper, old-fashioned style (but write it out in front of her so it doesn't look like you've been handing out business cards to every other girl). you don't really have to wait for an answer, just hand it to her/leave it on the table, and make a swift exit (throw in a ""have a nice day"" or even a ""talk to you later!"" if you're feeling bold).

it may catch her off guard, but in a good way-- it'll make you stand out and seem classier, more like the male lead of her fave 2000s rom com and less like someone who just hits on girls as a hobby and collects numbers like pokemon cards. this also gives her the chance to decide if she's interested without the fear of someone she doesn't know having her contact information, or having someone hover over her to make that decision on the spot. less of a chance of a knee-jerk ""no"" reaction. if she's interested, she'll reach out. if not, drop it. you don't want to chase after someone who isn't interested in you anyways.

a few final notes on flirting/the conversation itself:  
\- confidence is by far the most important thing-- if you seem nervous, she's gonna think you're swinging out of your league and she shouldn't settle (related-- don't swing out of your league; aka don't pick the hottest person you see, pick someone who might pick you too)

\- smile and try to get her to smile; you don't have to be funny but be nice

\- plan what you're going to ask her before you approach, but don't try to memorize a script-- find something specific about her to ask about, it's much easier for her to talk about herself than follow a random topic of conversation

\- again, keep it brief. the longer you interrupt her day, the greater the chance of annoying her to saying no for reasons unrelated to your charms

finally, this is not the ideal way to meet someone-- you should really use this as a last resort if you don't have any opportunities to meet people in your classes or at a club meeting or through friends

y'all are gonna shoot your shot anyways though so hopefully this'll save everyone involved from a very awkward encounter. good luck gents",advice

with the track i am on, i won't finish all of my foster pre-reqs until the end of my sophomore year. also, because of personal reasons, i performed poorly during spring 2020 which brought down my gpa. so my advisor suggested i don't apply until they can see my grades even for pre-admission courses. i was wondering if i could complete pre-reqs for communications while still trying to get into foster. but i don't have a ton of info on how competitive communications is. i can't apply for econ because i tried math 124 twice and had to drop out both times. my only other option would be to transfer to a college where my parents are and finish my degree there. which is always an option, but i want to keep that as a last resort. does anyone have any other suggestions?

i spoke with my advisor and although she was nice, i didn't get much guidance. all she did was give me websites i had already been looking at. she told me to explore the list of majors and think about where/what i want my career to look like. respectfully, i have been doing what she suggested long before i spoke with her and i still have no fucking clue. i think a big part of my worry is also that i just don't feel confident in my ability to succeed in any of my courses or get into any major. i think it's holding me back, i just can't shake that feeling. any tips on how to fix that would be much appreciated too!

"cse 142 vs. cse 160 i finally decide to take a cse class to learn something useful for winter 2022, but i can't make a choice. here are my thoughts:

***cse 142***

* two class sections, 11:30am and 3:30pm
* larger class size, great professor
* seems more popular among undergrad

***cse 160***

* seems less harsh and complicated than cse 142
* new cse building classroom
* only section is mwf 3:30pm–4:20pm

i've been pretty hesitant to upload anything regarding to friendship thread on this subreddit because it's usually used for academic specific, or just people trying to gather for specific purpose. but seeing and knowing that everyone is also seeking for some sort of connection here made me relieved and know that i'm not alone here. 

so i'd decided to be little different (although it's not original idea) and creative about making connection; making this post to be a self introduction thread where you comment your brief introduction about yourself on this thread and reply to people that you are interested in being friend with. and if you got replies from people on your intro, you could possibly take your discussion in dm 👌

i'd start off myself for the intro:

my name is jae, who is transferred senior and going to turn 26 next month. currently in communication major, and pursuing entrepreneurship minor. i like that i'm easy going, understanding and try to be considerate. i'm little shy and can be awkward time to time but i like to think myself that i'm fun person to be around. i laugh a lot so maybe some of my happy energy might pass onto u 😀
i also play drums and spend quite a bit of time listening to music. if you are ever interested talking about musics or video games, let's vibe 👌 feel free to pm me if you are interested 👀

"ultimate guide to uw seattle campus (registration, buildings) as the registration for winter 2022 begins, you will take another batch of classes at different locations. however, college campus is huge compared to high school campus. here's my ultimate guide on how to not get lost on uw campus. i divide the uw seattle campus into six regions: up north, montlake east, red square, fountain, waterfront southwest, and far south.  


**the up north region (6)**

* ***buildings***: *parrington hall (par), denny hall (den), paccar hall (pcar), dempsey hall (dem), hutchinson hall (hut), and bank of america executive education center (exed)*.
* ***tips***: buildings at the up north region are typically on the top of the hill, which you need to walk or run uphill from anywhere on the campus. except for parrington hall, all the buildings are next to each other. i recommend you walk fast, not run, when going uphill so you can save more energy before class starts.

**the montlake east region (8)**

* ***buildings***: *loew hall (low), mechanical engineering building (meb), mueller hall (mue), more hall (mor), bill & melinda gates cse center (cse2), thomson hall (tho), clark hall (clk), and communications building (cmu)*.
* ***tips***: mostly downhill, except for the segment of east stevens way from mueller hall to loew hall. those building are the closest to the ima fields and building but far away from the ave. some recitation sections or seminar-style classes are held at either loew hall, mechanical engineering building, or thomson hall. if you do not want to walk uphill, then take bus route 372 or 75 and get off by padelford hall. not recommend using the burke-gilman trail, you will climb lots of stairs (unless you like it).

**the red square region (9)**

* ***buildings***: *kane hall (kne), savery hall (sav), gowen hall (gwn), smith hall (smi), miller hall (mlr), raitt hall (rai), music building (mus), art building (art), and meany hall (mny)*.
* ***tips***: since these buildings are clustered around the red square, so there will be lots of people walking around from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. when walking at the red square region, please walk gently while speedy, and don't push or mess up the crowds. bricks at the red square can be slippery at times, be cautious. also, from kane hall to art building is a hill.

**the fountain region (10)**

* ***buildings***: *mary gates hall (mgh), sieg hall (sig), johnson hall (jhn), bagley hall (bag), guggenheim hall (gug), electrical and computer engineering building (ece), chemistry library building (chl), nano science building (nan), atmospheric science-geophysics building (atg), benson hall (bns) and chemistry building (chb).* 
* ***tips***: hill climbings at johnson-mary gates hall walkway and rainier vista. if you're going from ece building to miller hall, you need to speed walk. walking fast at an uphill slope is easier than downhill. mary gates hall has multiple exits on the first floor. walking towards the hub-sieg area and making turns to avoid the crowds. for those classes at either bns, chl, atg, or bag, take the west stevens way to the red square or west campus dorms and buildings.

**the waterfront southwest region (11)**

* ***buildings***: *marine studies building (mar), fishery science building (fsh), fisheries teaching building (ftr),  hitchcock hall (hck), physics/astronomy auditorium (paa), physics/astronomy building (pab), kincaid hall (kin), condon hall (cdh), gould hall (gld), architecture hall (arc), and social work building (sws)*.
* ***tips***: they're far away, and i do not recommend having another class at those buildings back-to-back (paa and pab are not terrible in term of the distance). if you have to take it here, then you could either speed walk, jog, or come late to the class (not recommended), especially for the fishery science building. hitchcock hall is located next to life science building and kincaid hall, the second overpass bridge from the west. for condon hall, take the 41st street to avoid traffic lights. for gould hall, jaywalk campus parkway and take the overpass. 

**the far south region (6)**

* ***buildings***: *bloedel hall (bld), anderson hall (and), wickenwerder forest lab (wfs), health science tower (hst), health science building (hsb), and roberts hall (rob)*.
* ***tips***: far away. walk fast or jog.",student life

do you guys feel like you're here because you want to be, or because you're obligated to be?

i'm struggling a lot lately with a nagging feeling of discontent. i'm from a small town, and seattle is just not my vibe. i applied to lots of schools, but uw was the only reasonably priced option for me with financial aid - which was taken away after my freshman year (last year...) didn't go well because of covid and being isolated in my dorm room 24/7. i hate that my parents are paying my way this year, and i miss the summer when i lived at home, actually worked and made money, and came home to - shocker - no work, no homework, no stress. i was finally becoming independent and spending time with my family, but i was convinced to come back and try college again this year because 'it'll be different from last year.'

i'm just curious if anyone else is feeling just... dissatisfied, really. like this is really pointless or not doing anything for you. why is that? what are your solutions and thoughts? transfer to another school, transfer out of school into a trade or apprenticeship, just taking a couple years off to work and find yourself... whaddaya think? and if you used to feel that way but have found inspiration, what is it that drives you to succeed here?",advice

this is mildly frustrating normally but you can kind of work with it, just lay low for a few days after the exam and get a covid test. however the next exam is the day before thanksgiving. many students are concerned about contracting covid during the exam and then exposing their families when they go home. is there anything we can do other than just take the l and not show up to the exam?",advice

i understand that this is unusual and that ucs prioritize transfers from california community colleges. if i do really well at uw and apply to transfer by the time i get the credits, what are my chances?",academics

* what's the student teaching application/selection process like? and what is it like when you're actually in the teaching program? i asked the program advisor this in an email when i was first applying and received no response yet.

i am a sophomore right now. since i got into uw, i had been craving for getting into foster school of business. my average prerequisite gpas are pretty low, like something around 3.4-3.6. though i got into my intended major (economics) this quarter, i felt myself failing compared with friends who got into foster.
 

i have a high self-esteem, and i never feel myself achieved something. foster is definitely one of the majors which hold tons of resources, and i do not want to give up even there is a slim chance. it has been a month that i have been struggling with my inner self on the topic of applying foster.
 

it is likely i would fail my foster application next spring since i even don’t have high prereq gpa. i cannot sleep, eat, and even speak well nowadays, and i am making myself stressed out. i do not have enthusiasm anymore, and i just want to stay at my room all the time. every night i had crisis of studying when i go to bed, and i woke up at 3 with same crisis.
 

i am kinda desperate right now. some friends have comforted me multiple times on the major topic, but i just cannot let it go easily. how should i tell myself to calm down and go with it? please…

"running start to uw cs major i want to get into the uw cs major and am currently doing running start.

\-what courses and pathways should i prioritize to increase chances of getting into the cs major?

\-is there any advantage to completing an associate's degree?

\-should i take time to complete an associate's degree over doing high-level math and physics courses?

\*

\*

after lots of research, i have found that if you want to be a uw cs major as a running start student it is most important that you get the cs major [prerequisites](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/currentuw) finished ([with nearly perfect grades](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/transfer)) so you can enroll for direct admission into the cs major as a freshman because as of 2019 the cs major became a [predominantly direct admission major](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm). you should only go for an associate's degree if you have enough leftover classes after finishing the prerequisites for the cs major with high grades. an associate's degree is good for your resume and working before you get your bachelor's. i don't think most people will work at more than minimum wage jobs until after completing their major anyways, making the associate's degree seem nearly pointless for uw cs majors. after completing the prerequisites it is important to get as many [cs major graduation requirements](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/ugrad/curriculum/cs_reqs_wi22.pdf) as your community college offers as possible to finish the required courses at an easier and cheaper college.

from the title it probably seems like i’m insecure about my grades and feeling like i’m behind everyone academically, but i’m actually pretty confident in my intellect. what i am insecure about it the way i dress. lemme explain . . .

ok so i’m a cs major and we all know the stereotypes about cs majors being lazy and dressing in gross t-shirt and jeans. now that’s partially true, but not everyone dresses that way. i, for one, like to dress up whether that’s at school or outside. but for some reason i feel like as a woman in stem i’m judged for it.

a few weeks ago i dressed up a little more than usual. nothing crazy i just put in more effort in my makeup and outfit. i felt so good and was so happy that day until i walked into my cs lecture. a group of guys were looking at me in a way that seemed super judgmental. out of the 120 people in that room i heard at least 25 ish people scoff and stare at my outfit. that doesn’t seem like much but it made me nervous. some of them were girls too which just made me sad. i had a pretty bad panic attack and went home early. that day i went straight home and came back the next day in a plain sweatshirt and jeans.

here’s my dilemma: my mom surprised me with a beautiful and i mean beautiful tote bag that i’ve been wanting for some time. problem is it looks pretty “grown up” and “dressed up”. i feel like people will just make fun of me again and i’m scared to wear it. my mom was so happy to give it to me though it makes me so sad that i’m hesitating to wear it.

why are people just so mean sometimes?

i followed a couple of youtubers, and i just found out that many of them didn’t attend college but still earned a great deal of money. what’s more important is that they enjoy what they are doing. whenever i compare my life to theirs, i feel even more lost. i feel like they are successful because they know what they are doing, and they enjoy it while earning money.

needless to say this quarter hasn't really made things better for my sleeping habits, and i know a lot of folks are also struggling with maintaining a normal schedule. to anyone reading this at 2 am, i feel your pain.

has anyone got any suggestions for how to go to sleep and wake up at a better time?

1. have an enjoyable part to your morning routine like watching a short youtube video while sipping your cup of coffee
2. cut off or reschedule late-night habits which includes screens
3. reduce screen time in the evening in general
4. make a habit of brushing your teeth, showering, etc. significantly earlier than you go to bed so you feel like you can just slump in at any time
5. read a (paper) book for 20 minutes or so half an hour before your ideal bed time

"how much of a “college experience” can be had living near campus i despise commuting. i commuted this year for financial reasons and wish i didn’t have to. i never have time to finish homework. my only social interaction with uw students was through instagram pages or study groups, and even then, i would leave campus with most of my work unfinished and come home too tired to finish it. i have no time to attend club meetings either. i want to live on or near campus but i am debating whether to dorm or live in a studio. i don’t know anyone who is looking for a roommate for one thing. for another i want to have some semblence of a traditional college experience. i was “homeschooled” from k-12 at a hybrid parent/school system teaching resource center, and never got to develop socially as i would have in a normal school, as it was next to impossible to be anywhere without your parent or someone elses breathing down your back. most people there were neurodivergent (i am as well, but an environment of 100% nds is… something) or religiously fanatic, and that didn’t help things. i made the mistake of doing running start. i spent three years only to come out with 60 relevant credits, no breathing room for electives to fill the gaps between courses at uw, a social environment worse than high school, and crippled mental health. (i never saw my mental health improve faster than the period immediately after i left community college) i am technically a junior but in standing i am a sophomore. i desperately want to meet people, attend a few parties, and feel like i am part of my university community. at the same time i recognize that hfs provides pretty piss poor value for money, and that a studio would be substantially cheaper than living on campus. there are plenty of options near uw, and it would allow me to stay on campus to work longer, and attend club meetings. it would give me much more privacy and comfort as well.

as uw starts the first week via online, i believe that this may be helpful for students who are creating their online class discord communities. this tool authenticates students using their uwnetid. upon authenticating, they will be given a predefined role in the class discord. the role may be used to grant additional access to the server. this is so that that only students and/or other uw affiliated people with a uwnetid may access their class discords. there is an optional logging mechanic which may also be used so that the one who created the server may know which student is whom in the server for additional security.

[demo: the process to authenticate into the server](https://preview.redd.it/y40s5sbau5981.png?width=2102&format=png&auto=webp&s=84dbdec42a9fdda3581678731ef1674bf7401240)

does that mean they are technically “harmless” so long as they are paid before then? does accepting the subsidized loans and paying them off before the gov-paid interest expires cost me any more than not taking the loans out at all?

my objective is to not have to pay anything extra in the long run, but accept the loans if i can to have more financial breathing space. if the loans will cost me more even if they’re paid off before the graduation grace period ends, i’d rather just pay them now and live frugally each quarter.

i was a direct admit to engrud but was placed into ece (i know it can be used, etc etc but i'm far more passionate about the content covered in cmpe). 

i know people work super hard and get rejected so i am sure it is pretty hopeless but thought i might ask for a second opinion if i choose to reapply:

* gpa: my gpa was tanked with covid and especially phys 12x and family situations - it was absolutely brutal. my gpa is a 3.1 at the moment. >\_<
* cs courses: 
   * i have taken cse 142, 143 (while the grades aren't super high, they are higher than all my other grades by far except vlpa, div, w)
   * cse 190: lab that went with cse 142 and helped with fundamentals
   * cse 390h: i was one of 18 students to take an honors cs course with professor reges where he talked about how cs people approach problems, common issues, etc.
   * cse 331: i was lucky and secured a spot today in this course (i really wanted it and worked super hard to get into it with my petition, emails, etc)
   * cse 373: also taking this course this quarter with kevin lin - so far, i really enjoy the content.
* research
   * i am currently a member in a research lab of 100+ people and have quickly became a high ranking technical writer with grant proposals being funded for the lab.
   * i am also the finalist in two competitions for a project i'm working on (i am working with 1 other but i am definitely pulling my own weight for the competitions). it is quick possible this project is becoming a startup within the next month, in which case i will be a startup leader? that's wild.
* extracurriculars
   * i am currently the director of a hackathon that is later this year and leading committees, securing sponsors, obtained mlh status, etc. i have spearheaded this.
   * i am an ece ta where i work with assignments, exams, course materials, etc.
   * i have continuously worked since sophomore year in high school and have worked at a grocery store since the start of covid for 20hrs a week
* internship
   * i am desperately trying to get one and just got the book cracking the coding interview to assist with interviews
* family
   * i have a disabled sibling that i also help my family care for 3 days a week. :)
* high school stuff
   * fbla president and 4 statewide awards and national finalist
   * asb treasurer, link crew, nhs, tri-m honor society
   * 3.7 gpa and then 4.42 gpa weighted
   * 12 ap courses with scholarship with distinction twice, even during covid senior year
   * orchestra
   * a killer personal statement

i have very strong writing skills so i am sure my personal statement would be as good as possible - but i do not feel my application is enough (will it ever be?) i only discovered my passion for cs when i got to uw and i am so annoyed - i feel i was a stronger applicant back before covid, when i applied to uw (but regrets dont help)

hence this post now exists. y'all can drop your tips and aspirations and whatever else below too! maybe some of you guys can end up being friends in the comments and whatnot--that would be neat. anyways, how have y'all been? i haven't posted here since graduating so uh... ye!

**tl;dr: self-reflection, addressing stressors within my control, making things easier for future me (and then thanking past me), reducing screen time, making my bed, and trying to get to bed at a reasonable time.**

senior year was really rough for me... aside from general stress of being sleep deprived and attempting to barely manage my courseload, i had a pretty awful break up; the place i worked at was closed down thanks to uw's upper management; the restaurant i started working at afterwards closed down after three months thanks to covid; and lastly, i had the honor of being part of the 1st graduating covid class with all the profs scrambling and having no idea how to really teach online or handle our senior projects that was basically required to be in-person to have any sort of value... xd

honestly, not much kept me going and i basically hit rock bottom. i really wanted to drop out multiple times during senior year, but knowing all the physical/mental/financial sacrifices i (and my parents) made for the sake of my education stopped me from doing so even though each day felt like hell (and i did heavily debate on yeeting myself... still a work in progress...shhh).

anyhow, there's no need to pretend to be okay. in fact, it's totally fine and normal to not be okay, especially given current circumstances going on in our world. your feelings are very valid. personally, what's been keeping me going is uhhh... bruh, idek--most of the time, i'm just barely scraping by. i guess i have a lofty goal of retiring early (~35-40 y/o) one day to figure out what i actually wanna do with my life because i still got no idea... perhaps i'll write/illustrate some children's books or maybe open a cozy bookstore/cafe/bar/makerspace or volunteer at a library or plant nursery or maybe do all of them?! the possibilities are endless if you got time (and access to money/resources depending on what you wanna do).

as for how i've been coping, i been trying to reduce screen time outside my job, spend more time doing arts & crafts, check in with myself through journaling/self-reflection, take walks in nature when possible, and make a point to make my bed each day before i sleep (so future me will appreciate it)! i been also getting into plant propagation and seeing plants in my vicinity indoors has been making me feel a bit better overall. :)

when things get too overwhelming, i'll write down everything that's been stressing me out, whether it's in or out of my control--and if it is within my control, what i can do about it now and make a plan as to how to go about to tackling it. now, the hard part is generally executing it and i got nothing for you on that aside from developing your self-discipline, making the task look less daunting by divvying it up to even smaller parts (e.g. write an essay = turn on laptop, login to account, read the essay prompt in full, research topic & gather relevant resources, write outline, write first paragraph, etc.), or just forcing yourself to do it for a minimum of 15 minutes (usually starting is harder that actually doing it imo)... the easier you make it for future you, the more likely you'll do it. :')

anyways, i believe in ya op (and the rest y'all too)!! just a few more months and the weather should be less gloomy and all of you will have either graduated or gotten through another year!! :d

p.s. maybe also take some vitamin d supplements cause how little sunlight we get in the winter months. :')",advice

"should i take micro econ 200 w/ wenqiu ma? i’m currently an art major (drawing+ painting) and i minor in business in entrepreneurship because i originally wanted to become a freelance artist in the future. lately i decided after i graduate that i want to just apply to gaming/film companies instead. 

i’ve been looking through other minors and sadly nothing else interests me.. 

since i have to take 4 more classes i need to take outside my art department (one of the requirements) should i just try random classes for the next upcoming quarters, (drop my business minor) or just try this class first and see if i like it. 

if anyone has took any micro econ classes i would appreciate any help. the reviews seemed mix, but overall i just want an easy class outside my 2 other art classes. thank you guys :)",academics
"why there are no resubmissions in cse 143 (hunter schafer)? i am not sure why they are not offering resubmissions and simulated exams this quarter. because in the previous quarter's (hunter schafer, au 21) course website says that the course had resubmissions and not-real exams. 

also, i took cse 142 the previous quarter, and it had resubmissions and simulated exams. because of those two factors, i succeeded in this course.

if this quarter does not have resubmissions and simulated exams but previous quarters did, isn't it unfair that students who studied quarters with resubmissions have a higher chance to get the desired grade than the students who studied quarters without resubmissions and simulated exams? moreover, when it comes to admission to cs major or any other major, they will only consider grades, not professors taught in that particular quarter.

in addition, the ""additional offering of cse143 available"" email, specifically says that this course (with hunter schafer) will run independently of the current course (with stuart reges). but in reality, they both have the same grading system, no resubmission policy, and in-person exams.

now, normally i would be fine with this. but, i've had a number of groups in the past where group members just don't check the canvas discussions posts regularly enough to do group work by it. so, i sent out emails to start things going, off canvas. i made a reply on the canvas discussion just to let people know i sent out an email in case someone happened to check the group page before seeing the email. most members have responded to the email and would prefer text/zoom to work on the assignment. i went back to the canvas discussion just to check it and the prof replied to me and again requested that group communication *only* take place on canvas.

i've been doing college and using canvas for over 5 years now and never had a teacher make this request before. i find it really odd. i feel bad ignoring them and am afraid they will dock us points since they have been so explicit about the request. can i just tell them ""no thanks""? it's a purely online class so i think the prof just wants to be able to spy on the whole process and not be left out. my philosophy is tough luck for them, give us the assignment and let us go work on it. anybody else been in a similar situation?",discussion

"has anyone ever been “reported” to the communications chair? what usually comes of that? a summary of what happened that lead to it:

every week we have about 3 readings and 4 assignments every week. this week, in addition to those assignments and readings we also had a paper due. two days before the paper was due i sent him an email and asked him about if in next class we could have a group discussion and see about possibly not having to do one of those assignments only the next week that we have a paper due, since this week was a bit overwhelming and i was wondering if it was the same for other students or if it was just me. (the initial email i sent him was super chill, and reading it you could tell it was just a student who was stressed out).

when he responded, his first sentence was “i’m not sure what you’re trying to convey in this email but,” then listed out 1-5 (like a literal list) how this is the collage life and i need to get used to it, i should have said something when the assignment was given, i’ve had the syllabus so i should have planned ahead, etc. etc. and i’m summing it up so more went into it, but the way he worded things, he was clearly talking down to me and i felt like i was being belittled.
so i replied (angerly, i’ll admit) about how i didn’t see why he needed to talk down to me, i was just asking about a possibility, and i have other classes with other assignments and i simply wasn’t able to plan how overwhelmed i’d be, i thought i could handle it. i have only a quarter left in my senior year you know?

bottom line, he didn’t like my response and said his “writing style and how he choose to convey things is his choice” and he will not let me talk about this situation next class (i said i wanted to get other students feelings about the assignments) and that he reported me to “the chair of communication and academic advisor”

so i’m just wondering.. does anyone know what’ll happen?

edit: i also want to add after he told me he reported me, he said “good luck on your paper” and i’m kind of worried to submit things to him now and that this issue is going to affect my grade. so i haven’t turned it in yet (he actually extended the due date to tonight because 2 other students asked)",advice
"abt the crime in the area i’m originally from a city with high rates of murders and whatnot. talking like once i was walking down the street, there were firefighters taking down an arson fire in one building and cops dealing with a hostage situation in the building next door. i’ve been shot at a couple times too. so i think i have good advice. 

so, here’s my advice to avoid these crimes happening in the area. 

if you go anywhere, go with three or more people. don’t go out alone after sunset. 

because the weapon being used is a taser, you can run. don’t even try to fight, throw your valuable items onto the ground and just run. 

a lot of people believe these are human traffickers. most traffickers just lure young people in and manipulate them over a long period of time. these are robbers, they don’t want your body, they want your stuff. 

if these people talk to you, speak in a slow clear voice and say exactly what you’re going to do in every motion, “i am going to hand you my cell phone/keys/whatever.” you absolutely do not want them to think you are a threat, as they will just attack you. 

if you are restrained or fear they are going to move you to a second location, then you start freaking out. scream, flail, act wildly. be so inconvenient that they don’t want to mess with you. attract so much attention, they have to drop you.

last resort if you think someone is following you, start filming and confront them and tell them to stop following you. this is really a last resort. if there’s no one around to help you and you feel you can’t outrun them, this is your final call. 

if they don’t stop following you, act like a crazy, mentally insane person. like foaming, gurgling, off the rocker insanity. they will not want to be anywhere near you. 

this is my advice, i hope you guys find it helpful!",advice

"prospective uw grad student from nyc: seattle social dynamics hi! i'm considering moving to seattle since i've been accepted into a ph.d. program at the university of washington. of course, i plan to visit the city myself since i have never been, however, i'm getting a lot of polarizing opinions about the city. i currently live in manhattan nyc and have lived here for 6 years. i attended university in nyc and currently work in the city. fun facts: i'm 25 y/o, a black person, single and i'll be studying within the stem field. i'm mostly interested in the social dynamics of the city; i keep hearing about the ""seattle freeze"" and considering i don't know anyone and would be building up a friend group from scratch, that's a big concern. although, i think the graduate component will help. i have a good amount of confidence in my academic program, however, i'm more worried about the social dynamics since that appears to be a point of contention for many transplants. grad school in my case is a 4-6 year commitment and i want to ensure i make an informed decision before uprooting. can people share what the young mid-twenties people are like here? what do people tend to do for fun? what's the dating scene like for straight women? what would be a better neighborhood to live in proximity to the university? any you're willing to share at this point would be appreciated",student life
"therapy resources for students i’ve been falling into neative feedback loops over things i can no longer control. i feel horrendously socially stunted. i had a pretty good childhood, but i feel like my parents made certain choices that artificially limited my growth. i’ve missed out on so many milestones most people have in high school, and a lot of social milestones i met in high school are things that most people meet in elementary school. i’m really unhappy with the path i took into college. i feel like i could have had choices in what i studied and where i went, but had to settle with the one decent school that would take me, and the only open major that interested me, because i squandered my ability to get into closed majors in running start. as a mixture of covid, i feel like i missed out entirely on the first stage of adulthood. i thought i’d prefer living at home, but i feel like not dorming has put me even further behind my peers who are at least starting to live independently. i realize it’s meaningless in the grand scheme of life, but i really wish i gave myself a traditional freshman experience to make up for all the traditional milestones i didn’t meet in k-12. i don’t really want to dorm next year because i’d feel weird about doing it as a 21 year old. i know many people had shitty dorm experiences, but most of my friends are having a lot of fun with that traditional experience, and it makes me feel left out sometimes.

i keep falling into negative feedback loops like this one. they are triggered by the most mundane of things and when they are triggered i have no way to consciously control them. i only stop spiraling through equally mundane things, like  the sunlight looking particularly nice, or having a good time with a friend.  i’m tired of pitying myself, trauma dumping on friends, and ranting on reddit. i want to see a therapist. i don’t want to on my parents insurance because a lot of the things i’ve been falling into negative feedback loops over were in part their choices, and i don‘t want to upset them. this isn’t like when i was suicidally depressed in high school where i could chock it entirely as me wanting to deal with chemical imbalance. i also am considering a career as a commercial pilot, and any mental health diagnosis has the potential to be disqualifying. are there any confidential resources i can see that are either cheap or free? i have a couple thousand dollars saved but i have no idea how many sessions that gets me",student life

"whip man origin story once, there was a man who lived in the washington countryside. he worked on a farm, and overall had a great life. his favorite hobby was cracking whips, especially in the dead of night, to see if he could still hit his targets with barely a sliver of moonlight.

however, one day he was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease which would leave both his arms paralyzed, preventing him from ever cracking a whip again. heartbroken, he resolved to perfect his craft, before finally succumbing to his fate.

but late one evening he received a knock on his door, and a shadowy figure with a husky by his side spoke to him. ""we know what ails you. we have heard of cases like yours, and we may be able to help you. there is a... machine, at our university. an experimental machine. it transfers part of the wellbeing of an organ into another, at the expense of the health of the source. we have helped people before, though never cases as severe as yours. as this machine is not yet approved, we would appreciate it if you spoke of this to no one. but know that we may be able to help you.""

the man, of course, agreed. he would willingly trade almost anything for the ability to crack whips for the rest of his life, it being his greatest passion. and so he moved onto the university of washington campus temporarily to receive his treatment. it never bothered him that the source organ of the machine's health transfer was not noted.

over the next weeks, this man felt his arms growing stronger, too strong, he thought that the machine must have completed its treatment, but he believed he could aquire muscles superior to those before by continuing treatment, so he chose to deceive the scientists operating the experimental machine, and told them his muscles were deteriorating further.

this continued for several months, and the man slowly felt his senses fade, he believed it was simply the contrast relative to the newfound strength of his arms. then his consciousness began to slip. then his understanding of who he was. for what the scientists had neglected to mention was that the only organ powerful enough to draw energy from was the brain.

after three missed treatments, the scientists checked on the man's residence late at night to find the inside of the apartment smashed and slashed beyond recognition. one of the windows had been thrown open, and another had been pulverized. horrified, the scientists checked to see outside the window. they were never heard of again, and the machine they had created was eventually lost to time.

it's said his spirit still haunts the ave, and that at night you can hear a soft whip occasionally cracking, intermingling with the tinkling of the rusted doorbells.",discussion

i thought people weren’t serious when they said most students at uw could afford to live on campus. so far, almost every person i’ve met lives on campus. 

anyway, i did cashiering today at noodle, as opposed to my usual prep job, and i was shocked. 

almost every single student had $800+ dollars on their husky card. 

like, i’m assuming it’s not the exact same exchange rate as usd, it’s just husky money, but damn! the rich people at this school can afford to have anything they want, whenever! 

i’m not saying it’s bad to be rich, i’m just shocked by how different uw is from cc. like, most students don’t work and go to school. most students live on campus. most have 100s of dollars a quarter for high quality food. 

uw is a culture shock for me, in terms of wealth. anyone else relate to this?

edit:

i do know many people take out loans to live here, i was just noting how many people i have met that have been so casually wealthy that they don’t seem to process it. this post is not about scholarship loan students.  

for example, several people in my class told me how their parents pay for their entire tuition and everything else for them. again, not bad, but i just felt so surprised by how common that is here. it’s interesting to me.

double edit: 

once again, i’m directly referring to the casually wealthy students i see. the canada goose jackets, the patagonia coats, the lv wallets. 

all my food is from work or the food bank, i am a low income student observing the environment i have been placed in. if that is offensive to you, that’s fine.

"something that i’ve come to the realisation of regarding college it’s pretty much all hard work and no play. i can’t really cut corners because then i’m not satisfied with my understanding and application of the material. i have to put in the work even if it is uncomfortable. most of my life i got by with my intuition and natural intellect, but now everyone at college is pretty much that way, and i have to make sure i keep up with the school of fish even if it doesn’t mean i necessarily stand out. and even if i am a da to my major and heard that once people get in then they relax when it comes to studying and grades, i just feel a personal obligation to make sure that i put in the full work and make sure i at least am above a 3.5. because i’m one of the few people in my extended family pursuing a bachelor’s degree and pretty much everyone is counting on me. (yeah i’m mestizo, and my dad always says my ancestors were hard-working people.)

when it comes to core classes for my major, my grades range from 2.7 upwards (as is the case for average grades regarding the core cse, phys, and math classes, i don’t know how some students can beat the curve), but all my other grades (like for vlpa, i&s) are all above 3.5. i feel that it’s because while my general knowledge in other subjects is quite strong, my core knowledge needs to improve a little. and even if i have the option to drop my lowest scores, or that exams and final grades are curved up, i should still put in my best effort.

just a realization i came to, seeing that pretty much everyone around me has internalized this mindset and i felt it’s time i shook off my sheltered complacency and adopt it as well.

and i also feel like better sleep, nutrition, and meds have helped me realize this too, now that i’m not constantly battling ocd and anxiety i feel i can do better now.",student life

"loneliness, and kurzgesagt seattle isn't a very outgoing city. over the past few months i've seen people make posts on this community about having difficulty making friends, not feeling engaged with the community, being depressed, and so on. this has been echoed in conversations i've had with people as well.

i've struggled with the feeling of loneliness myself, even though i am objectively not lonely anymore (thanks to my excellent friends, love you guys, if you know who i am accept a virtual bro hug).

however, the feeling (which still hits everyone sometimes) hurts all the same, and i can sympathize with everyone who feels it most or all the time. i was there too, but it can get better.

this video by kurzgesagt is excellent at explaining the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3xv_g3g-ma

i strongly encourage anyone who regularly feels lonely to watch it, heck i think everyone should watch it, even people who never feel lonely, if only to understand the feeling many of our little community deal with on a daily basis.

stay strong, friends. you've got this!

"uw ms in data science (msds): a review i have not found many places to review the uw masters in data science program on the internet, so figured it might belong here. note: msds during covid may not be what it once was or what it might be in the future.

if you majored in cse at the uw and expect the same level of quality in your masters do not apply to msds. the program has largely **not** met expectations and many of my peers feel the same way. 

teaching: boring, slow, with (sometimes) less qualified professors.  
expecting this program to be connected to cse uw i imagined some overlap between the cse professors and data classes, this was not the case. i understand that uw cse has its own masters, however many professors dont even come from uw itself, with the ones that do coming from the stats and biostats departments. many of the lectures i experienced were 4 hour slogs in which the msds discord was alight with people joking to pass the time and planning where they were going to get dinner. some even expressed that they teach themselves most topics through khan academy...   
for a major which is part stats and part computer science this program does not bring enough computer science faculty onboard, considering it is attached to the uw name.

community: vibrant, fun, interesting  
on the upside, msds has amazing cohorts, people are excited to join and network but also plan fun nights out. something that surprised me when i joined was that there were only around 5 people actually from uw in the program, with many coming from overseas or out of state. generally nothing bad to say about the students, all of them are bright and passionate.

i dont want to spend time slandering uw msds or its faculty, i wish this review only to point out the discrepancy between uw's amazing cse department and what i feel to be an underdeveloped data science program. uw msds attaches itself heavily to the uw name but the courses dont have any uw cse professors or use the same cse buildings for lectures, in reality the only connected cse event we have are the recruiting fairs, which have largely been decimated by covid. 

i hope this review becomes useless when uw decides to invest in its msds program more but i want masters students to know what they are paying for when deciding to give up 35k in tuition.

"i’m tired of failing but if i don’t fix this i’m throwing in the towel on life transfer student/junior/history department 

i don’t know where to start with any of this other than to say i feel hollow and like a sham.

i know i’m better than all of this but i just don’t know how i got here. i used to be so passionate and energetic. i was a mediocre high school student but really took off in speech & debate. i received good grades at my first college and did decent through the first part of the pandemic but everything changed after i left campus and then left my parent’s house to live on my own.

i lived with sociopaths, meth-heads and dying old people. i’ve slept in a nook in the wall, i’ve slept in the cold, i’ve gone to sleep hungry.

i’ve dealt with both bipolar and adhd throughout my life and while i’m now medicated, and living in a safe environment with some close friends i still can’t fucking make it work.

through most of all of this i’ve been working at a grocery store and i think it’s eating away at my soul. the crazy people, the anti-vax/anti-mask crowd, snooty and condescending upper class white people, the incompetent management and the physically-intensive labor have all been draining on me. 

but i need to pay rent and eat food (financial aid luckily covers my tuition). and those are getting more and more expensive over time it seems.

my transcript since last winter has been abysmal. a couple xs, one ns, and one whole quarter just absolutely failed (last quarter). i’ve been able to discuss a lot of my struggles and get some leeway and really appreciated assistance from advisors and counselors to be able to continue this quarter. but i just can’t seem to find the energy or patience or even mental well-being to study anymore it seems. i just lay in bed a lot of the time or just sleep because i’m so tired and depressed and i feel almost removed from my surroundings and like there’s thick barrier between me and the world right in front of me. i cry, i sleep, i stare into nothingness. it’s so tragic because i’m such a curious and fairly learned person in the subjects i study and have a yearning to go on to more, complete research and finish well but why can’t i seem to actually do any of it? it’s like i keep getting back on the horse only to fall right off.

i resent all of this because i continue to doubt myself and feel like i’m not actually equipped or intelligent enough to be here. 

i feel like an absolute failure and i think i want to just give up. not just school but i mean everything.

i write this with the second exam due for a class tomorrow when i haven’t even done the first or attended a lecture since the first day and it seems like the professor has a strict exam policy and allows no make-ups without medical or university excuse. i’m already on academic probation from my previous quarters.

i’m tired of failing and i know i’m better than this but i don’t know what to do.

i feel like my entire life is on the brink of falling apart and i just might throw myself into the lake. i’ll never reach my goals and all of this feels like a lofty escapade i was never cut out for because i’m lazy and stupid and sad.

"clue tutors/clue tutoring center--prestige over help?? hi everyone. i've never had super negative experiences with the clue tutoring center, but this quarter has been particularly awful and there's a couple of tutors that don't know anything sadly, or they don't want to teach or care to do so. they also have a very negative way of teaching, and they assume that the student should know everything in a problem. for example, my friend asked them a simple molarity problem and one tutor couldn't even solve it, and yes she did apologize, but she claimed to not know the answer or have any notes to help, and she suggested to go to the professor. then why are we visiting the tutoring center? she also shows a lot of attitude and rolls her eyes multiple times, idk why. i went to her and asked her simple questions about naming carbonyls, and she claimed that it was too far back in her knowledge base to teach it?? i have nothing against you not knowing something, but if they don't know the simple facts, then i don't know why they are hired. i also went to one for physics calculus based, and they said that they were tired and didn't feel like teaching. he said that he had too many other students to cater to. ok, i understand that you have a job, i have one too, but can you please teach. also, whenever i ask a question, they say things like ""you seem to have a grasp on it, and i need to get to another student,"" within 12 minutes of the session, with only 2 in the waiting room. no matter how polite or curious about a topic i seem to be this happens. i don't understand the point of having a tutoring center if the students don't seem willing to teach or help out a little bit. or if there's not enough tutors. like if you don't know about the topic, the least you can do is guide the students where to go. guess i better go back to visiting the tas in long lines or watching youtube. it's so hard to get help at this university.

"re: the recent influx of “can you hold x class for me?” posts you can only sign up for, at max, 19 credits until the first day of the quarter. unless you want one, singular 4-credit or less class, no one can hold it for you (assuming they’re seeking 15 credits; if they’re seeking 12, hey, you might have a shot). however, you’d be better off just asking a close friend than looking here. additionally, you’re not always going to get the class you want - but that doesn’t mean you won’t get the ones you *need* on time. when you’re a senior you can apply for graduation up to three quarters  prior to your commencement date which gives you first priority. priority rocks - i’ve always gotten the classes i wanted. if you’re very dead set on a class, sign up for notify uw. if you’re fast enough, you’re likely to get it, even if you have to try multiple times and/or wait until the first week begins. plus, some of the classes that you guys have been asking for are major-only up until a certain date or indefinitely. if you aren’t in the major, your chances are mid-to-low of ever getting into it. if you’re in the major, you’ll get it eventually.

"looking for advice from people who have taken biol 418 or phys 323! choosing between them; how were they? hi my peeps in upper div bio and/or physics!! 

i am a junior currently registered for biol 418 (biological rhythms with de la iglesia), which sounds really interesting, but i really fell in love with phys 321/322 (electromag 1/2) and would really like to take phys 323 next quarter, which conflicts with biol 418. i have the option to drop biol 418 and take phys 323, and i'm really on the fence about if i should do it.

it makes more sense to take phys 323 right after 321/322, but i'm worried 418 won't be offered/i won't be able to get into it next spring. upper div phys registration is comparatively noncompetitive, so getting into 323 next spring is not an issue, but i'm worried i'll have forgotten too much content to learn as much. 

**for those who took biol 418:**

* how exciting was it overall as a class? like was it genuinely very interesting or did it just feel like a graduation requirement?
* was it one of those classes (or profs) that really stuck with you relative to other classes in the major (i would say 355 with buchwitz was like that)? 

**for those who took phys 323:**

* how much was your knowledge of 321/322 needed to take it? if you took 323 a year after 322, was it a significant struggle to relearn everything or was it not exclusively reliant on knowledge from 321/322? 
* do you think i could get enough out of it by just auditing, or was doing the homework crucial to appreciating the content?

i am a senior in washington state, and i have applied to uw.

i was about a 3.8 student pre-covid, but then i tanked to a 3.3 after covid. it’s my senior year in high school, so it’s practically impossible to raise my gpa. my sat is nowhere near where i want it to be since my school literally didn’t prep any of the students. when i applied to uw, my grade 11 marks were oh-so poor, and i can’t help but regret ever succumbing to my anxieties and depression. mental health issues are nothing new to me and they’ve never interfered with my grades, but covid really tested me. 

now, i feel like my grades have replaced my face when it comes to college applications because it seems to be grades first, and then me. there are a handful of colleges who would reach out and give me a chance of redemption when it comes to grades, but unfortunately those chances are unlikely. 

is it possible to still make a good candidate for uw, or just any college in general?

regardless of whether you get in or not, realize that a college decision does not define you in any way. you are just as smart and capable regardless of whether or not you get accepted to your dream school. 

i was in your position two years ago and i understand how stressful this time can be with the anticipation of whether or not you’ll get in mixed with potential disappointment and excitement too. it’s so many emotions at once that it can be overwhelming sometimes. take time to yourself so that you take care of your mental health. also make sure you celebrate your wins too even if you’re disappointed by some of the decisions you get. after all, making it this far is a pretty big deal and you deserve to feel proud of yourself for all of the hard work you put in.

please don’t let a less than ideal decision take away from your self worth or peace of mind. you’ll end up where you’re meant to be and you’ll get a great education regardless of where you end up going. honestly, beating yourself up about a decision just isn’t worth the time and emotional turmoil. trust me, i’m speaking from experience.

so yeah, all in all just relax this upcoming month or so and trust that things will work out one way or another in end :)",advice

"guide for gcse and a-level students so with admissions rolling out this month, i thought i'd make an info dump post on my experience coming in with gcses and a-levels. unfortunately, this subreddit and uw's website lack relatable information, so here's what i have to share.

i applied to the college of engineering with 8 gcses and 4 a-levels: biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics.

from what i understand, you can technically apply to the uw with just gcses, but you'll somehow need to prove your *""high school""* education level. for my case, that was 6th form. i'm not sure how that works, but you can always [ask the uw admissions office.](https://admit.washington.edu/contact/have-a-question)

and while you are at it, email department faculty you find exciting and build connections to learn more!

***university level credit:***

**gcses:**

there is no credit for gcses.

**a-levels:**

you can receive up to a maximum of 45 credits with 3 a levels. (for reference, that's about one years' worth of credits at a 4-year quarter system college (180 total to graduate)).

this means when i entered with 4 a-levels, i should have received 60 credits, but uw has a maximum in place, and i have no idea why. therefore, my transcript technically shows 60 credits, but a cap of 45 is applied.

***what's the benefit?***

well, i got credit for all my intro chem weed outs (142, 152, and 162).

(weed outs are classes where the median class grade is 2.7-2.9).

as for biol, phys, and math, those credits are useless as an engrud student. instead, they show up as 1xx and some other course numbers on my transcript, irrelevant to my intended major.

you can find the details for which classes you can receive credit for with [a-levels on uw's a-level policy page.](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/exams-for-credit/a-as-level/)

the standout benefit is having [**sophomore class standing** since you enter with 45 credits](https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-priorsp22). having a higher priority and registering for classes 2-3 days ahead of freshmen makes registration a little calmer. i've been able to get all my courses at reasonable times.

phys 121 was the only class i couldn't get for spring 2022, but i still had an extra two days to wake up at 6 am and get a decent class schedule together.

***how to submit my a-level certificates?***

[read this page](https://www.washington.edu/newhuskies/must-do/sending-final-transcripts/). i was able to get my school to email my certificates.

&#x200b;

***can you graduate early?***

depends, in my case, i've basically freed up 15 credits worth of classes that are required for my major, with some micromanagement and overloading (taking 18 credits per quarter instead of 15), i could graduate early, but my intended major works on a cohort system and you can't exactly graduate early.   
however, adding in a minor or taking additional cs courses when you are not in the major are freedoms i can take thanks to comming in with credits. and if i were to study a major where you can set your own classes to graduate, i could probably wrap up undergrad in <3 years.   


***are a-levels useful at uw?***

...yes? i guess.

i say that since i've only been at the uw for two quarters as of now, and i'm making my way through the engrud placement requirement classes.

a-level maths has saved my ass for the intro calc series; math 124 and 125, and probably also for 126 next quarter. about two years ago, a-level maths counted for credit for the intro calc series, but by the 2021-22 academic year, they removed math 124 and 125 and replaced it with 1xx.

that meant i had another weed-out series to get through. having completed math 124 and almost 125. i can confidently say if you've been decent at a-level maths, the intro calc series shouldn't be too rough. the a-level syllabus covers about 70-80% of the content in intro calc, and the missing parts are pretty easy to pick up that a-level kinda glossed over. but i am confident that if you've taken a-level math and received an a or a\*, you should be able to at least get a 3.5 for your intro calc classes. a 4.0 is ideally in your grasp as well. but you do need to work for it. grind those past papers.

i will assume a similar correlation for the intro phys and biol series. the level workload does set you up for success for your first year of college at uw.

that's all i have in mind at the moment. i plan on continuously editing this post going forward to include improved/relevant information. so if this post has missing information, i'll try my best and fill it in.

i remember searching through many discords and this subreddit to find information when choosing uw. i hope this post is helpful :)",discussion

>  
>i came to the uw intending to study cs, but after two rejections i  decided to cut my losses and major in physics (an open major at the  time). i wasn't sure how much my major would hold me back, but i tried  to get as much experience as possible to make up for it. by the time i  reached my senior year, i had two internships at a no-name startup, an  on-campus webdev job, and a data science-related research assistant  position in a on-campus lab. this new grad cycle, i had \~20% callback  rate on applications. i received offers from blue origin, credit karma,  amazon and meta, and i had final interviews with several other companies  (google, stripe, akuna capital, robinhood, walmart).  
>  
>to get an offer, you need to  
>  
>1. get the interview  
>  
>2. pass the interview  
>  
>getting interviews involves a lot of luck, but there's a lot of things  you can do to increase your chances. before you have any paid dev  experience at all, get as many relevant ecs and projects on your resume  as possible. research assistant positions, ta positions, club leadership  positions, involvement in project clubs, etc will help your callback  rate when applying for your first internship. learn full stack  development and build a few simple apps/sites/games from scratch. use  best practices, document them well, host them on github pages or heroku  and put them on your resume. try to get the highest gpa you can, as many  companies still filter by this, but once you have some experience most  companies don't care about it.  
>  
>next, get as much paid development experience as you can (even a minimum  wage job at a no-name startup will significantly increase your callback  rate). competitive companies will expect new grads to have at least 1-2  internships by the time they graduate. polish your resume, apply early,  and get referrals (clubs, blind, and cs discord channels are great  sources for these). if a company you'd like to work at doesn't respond  to your online app, try cold emailing a recruiter (this is how i got a  meta interview). you'll probably need to apply to 100-200+ places to get  your first internship, but having even one internship will make future  app cycles significantly easier. having internship/projects/ecs on your  resume is especially important if you're not a cse/info major, since  they can't assume that you know anything based on your major alone.  
>  
>once you've got an interview, the only thing that matters is how well  you perform. your performance is determined by leetcode prep,  communication skills, behavioral answers, and possibly system design.  for the technical skills you need, take cse 373 (data structures and  algorithms for non-majors). cse 143/cse 373 cover most of what you need  to know for technical interviews. after taking (or self-studying) these  classes, learn the common patterns in interview questions by reviewing  grokking the coding interview. you don't need to buy the course, as much  of the material can be found for free on blogs and other sites. next,  work through the blind 75 list of leetcode questions. this covers most  of the types of questions you'll be asked in an interview, and being  able to solve these questions is enough for 90% of interviews out there.  when you have an interview coming up, complete the most common tagged  qs for that company on leetcode. some companies (like google) change up  their qs a lot so this isn't that helpful when interviewing with them,  but other companies (like amazon and meta) will often ask questions  copied directly from their lc tagged list. if you have an interview with  a company that asks system design questions, review grokking the system  design interview beforehand. most importantly, practice your  communication skills in mock interviews (you should pretty much always  be talking as you're coding) and prep good behavioral stories. companies  don't just want leetcode monkeys, they want people have have good soft  skills and can work on a team.  
>  
>anyway, that's my brief guide to getting a swe job with an unrelated  degree. hopefully it helps some of you who are interested in tech but  aren't in cse/info. not being a cs major honestly doesn't change much  about the process, it's just more difficult to get your first internship  and you'll have to self-study a bit more.

"uw “pre-majors” and freshman admissions explained i was hella confused about the university of washington major stuff after being admitted yesterday and so i did some research that i will now share in hopes of clearing up any confusion 

**uw has three types of majors: open majors, minimum, and capacity-constrained**

open majors are majors with no requirements that students can switch into at any time. minimum majors are majors that have requirements (required classes and grades) that students must take in order to be admitted to said major. capacity-constrained majors are ones that have limited capacity and also have requirements to get into. 

**now keeping that in mind, freshman applicants can be admitted in three ways.**

**pre-major, direct to major, or direct to college**

what confused me the most was getting pre-major and thinking i didn’t get accepted into my major, when this was not the case

**there are only 19 majors that students can be directly admitted into that require direct admission to be in the major:** architecture, biochemistry, business administration, chemistry, computer science, computer engineering, composition (music), construction management, guitar (music), informatics, jazz studies, music, music education, neuroscience, orchestral instruments (music), organ (music), piano (music), strings (music), and voice (music)

**if you applied to one of the above majors and were admitted into a “pre-major” (such as pre-art, pre-sciences, etc) it means you did not get admission into your major**

**if you got into your direct admit major mentioned above it means you are guaranteed a degree from said major**

all majors with this form of direct admission are also capacity-constrained, so if you happen to have applied for computer science and are admitted into pre-sciences uw is basically saying “sorry you weren’t competitive enough for said major, please pick another major because you have a very small chance of getting into computer science”  

it is kind of a big bummer for those that applied to capacity-constrained majors because it essentially makes it very difficult for them to major in what they want 

**edit: however if you are not directly admitted to some of these majors you can still try!! it is just harder**

**”you can come to uw and then apply to architecture, bio chem, neuro, informatics, etc. they do have da but it is not the only way to get in”**

**it can just be insanely difficult for majors like cs and comp engineering**

**there are some direct-admission majors that are open majors, which mean if you get into uw you are automatically put into your major and also means that any student is technically guaranteed a degree from said major without meeting requirements**, these include: american ethnic studies, anthropology, art history, asian studies, atmospheric sciences, canadian studies, classical studies, comparative religion, danish, environmental studies, european studies, finnish, french, gender studies, geography, greek, italian, jewish studies, latin, marine biology, norwegian, etc…

**these majors are open majors, which means if you apply to uw under one of these majors and are admitted you automatically get in your major**

it also means that anyone at any time can switch into them with relative ease 

next up is pre-major. **the majority of students are admitted into pre-majors simply because their major doesn’t have direct-admission (usually because they are majors with requirements that are either minimum or capacity-constrained)**

to gain admission into the pre-major majors students need to satisfy prerequisites and meet admission requirements 

your likelihood then of getting your major is based on if it is minimum, or capacity-constrained, but even if it is capacity-constrained no one else has yet to be admitted in your year and you will all compete for admission when you declare your major 

for me i applied for physics (a capacity-constrained but non direct-admit major) so i was admitted into pre-sciences and will have to (like anyone else who applied and “got in” for physics compete with students to get my physics major later on) 

there are: pre-social science, pre-sciences, pre-architecture, pre-humanities, and pre-art 

**if you applied for a minimum or capacity-constrained major that does not have direct admission and isn’t engineering and got a “pre-major”**

**congrats!!**

**you were essentially admitted into what you wanted to be and just have to compete later on when you declare**

the last option is direct to college, which is only applicable for engineering.

if you applied for engineering and get into engineering you get “engineering undeclared,” and pick the engineering later

if you applied to engineering and do not get into engineering, you will then get a pre-major, which is similar to not getting direct admission into a capacity constrained major 

sorry this is so long but hopefully it helps make this weird admissions choice easier

why would uw ever do this

"clarification on engineering admissions i’m seeing folks asking about engrud vs pre-sciences, figured it could help to repost what i commented under another post:

engineering undeclared students are guaranteed *an* engineering major (provided you have a passing gpa and complete intro sciences), but are not guaranteed their top choice. if you’re aiming for hcde, bioe,, or meche, at some point you should consider backup choices. 

starting at the end of freshman year, there’s a competitive placement process where you submit a ranked list of engineering majors that you’ve satisfied the prereqs for. there are two main placement rounds, plus an early and a late round for special circumstances. *if during any round you receive placement, that becomes your major. switching engineering majors after placement is the same as applying at a non-engrud.*

also, for people looking at engineering degrees but didn’t get engrud:
some of the engineering majors always run a surplus of placements versus top choices. for those majors, if you can demonstrate interest academically and in your application, you still have a good shot at getting in from pre-sciences. for example, i’ve met a couple people who got into cive from pre-science. unfortunately, your chances at the competitive majors like hcde, bioe, and meche are still pretty low, however.",admissions

i'm currently a junior who resides in alabama and is looking at out-of-state tuition for uw. i have a lot of family back in seattle and i've always dreamt of going to the seattle campus for college, but it's looking very....unaffordable at this point. i'm one of the strongest performers at my school (i'll attach my academics below if that would be helpful) and a ton of community service hours from being an eagle scout and ib. i also have a job at a restaurant that i've held for a year now (i know a lot of colleges love to see students with a job plus taking the hardest classes available), as well as taking business classes for 3 years of high school and ib business & management next year (important since i plan to enter with the intent of going to the foster school of business). i also plan on getting an internship at an investment banking firm over this upcoming summer.

for my college essay, i'd like to talk about how my adversities of growing up in an extremely evangelical and conservative state were enormous as a gay, atheist, and progressive teen (especially relating to scouting and the bullying and hazing i endured with that because of my sexuality), and how i turned these struggles into a way to create a strong work ethic. i'm hoping that would help them open their wallet up a little bit to me, but i genuinely have no idea.

"it's that time: the annual 'go to community college (seriously)' plea the post title is tongue-in-cheek, but hear me out. there's a lot of sincerity in people telling you to do this.

it's admissions season, and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're one of thousands of freshmen who didn't make the cut for admissions this year. and that sucks. there's no diminishing it, especially if you're like many uw students who were a part of some honors or ap program that was priming you for the straight to college pipeline, and telling you that anything less was abject failure.

(or maybe you just have asian parents.)

i'm here to tell you why community college is a perfectly valid path that'll still bring you to the uw, how to make it work for you, and if i'm doing a good job, you might come to find it was the smarter decision anyway. this is coming from someone who applied to uw in his senior year of high school and, having finished that last semester with a 1.7 gpa, predictably did not get in. it was pretty devastating: high school sucked, and as a little baby gay, i couldn't see myself being happy anywhere but seattle. i applied again a decade later (you don't need to wait this long) having job experience, an aa earned with highest honors, and a much clearer direction of where i wanted to take my life - and these have been among the best years of my life because of it. so not only am i writing this to the freshmen who were hyped and pumped up to get here, but i'm also writing to people who also have started to wonder if college was in reach for them *at all*: because of their abilities, because of a garbage high school experience, because their family is poor, etc. **you can make it happen.**

i work with other cc transfer students *a lot*. it's not all sunshine and daisies, but there are minimal regrets - and a number of commonly-cited reasons as to why community college was the best decision for them:

**1)** **$$$**

the big one everyone will talk about is money, and for good reason: **a single 5-credit course at uw costs about as much as a full-time quarter at a wa state community college.** on the whole, you're going to spend about a third as much on your first two years compared to someone who went straight to uw. unless your family is already wealthy, this is a pretty attractive point to anyone - and it's half the reason why, as a first-gen student, grad school is even a future possibility for me. 

bonus for oos (non-international) students: cc tuition isn't that much more expensive for you compared to the baseline (~$130/cred vs. $116/cred), while uw would have you paying 3-4x as much - to the point that many will tell you to just not come here oos unless you're mega-wealthy. for oos students, this can be a great opportunity to establish yourself & work towards residency, but that is a *whole ass process* you'll want to talk to the professionals about.

further: community colleges usually have foundations that collect and hand out scholarships like candy to students with big aspirations, while here the odds can be so long you might have a better chance fighting the other applicants to the death in the gladiator pit under condon hall.

**2)** **better academics**

big prerequisite classes for more competitive majors - math, bio, chem, the works - are colloquially called 'weedouts', with pretty brutal exams and grading curves. a quick search on this sub will show you what the experience is like. many of these can be taken at a cc and transferred in - and you'll probably have a more accessible professor, classroom aides, and a class size about a tenth of what you'd find here. even current uw students will often dip a cc course during the summer just to avoid how utterly miserable they can be here.

beyond skipping weedouts, wa state ccs are among the best in the country. many cc professors very much teach foremost out of a passion for helping their students.  for the first time in my life, i didn't hate math, and i was able to ace statistics - which was unthinkable for me at the time (and uw straight up taught me to hate it again anyways lmaoo). i took biology with a professor who i later learned had began at that same community college, went to uw for undergrad microbio with awards for research excellence, and went on to get his phd. he played chill hollow knight ambience during our exam days. honestly, i'll probably remember more of my cc profs than my uw ones by the time i'm in my career field.

**3)** **easier accessibility**

this is a broad one, but: unless you're taking out loans or coasting on your parent's dime in the dorms, making an education happen at uw is *hard*. seattle has a high cost of living and many students have to live outside and commute 1-2h every day. prior to the pandemic, the university basically went out of its way to *not* offer online courses, while many ccs have them as a staple. the time and money you save just by not having to struggle to *be* here are resources you can put into yourself, your extracurriculars, and planning out your transfer to make the most of your time here.

**4)** **lots of involvement opportunities**

this is true at uw, too, but it's just more accessible here. become a student leader, go work with student life, get hired as a tutor, join a robotics club. tied in with the accessibility bit above, you'll have more room on your plate to volunteer or intern somewhere. cc is no different from uw in this regard, though: to make these things happen, you have to go search for them. people will tell you that the degree you get here matters a lot less than the connections you made or the opportunities you embraced, and imo that same message rings true for your community college experience.

**5)** **life perspective**

this one is ambiguous, but bear with me. my very first community college class was english 101. i sat a table with an international student from japan, a 40-year-old military veteran who was working on getting a degree in machining, and a woman in her late 20s who i later learned had been on the streets for about a year before transitional housing became available for her. by the time the quarter started, she'd been off the streets for just a month. in the span of her two years there, she'd go on to study it and get an internship with t mobile, who later hired her for about $70k starting.

when you sit in a stuffy lecture hall at uw with a bunch of college-bound kids from career college families, you rarely get these kind of stories. you don't get the same perspective on how 'success' can mean different things to different people, how it's equally as valid, and the sacrifices some people have to make in order to make their education happen. where's uw on the us news college rankings? what's your sat score? did you apply to ivies? at that table, *nobody fucking cared*. it's hard to describe how valuable that lesson is: the way it changes how you see and interact with other people, how it reframes your perspective on yourself and your education, and what it all means to you. you've probably spent 4 years on a rat-race gifted high schooler track; step off it, just for a little while.

this experience translates to your time at uw in a way that professors notice, too. professors fucking love transfer students. they've got life experience, tend to be less full of anxiety and bullshit, and are often among the best participators in their classrooms. student & campus jobs will love you, too. there's transfer shock, sure, but when you get here, a lot of transfers feel pretty ahead of the pack, and if they planned their transfer well they get to drop right into the heart of their major's core classes.

----

getting through your two years at cc is one thing, but if you can do that, honestly the path forward is simple:

1. use your time at cc to explore majors and figure out what you want to do.
2. take some time to think about how your desired career path impacts the world, or a problem or disadvantaged communities in it. there's a world beyond academia: engage with it.
3. get involved, somewhere. bonus points if it's tied into the above. think about how that's relevant to your desired career path.
4. go to class. get those grades.
5. write a bomb-ass essay that ties all the above together, and show them how dumb they'd have to be to *not* take you.

if you have your heart set here, for whatever reason, and didn't make it in: go to community college. seriously. i hope the ramblings of a former lost teen help at least one person out there also feeling like a lost teen today.",admissions

"detailed explanation of uw grading system **first of all, congratulations on your acceptance to uw seattle! we're happy for you to become a new husky!** now i will give some insights on how uw grading works, because uw has a totally different system from other universities.

i will introduce the following commonly used grading schemes:

1. point-based grading (pbg)
2. rank-based grading (rbg)
3. mastery-based grading (mbg)
4. contract-based grading (cbg)

&#x200b;

# 1.  point-based grading (pbg)

* this grading method is widely used for all courses **except** for cse 14x, cse 373, engl 1x1, engl 182, and introductory-level stem weedout classes. your grade is **not curved**, which you will have a grading scale with total possible points. by the end of the quarter, the percentage grade resulted from the quotient of points earned dividing total possible points automatically translates to a corresponding numeric grade.

*example*:

|percentage (%)|grade|percentage (%)|grade|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|95 - 100|4.0\*|62 - 63|0.8|
|94|3.9|60 - 61|0.7|
|93|3.8|0 - 59|0.0|

depends on your instructor, if you have an overall grade of 94.9%, the professor who rounds up all grades will give you a 4.0. otherwise, you will get a 3.9.

* **pros**: easy to navigate and manage your grade, straightforward. **you get what you earned**.
* **cons**: fixed grading scale, low scores affect your grade. the threshold for 4.0 can range from 93% to 99%.

&#x200b;

# 2. rank-based grading (rbg)

* commonly known as **grading-on-a-curve, which your grade is highly dependent on the class average and median**. **rbg is widely used in introductory-level stem weedout** classes and its purpose is to limit number of students earning grades above 3.5 to keep capacity-constrained majors remain academically competitive. there's no clear cutoff for certain grade, but your professor would say by achieving ""..."" you will guarantee a 2.0. **by the end of the quarter, the instructor will decide the course median based on the class performance and set up the cutoffs for 4.0, 2.0, and 0.7. then use interpolation to decide the other grades**.
* the introductory calculus sequence **(math 124-125-126)** curves to **2.7-3.1** median.
* the general chemistry sequence **(chem 142-152-162)** curves to **2.4-2.8** median.
* the calculus-based physics sequence **(phys 121-122-123)** curves to **2.9-3.0** median.
* the introductory biology sequence **(biol 180-200-220) limits grade of 4.0 assigned less than 7%**. course median usually swing between **2.7 and 3.2**.

*example*:

|percentage (%)|grade|percentage (%)|grade|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|97|4.0\*|72|2.5|
|91|3.5|66|2.0|
|82|3.0|50|0.7|

\*depends on the exam statistics, if the exam is hard enough that the course median before the curve is outside of the official range, then the professor will adjust the cutoff for 4.0 and/or 2.0. the minimum for a 4.0 can range from 89% to 98%.

* pros: bad exams aren't automatically fail you and the cutoff for 2.0 is usually more lenient.
* cons: extremely overwhelming and unreasonable to treat your classmates as rivalry.

&#x200b;

# 3. mastery-based grading (mbg)

* the mastery-based grading is newly proposed by cse professor kevin lin and used in cse 142, cse 143, cse 163, and cse 373 starting the 2020-2021 academic year. instead of curving the grade to a median of 2.7-3.0, the **mbg encourages students learning from their mistakes**. **you have to meet the minimum requirements for a specific grade range**.

*example*: [cse 142 syllabus (22wi)](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/22wi/syllabus.html#grading)

* pros: make the class less stressful and motivational to learn.
* cons: grade can be ambiguous at times. **mbg is not used for stuart reges' cse classes**.

&#x200b;

# 4. contract-based grading (cbg)

* the contract-based grading is used **only in the english composition courses** at uw, which at the first day of the class, you will sign a grading contract that to get a certain grade. the contract states what requirements are necessary for a specific grade (4.0, 3.5, 3.0, and etc.) once you met all the requirements, you automatically get the grade.

*example*: [engl 1x1 grading contract](https://english.washington.edu/sites/english/files/documents/ewp/teaching_resources/emily_george_grading_contracts.pdf)

* pros: straightforward, easy to manage, and no ambiguity.
* cons: you need to work for the grade you selected.

other notes: emailing new docs, asking for added consideration yourself, repetitive requests, will not in general help your application during the final reviews. they just don't have the bandwidth or right to stop and say your app is special and gets added treatment past the deadline. if anything you might be considered an annoyance or possible problem if admitted in severe cases. keep calm, they accept everyone that they can and you're likely months past the original app deadline now. there's also not the time to say what was wrong or how to improve your application and thousands of others. if you lost, review what you sent, what was in the university system for completeness, and follow the numerous sources online. plan to try again!",admissions

**optional recall/spaced repetition database thingy:**

for this, clear all the confidence levels by switching to the all cards view > highlighting everything > edit properties > removing the confidence level tag > switch back to the test today view. after, once you start quizzing yourself, set the confidence level to how confident you are with 1 being the least confident and 5 being the most. cards in the test today view will automatically pop up on the day that you should be quizzing yourself (the lower confident cards will be tested more often than the more confident cards). 

you can also tag cards with core, moderate, advanced, and other things. one tip i have is to tag cards you think are way too easy with archived. this will make it so you will never be tested on the card again. this does not delete the card. it just is filtered out by the test today view.

"if you take math 124 take naehrig such a wonderful person and professor. is excited to teach and excited about math, puts effort into lectures, designs the course in a way that actually helps you learn. the pre lecture videos she provides and in class sheets you do during the lecture actually make sure you are keeping on track with what the class is doing. she is one of the most accommodating professors i have ever had, and is more accommodating than most of my community college professors (excluding the one who's entire 5 credit history class was a 5 pt quiz about an unsourced word document but i digress) and will work with you to get you to do as well as you can. she seems to be a professor who wants you to pass, which is not what i expected for math 124. i am doing pretty bad this quarter ngl, but i feel like i learned way more than in 120, and unlike in 120, even though i find it very difficult, i came out of this class genuinely liking calc at a conceptual level.

"questions about residence halls & campus travel so i’m going to be a freshmen this fall (:d) and i was wondering if you would be willing to answer some questions for me about the campus, residence halls, and disability accommodations. i’ve already looked through uw’s website, though i might have missed something (there’s *so many* pages). if this is something that i should call or email someone about instead of taking up your guy’s time that would be helpful information too! 

thank you for your time :)

for those who are living on campus: how did you choose which residence hall to apply to/live in? i’ve heard that mcmahon and hagget don’t have free wifi which… doesn’t sound great. but i don’t know where to go from here. did you guys choose based on its distance from something? is so, what was it that you wanted to be close to? is there something that you did not want to live close to? did you choose due to the living learning communities? is there a residence hall (or type of room) that’s notorious for being challenging to live in? are some louder or quieter on average? or are they all similar enough that it’s not really a important choice? 

this is a sort of specific question but are there any residence halls that (usually) have a more reliable elevator than others? because of some medical problems i can’t walk very long (like 5-10 minutes max) and stairs are worse. 

on that line of thought, are there any residence halls that it’s easier to get disability accommodations in? i don’t think i phrased that right but essentially i meant is it easier in the more modern halls to do things like have a visual fire alarm or is the wiring not a issue despite when the hall was made? 

going back to traveling, how far do you think you have to walk in one day? what’s the most common transport (scooter, bike, etc) option you see? do you think the campus is wheelchair accessible? i know their website says so but i also wanted to ask people what it’s like to confirm lol. 

thanks for any responses :) i didn’t really know where to go and i appreciate any help you can give me! sorry for all the questions!!!





this is more personal and probably unnecessary but i’d really appreciate some help if you’re willing! i briefly mentioned it earlier but i *can* walk, just not for long or far. this is less related to housing but i still want to ask. since the campus is so big i don’t think i’ll be able to walk as much as i need to regularly. a bike *may* work since i’m sitting down but i’m not sure. and a scooter or skateboard won’t help since standing can be really painful as well. if i used a wheelchair (possibly electric because of the hills? idk) to get across campus, would it give a bad impression of me if people also saw me walking short distances? my highschool campus is small enough that i can (mostly) get by so this will be the first time that i’ve had to consider using a wheelchair for more than a day and it’s a bit nerve wracking.",advice

y’all. the biology eec major is bullshit. there are only a handful of actually relevant classes, you have to take ochem and physics, and what few relevant classes there actually are are focused on the ecology of microbiology. the bio department only cares about the medical field and it shows. i love science and math but this has been a huge fucking waste of credit hours.

"i have a lot of questionssss [cs/ce freshman reject looking to transfer as cc student] i recently got waitlisted as a freshman applicant to uw (probably because i had cs and ce in my top 2 preferred majors). i tried appealing but that got denied as well so i’m looking to transfer from the cc i’m
 attending for running start (cascadia college). in combination with credits transferred from dual-enrollment evcc classes, i have 91 credits and a 3.969 gpa. however, i expect that the evcc credits won’t transfer since they were low-level classes (intro to physics, english, and some european history credits) so i plan on taking a few more classes before transferring.  i had a few questions though. 

1. how long do i have to wait before i can apply as a transfer? i’ve heard different answers from the people i’ve asked. an advisor said 2 semesters after i graduate while some other people (and the uw website) say i can transfer any time after summer quarter. is it different for people who applied as freshman? do we have to wait a bit longer? 

2.  what extracurriculars do you guys recommend me doing? right now i am working on creating a digital replica of my house using cad software. by the time i apply i plan on making some 3d worlds that anyone can visit in vrchat (its a personal hobby of mine). i am also a council member at the engineering club at my school. i also plan on making some vr haptic gloves this summer to mess around with. should i work on trying to get some more ecs? the club president is leaving soon so i might be able to take that spot or take vp. 

3. to people who have successfully transferred into cs/engineering, what was your gpa , what college did you go to, and how were your extracurriculars? i’ve heard that bellevue college tends to get more students into uw but i’m a bit late in my degree to transfer. still could if it gives enough of an advantage.

"graduate housing recommendations graduate housing options

hey huskies 👋 
i just got accepted into a graduate program at uw starting autumn 2022 and i’m trying to navigate the housing options available.

i have a few questions and i’d appreciate some feedback from people who’ve lived on/off campus.

1. what’s the best dorm given a trade off between equipment, price, distance to campus and social life? 
i read a few posts that mention the newer options are better. i couldn’t find anything on how the social life within specific dorms is so i’m quite clueless there. i’m (relatively??) young so i don’t mind being in a dorm that’s not exclusively for grad students and might be loud/busy.

2. is it a better option to live off campus in the surrounding areas? 
i can see multiple listings around the campus which seem very nice to live in.

3. will i end up getting a cheaper deal living and eating on campus? 
i understand that really comes down to lifestyle choices and how much i’m willing to cook but i’m interested in hearing personal experiences 

4. what’s the typical social life for graduate students? 
are you mostly just hanging out with people from your cohort or is it a mix of undergrad/other grad students?

5. tell me about your favourite bars/pubs in/around the campus! 


any other advice regarding graduate student life is appreciated. i’ll buy a round or two of beers for anyone who’s available to connect over dm.

1. is it difficult to get directly into a bio major, especially considering there is no direct admit? what is the app process like?
2. how brutal are the class curves, and how has your own experience been with staying ahead of the average? how many hours a day do you typically study, and do you feel like it's feasible?
3. what is the process of gaining research / shadowing around seattle like? i've heard of opportunities at fred hutch
4. ultimately what would you choose if you were given these options for undergrad:

(1) **uw seattle** — admitted pre-sciences, you probably know more about it than i do. love the location and social fit

(2) **santa clara university** — admitted for biology, grade inflation, but no r1 research status or much name recognition. would go there freshman year while trying to transfer

(3) **baylor university** — admitted for neuroscience, $56,000 merit scholarship to my top choice program in the honors college, grade inflation. they recently gained r1 research status, but it's an absolutely terrible social/cultural fit and i wouldn't like the location

"questions - college decisions (update)  

hello everyone,

i hope you are doing well! i think i posted this question on this discussion before, but i want to receive people’s thoughts as certain things have changed monetarily. so currently as a high school senior, i have narrowed my choices down to uc berkeley eecs (direct admit) and the university of washington’s cs program as a direct admit (my in-state school).

previously, everyone advised me to choose uw due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently i learned that i was accepted for the regents and chancellor’s scholarship at berkeley. this scholarship now makes uw and berkeley cost the exact same for me. however, i am still having trouble deciding which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. the only reason i am considering staying in-state with uw is that as a dual enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, i will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with uw cs. at berkeley, i understand that eecs is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that i may have to attend university for 4 years instead. 

i know some may think this is a clear-cut choice, but i was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. for example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (i have heard from many that experience matters more than education)? what are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? overall, if cost isn't a factor, what would make you choose one over the other?

i am the first in my family to go to college, so these are things that have been stressful and any help would be appreciated!",advice

"q - uw cs internships (vs. uw bothell) hello everyone,

i had a quick question involving the internship opportunities for cs students studying at the paul g. allen school at uw seattle. is it often true that internships are still extremely difficult to come by even as an allen school student? i have friends at the school that mention that the career fairs aren’t really that fruitful and that one must apply to 400+ internships to barely get an interview. i was wondering if you all could expand on this(ex. sharing tips and advice for what helped you) and maybe share your experiences for this, as i know for a cs major getting an internship is a major step toward getting a full-time job later on. 

additionally, is it true that when applying for internships, all uw campuses appear the same on an application and have access to the same career fairs? i ask because i had read somewhere else that when applying on linkedin or other sites, uw bothell and uw seattle just appear as uw, even though both programs are significantly different in regards to name and prestige (no disrespect to uwb).

i applied for cs and engineering and didn't get into either (i didn't expect to at all, i understand how competitive it is). i know it's virtually impossible to transfer in later on and i'm not going on a wild goose chase for that so i looked into other options. the uw offered some cs alternatives i could consider, and the main ones i would like to go into are acms (data science & statistics), applied math, informatics, or statistics. 

now, i assumed that since these were offered as alternatives in the colleges of arts & sciences it would be relatively easy to get into one of these, even thought they were capacity constrained. i looked into it, and the recent acceptance rates for all of these hovered around 30% (or lower)! i guess my question is, how do i know what prerequisites to complete if i only have a small chance of getting into any of these majors? i know i'm fearing the worst, but i'm so afraid of completing the necessary pre-recs for these programs and getting denied from all of them - what do i do then? do i have to redo all my pre-recs so i can go in a different direction? i feel like i'm overthinking this or looking too much into it, any answers to my questions are much appreciated :') sorry for the long frantic post",advice

"uw major system and registration master guide as we entering the second half of the spring quarter, lots of you may already committed to uw. **first of all, congratulations! i am very proud of you getting accepted by uw!** now i am going to give more insights on how the major system and registration at uw work. 

&#x200b;

# 1. major system

**1.1 types of majors** [all majors](http://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) at uw can be categorized into five levels:

**level 1 (open)**: you can declare the major ***anytime*** as long as the cumulative gpa is above 2.0.

* **level 2 (minimum requirements)**: you need to complete the required prerequisites with an overall gpa of 2.50 and higher, and the cumulative gpa is also 2.00 or higher.
* **level 3 (less selective)**: the least competitive type of capacity-constrained majors. in addition to the requirement on prerequisites, you have to complete additional application or essay prompts. ***majors at this level usually have an acceptance rate above 50%***.
* **level 4 (moderately selective)**: most of the stem majors at uw fall in this level, which ***the acceptance rate is less than 50% but above 20%***. very similar to level 3 majors, but you need to earn ***stellar grades (above 3.7)*** to guarantee the acceptance.
* **level 5 (most selective)**: for any majors with ***an acceptance rate under 20%, unless you have an extraordinary gpa (3.9+) with unique ps and cv, i would not suggest you wasting quarters to apply***. if you still wish to pursue similar paths, please try to get the prerequisites done so you can apply for level 3 or level 4 majors. 

&#x200b;

**1.2 some of the commonly applied or heard majors:**

* biology - level 3
* computer science/engineering - level 5
* applied mathematics - level 5
* engineering - level 3 or 4 (depends on your path)
* psychology - level 3 or 4 (vary by quarter)
* education (eco) - level 3 (4 if you're a sophomore)
* statistics - level 4
* mathematics - level 4
* english - level 2
* acms - level 5
* political science - level 2
* informatics - level 4 (vary by quarter)
* economics - level 3 or 4 (vary by quarter)
* any foster - level 4

&#x200b;

**1.3 tips on declaring majors:**

* if you're ***not*** dtm (direct-to-major) or dtc (direct-to-college) but ***dreaming for level 4 or 5 majors***, please have at least one level 1 or 2 major planned. undergraduate is your best time to explore different academic interests.
* if you come to uw with ***more than*** ***30 transfer credits*** (2 quarters equivalency), you're expected to declare a major ***by the winter quarter of your second year***. otherwise, a registration hold will be placed on your account until a major is declared, according to the [105-credit rule](https://registrar.washington.edu/registration/policies-procedures/).
* run your dars (**d**egree **a**udit and **r**eport **s**ystem) featured on myplan periodically to check your academic progress. when in doubt, do not hesitate to seek for help, even for level 1 or 2 majors.

&#x200b;

# 2. registration

in november, you will have your first registration at uw as an enrolled student. and the registration is always a pain to rant about. here i am providing some strategies on how to painlessly register for your classes.

&#x200b;

**2.1 your registration date**

you can see your registration for the upcoming quarter during week 4 of the current quarter on myuw. and your [registration date (winter 2023 as an example)](https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-priorwi23/) is based on your [class standing](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/undergraduate-class-standings/), **not year at uw**. if you don't pay attention, do not worry. you can simply look it up by typing on the searching bar on your browser:

https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-prior**\[quarter\]\[year\]**/

* \[quarter\]: **au - autumn**, **wi - winter**, **sp - spring, su - summer**
* \[year\]: **last 2 digits of the calendar year (e.g. 22 as 2022)**

&#x200b;

**2.2 registration periods:**

* period 1: friday of week 6 to sunday of week 8
* period 2: monday of week 9 to the last day before the upcoming quarter starts
* period 3: the first week of the upcoming quarter
* **note that the registration for period 2 and 3 starts at 00:00 midnight, not 06:00 am! for example, if period 1 registration for autumn 2022 is may 6th to june 19th, then period 2 registration starts at 00:00 on june 20th!**
* **incoming freshmen are registering for fall classes during the a&o, so please ignore the period 1 restrictions if autumn 2022 is your first quarter at uw.**

&#x200b;

**2.3 platform**

use **sln page** to register. myplan sometimes drive people crazy.

&#x200b;

**2.4 check the requirements & restrictions**

before the registration starts, please **check** whether you satisfied the requirements or not. the most common are:

* you need to be in certain majors to register during period 1, 2, or 3
* you need to a certain class standing to register during period 1, 2, or 3
* you need either 0.7 (d-), 1.7 (c-), 2.0 (c), 2.2 (c+), or 3.0 (b) to be eligible for advanced courses
* you need to be matriculated student **(45 uw credits)**

&#x200b;

**2.4.1 example (mgmt 402): major & class standing restrictions**

[mgmt 402 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/eovpphiqtsv81.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9fc67e2b1842047fe1df1da7f0cae871037dd2)

to be eligible for mgmt 402, you need:

* have 90 or more total credits earned (junior status)
* admitted to foster, or you must wait until june 20th or your registration date

&#x200b;

**2.4.2 example (math 125): major & class & prereq restrictions**

[math 125 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/5484bjvkvsv81.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=300ed8a17e907f0a741fc264f5fffd500982cefd)

[math 125 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/t212eybnvsv81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=0605bcee18452dd2d35d88947995ff88e7380f75)

to be eligible for math 125, you need:

* finish \*math 124 or have equivalent ap/ib exam scores
* not in math, stat, or acms majors
* **the ""cancellation in effects"" means that if you ended up a 1.9 and lower on math 124, the registration system will remove you from math 125 when the grade is posted.**

\*math 124 has no prerequisite unless you took math 120 (need 2.5+).

i’ve never been a “math person” and have struggled with the subject throughout high school. i’m really worried about being absolutely obliterated by a pre req math class and consequently risking my chances of getting into my desired major. if there are any current students who are similarly shit at math and who were admitted into pre-social sciences, i’d love to hear your experiences with the major. thank you!",advice

"should i attend udub hello everyone!

i am currently in a dilemma as to whether i should attend udub (university of washington) as an oos resident. for context, i am a californian student who got accepted to udub and directly admitted to biochemistry. i plan on pursuing pre-med; however, because the future is so unnpredictable, this might change. should i back out of pre-med, i plan to pursue either engineering or cs. 

as for about myself, i consider myself to be a very hardworking student. i go to a fairly competitive high school in the bay area, and have maintained all as throughout my high school except in english 9h (so my gpas is around 3.94uw). i taken a total of 8 ap courses (all as) and got all 4s and 5s on them. i am willing to take initiative and grasp any opportunities that come into my way. i consider myself to be very studious and am always willing to improve or put effort to understand any concepts better.

based on all that, i was wondering if i will be able to hold the academic rigor that uwash has so that i can get into a good medical school? uwash has so many amazing opportunities, and i absolutely love the campus. however, what is really holding me back is the academic rigor that might affect my gpa. is it worth the oos tuition as opposed to instate?

"uw nursing and community college nursing programs just wanted to give some information to anyone wanting to attend uw for its nursing program. i made a post about two years ago talking about my experience with nursing prerequisites at uw and getting rejected from the uw nursing program twice (you can go back and look at my post). 

after getting rejected from uw nursing the second time, i started applying to associate degree programs in the seattle metro area, including north seattle college, seattle central college, south seattle college, shoreline community college, and lake washington institute of technology. i got into the associate degree in nursing program at lake washington institute of technology in fall 2020 and will be graduating this june. for anyone who is worried about not being able to get a certain job or get into a hospital position without a bachelor’s in nursing, those fears are unfounded. with a year or so of hospital experience as a nursing assistant and while i am still enrolled in school, i was able to get a job offer with two different hospitals in their nurse residency programs. i don’t even graduate for another two months and i am not even enrolled in a rn-bsn program yet, and i still got hospital job offers. 

what this means for current and prospective uw students looking to study nursing is this: uw nursing is not the only option for getting your nursing degree, and community colleges are an amazing option to pursue your nursing education. you will most likely be able to get a job in a hospital before you even graduate. with regards to prerequisites, community colleges offer smaller class sizes, it is easier to get better grades (no curves and weird competitiveness), and they are much cheaper (~$3900 per quarter at uw versus ~$1300 per quarter at north seattle college (most wa state community colleges are pretty similar in cost iirc)). the entire cost of my nursing program at lake washington institute of technology was maybe $16,000 over six quarters, plus there were technology grants and scholarships available as well, whereas uw costs around $24,000 over six quarters (correct me if i am wrong). you also do not need to spend a huge amount of money attending seattle university or seattle pacific university just to have your bsn degree a few months sooner. community college nursing programs also have application cycles 2 or 3 times per year, whereas uw only has admissions in january once per year, meaning that if you receive a rejection for fall quarter, you can apply again for winter quarter without a problem rather than waiting another ten months to apply again.  

one concern as well many people have about associate degree in nursing programs is that you will eventually have to get a rn-bsn degree. both hospitals i interviewed with told me that they have scholarship programs, both full and partial, to pay for you to get your rn-bsn. you can work full-time as a nurse and complete your rn-bsn, since classes meet (at least at uw bothell) once every two weeks. (i believe seattle children’s does require you to have your bsn for new hires, but i know people who have been working there as a nursing assistant and are able to get a job as a nurse there).

if you are a prospective student looking to come to uw for nursing or even if you are a current pre-nursing student at uw taking their prerequisites, i would recommend looking at taking your prerequisites (or the remainder of them) at a community college to save money, get higher grades without a curve, and have smaller class sizes to develop relationships with professors for recommendations. apply to multiple nursing programs at community colleges and apply every quarter you can, so that you can maximize your chances of getting into one as soon as possible and start your education and career. still apply to uw for nursing, and if you get in you should definitely attend since uw is one of the best nursing schools in the country. but do not sit around and wait a whole other year to try again if you do not get in the first time. i’m sure it changed in the year or so since i applied, but when i applied the first time in 2019, 80 students out of ~700 got in, and the second time i applied in 2020, 80 students out of ~600 got in. don’t put all your eggs in one basket by only focusing on the uw program. you will be an amazing nurse no matter where you go to school as long as you put in the effort and stay curious.

**info application essay advice:**

**present yourself as matching the informatics school mission/values/self-descriptors:**

<i wish i could just put my screenshot here, but refer page 2-3 of this brochure for the mission statement and descriptions. frame yourself in what they describe> [https://issuu.com/uwischool/docs/infobrochure\_2020](https://issuu.com/uwischool/docs/infobrochure_2020)

""a program that focuses on computer systems from a user-centered perspective and studies the structure, behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store, process and communicate information. includes instruction in information sciences, human computer interaction, information system analysis and design, telecommunications structure and information architecture and management.""

its not just tech (cs is about making the best tech), not just people (that’s social sciences), not just information. privacy, security, legal, intellectual property, human factors in tech, web and mobile development, social media, politics, the tech world, statistics, journalism.

make sure its clear you know what informatics is and that **you specifically** fit it (you don’t actually have to know what informatics is, i barely do, so say what they say)

&#x200b;

**this is about you**

what classes or things peaked curiosity, why are you here, what is important to you specifically.

really think about why you like informatics, why did you choose it, what is it about you that will make you good at it.

* i didn't think i cared that much about informatics until i worked on this essay, i realized why i really wanted to get in.

have a focused idea/topic/goal for the essay and make sure it is clear. this i struggled with. the essay prompt is barely a prompt, it's more like things they want you to mention.

topic ideas: (but please use stuff that actually works for you, erase these from your mind before brainstorming)

* how you found informatics, how you found whatever informatics concentration you like, something you struggled with (like communicating your ideas, finding your role, personal stuff) that info helps with, a specific instance, or an experience you had like club/job/volunteer/school.

try to make a story; doesn’t have to be super narrative, but show your growth don’t just brag.

* mine wasn't a single narrative story, i talked about the three times i have done projects about prison advocacy, and used it to show my progression over time getting better at communicating ideas as i got more into informatics.

don’t write it like a paper or resume, its about your connection to it and the humanistic aspects of the program. write it to be understandable for someone who isn’t in informatics, because some of the reviewers (apparently) aren’t informatics people.

""highlight your passion about the subject (could talk about a project you did during info 200/201 and how you wanted to expand on it). see if you can expand on it.""

be yourself and show who **you** are, but don't feel bad about creating a smarter/kinder/girlbossier/informatics version of yourself

&#x200b;

**here’s how i broke down the prompt:**

(but smoosh all the questions together into one story)

**experiences with information**.

how have you used tech/data to help you/others or if you haven't really, how can you using tech/data help the next generation

do you not have “experiences with information technology”? i'm sure there is stuff you can still write about and this is broad enough that i’m sure you have an experience with information, especially related to diversity/equity.

* clubs, personal projects, volunteering, personal relationships, social media, organizations. anything related to information technology or data or the internet could work

but it can’t hurt to find some if what you have doesn’t feel compelling:

* use projects from the info classes you took, making sure that you show how that experience was specific to you or your life to differentiate yourself from everyone else who also took those classes.

get a job/ extracurriculars. maybe it doesn’t have to be super social justicey or perfect, but just to show experience

extracurriculars:

* info viz
* hackathons or computer science clubs/groups
* poduw (polling and open data initiative)
* if you want to do design:
   * huskyadapt; seal lab; design for america
* swe
* other techy rso’s or any rso where you can be the web design/techy person for them
* do volunteer data entry or data related stuff for a non-profit, look at [volunteermatch.org](http://volunteermatch.org/)

i was stressed so really wanted stuff like this to look better. i didn’t end up talking about it in depth but i bet you could get a whole story out of it. i mentioned data entry volunteering for a nonprofit but it was more helpful because i thought of my whole idea from connecting it to the rest of my life.

also remember they don’t fact check you so… go ahead and make it sound cooler than it was

&#x200b;

**experiences with diversity, equity, and inclusion**

not solely focusing on your identity/oppression, make sure its related to how technology played a negative or positive role in it, and then tie it to what you did/want to do to change it (preferably using information technology). it doesn't have to be as related to tech as the last question, but make sure your ""backstory"" actually flows with the whole essay.

possible things

* intersections of your identity
* advocacy
* political exclusion and technological exclusion
* misinformation is something they really care about
* social media

this is the ""human-centered"" part of informatics, show that you care about people and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

&#x200b;

**goals after college**

if you don’t have a specific career goal, approach it as how the major matches with your values and personal goals.

* i talked about combining helping people and advocacy with a logical, practical base. and how moving around a bunch of majors let me know info was good for me in the future

find faculty or a specific class or what about the school that will help further goals, this will make them think the i school is central to your future and you can't get it anywhere else.

* it could help to name drop one of your professors and say you’re interested in their work.
* look into research groups at the i school
   * i talked about wanting to learn about the center for informed public group and masters programs.

info is a backup major for a lot of people, and its also broad enough that it can be a catch-all. convince the reader that info specifically is what you need and want.

“show how you’ve made a positive impact on the world around you and describe how you being an info major will help you to continue on this trajectory""

what is it about informatics and about yourself that will make you stick with this in the future.

&#x200b;

**learning skills**

brag about your grade for a class, and make sure it ties into the rest of the essay. this wasn't super central to my essay approach so i don't have much advice for it; though i'm sure there's a way to make the whole story about your class experience and you coming out with a good grade. they don't care much about your grades so use this as an opportunity to highlight your academic best.

&#x200b;

**general essay advice**

700 words is a short essay, make sure it is straightforward and cohesive (do as i say not as i do) and there's a clear point that you successfully gets across -ask people if it gets across.

reach out to informatics advisors or ta’s or professors

utilize drop in tutoring at study center or use clue

get feedback on what you write, even if you, like me, hate people reading your writing. i am very grateful for my friend who read my first draft and said ""this sh\*t makes no sense, it's making my dyslexia worse"". that hurted, but i needed it.

start early, i thought i started early and still worked on it up to when it was due. start earlier. talk through your ideas with people and get people to read your stuff, then restart- ask early on so it is constructive.

anytime you think about informatics, write it down for later because you can use it. this essay forced me to be very introspective for a while. maybe i am just an over-thinker, but still, brainstorm for a long time. (i did get caught up on trying to use all of it, so be mindful that not everything can be included).

give yourself the best chance with a well written essay. i do think content is most important -i actually had a few typos. (please don't bring it up i'm so embarrassed)

&#x200b;

**a collection of other people’s blocks of advice:**

(this is not cited i am very sorry but i genuinely don't remember who said what)

1:

show how you’ve made a positive impact on the world around you and describe how you being an info major will help you to continue on this trajectory. think of something that’s a big part of your life and talk about how you used it to make a positive impact and if you don’t have anything like that, find something. they care a lot about being passionate

2:

tell a overarching narrative: “for me, i like design, so i explained how i started off in polisci, but i found that it was too theoretical, and not practical. i learned in polisci how inequitable the world is, but no matter the studying i did, i couldn’t change the world around me. then i found design. i could make things to physically change the world around me, and i fell in love. “

be explicit with your previous experiences : “i participated in x rso, and i designed y for z to make it more equitable.” tie it into the overarching narrative. “i made things with my hands, and i saw how much i was able to impact someone’s life for the better, without us, they would’ve faced x inequality.”

be explicit why info: “i learned a lot in x rso, and i learned how much i want to be a designer post college to make the world around me more equitable. informatics will allow me to do that because it offers me x resources, unlike y.”

3:

paragraph 1: talk about a hardship that you have faced - preferably one that is from systemic bias.

paragraph 2: talk about how you persevered, despite said hardship.

paragraph 3: talk about how your perseverance sparked a passion to work on solving that hardship for others.

paragraph 4: talk about how you learned about the ischool while becoming passionate about working on that hardship's solution.

paragraph 5: talk about why you feel the ischool will best help you gain the tools you need to help others with this hardship (since you plan on making this passion your lifelong pursuit). (be specific here. mention a faculty that you feel would be a great resource or mentor because of some specific work (s)he has done. especially if he or her was one of your 200 instructors ***and likes you*** or is on the admission board.)

4:

**tip #1: start your application essay early! this means brainstorming, drafting, and all of the basic writing processes. create a good list in your brainstorming of projects you could talk about or any social experiences that made an impact on you.**

my first essay read like a resume and that was not the key at all. the essay (if the prompt is the same as mine) should be a story about you and a specific experience(s) that where you learned from and applied the views/values/mission of the ischool's pillars.

sure, getting rejected the first time hurt a lot because it increased my anxiety about not having a major. however, the key is to keep grinding and have no regrets. therefore, on my second try, i put in a lot more time and effort. my google doc draft ended up having 40+ pages of notes and drafts that i took over the span of 3 months because i kept editing the same essay. if i got rejected here - then it would still hurt, but i would have no regrets because i did my 100% best on the application. 

**tip #2: a growth mindset is very important. being able to bounce back from failure and be even better is important. put your 100% effort into things and have no regrets about the outcome. expect the worse; but hope for the best.**

i'm still experiencing this mindset right now in my internship interview processes after getting mountains of rejections and no offers. it hurts - but i believe in myself and i'm grinding for my optimism! 

**tip #3: learning how to scope your essay and focusing on specific experiences in my life helped me describe how i implemented the ischool's values into my thinking and learning.** talk about what you've learned from info classes like this class and how you applied that to your future experiences of doing things - work, academics, hackathons, etc.

**tip #4: have a clear goal of what you want to do and communicate your journey with it.** your pursuit of passion should be clear and not vague at all.

tip #5: **understand that the ischool doesn't need their applicants - the applicants need the ischool so make sure to talk about how the ischool's resources will let you reach your goal.** for example, i talked about the possibility of working with specific professors in the tech policy lab and i brought examples of what i learned from info 300 into my work experiences.

**tip #6: take more info classes other than info 200 and info 201.** this step may not be absolutely necessary; but, it can help you understand the principles of informatics as a whole. i took info 300 and the 3 classes alone were able to help me get the major. however, i have gotten tips to take as many info classes as you can so you can talk about how you implemented aspects of what you learned from the class to your story.

**tip #7: make sure your essay is a story about you.** assume that they are going to read your essay one time through because they're tired of reading applications all day. reading boring resumes like my first essay definitely didn't make an impact on them. however, writing a story about myself and my journey towards my goal of ""\[becoming\] an aspiring software engineer... to design empathy-driven technology so information can be universally accessible"" made it clear what i wanted to do.

i literally had my info 300 professor read over my essay and he said it was straight-up boring. the guy literally plugged in the hero's journey chart into my google doc as well and i got traumatic high-school english flashbacks. but it made sense why he did that. 

**tip #8: use as many resources as you can. this means showing your paper to friends, family, professors, tas, the info student admission helpers, the writing center, etc.** they will provide criticism on what is clear, what can be improved, and what should be emphasized. also, make sure to ask for their first impressions because you must hit all of the marks on the dot right from the get-go. ultimately, you don't have to implement all of their feedback, and it's up to you to choose which feedback would be beneficial for your vision because not all of the feedback you get will be constructive towards that target.

**tip #9: try to read the essays of admitted students to see what aspects they emphasize to align with the values of the ischool.** however, take this with a grain of salt because you definitely do not want to copy them. it's your story you're writing about, not theirs.

**backups for informatics:**

* geographical information studies
* design major
* foster information systems path
* do minor in informatics which isn’t capacity constrained
* panic and pick something random (most majors have a data science concentration)
* do something and then get a masters like the msim or msds
* check the rest of uw reddit there’s plenty of ideas (uw restricting majors is so dumb and its so stupid that we have to think up backup majors when we’re giving them money this school is dumb)

mandatory disclaimer: this is what worked for me, it might not work for you. maybe this advice isn't even necessary for anyone else but me. try to read a few people's essays or ask what they wrote about to see which approach can work for you.

are there any possible scenarios where the kid's explanation holds water? one thing i can hypothesize is that the kid applied for early graduation (attending ceremony before finishing their last semester; not sure if udub has such an option), attended graduation, then cancelled their last semester before the class drop deadline, ultimately not completing their courses yet.",advice

"transfer decision hello,

i am currently a sophomore student aspiring to be a software engineering or any career related to that field. but i have been currently stuck in deciding for my next steps. 

i recently got accepted at uw seattle for its acms (dma) major as a transfer student from a community college. i applied for cs allen school as my first major choice but apparently i got rejected from the cs department i aimed for. apparently, i also got accepted to the csse major at uw bothell.

in terms of career prospect, what should i decide between the acms (dma) major at uw seattle and csse major at uw bothell? i initially thought that the dma program would be closely related to cs but i am worried that i would not be either enjoying the major itself or i will find difficulties in finding jobs with this degree. i have many connections of cs graduates who currently works at big tech companies and i could only find a single person who actually graduated with the acms (dma) major but he's currently working as quality engineer (i have done a little research about it but i'm still not sure what it is all about). 

a few things about myself, i am personally not a math person even though i don't often struggle with the concepts. i really enjoy coding/programming in general, i like building stuffs with programming but i also appreciate optimizations of algorithm to speed things up (e.g. data structures) which i believe are the things we learn from cs major. i have even built some fun side programming projects such as websites and discord bot myself. and as i said, i applied to acms as my 2nd choice since i believe it is close to cs and i felt like i would have no problem dealing with the math. i have taken linear algebra and ordinary differential equations with no issue and i got perfect 4.0 gpa for both. i feel like uw bothell's csse has good reputations but i find some friends of mine struggle a lot in getting internships and jobs. it must definitely be a struggle to get jobs from either school but i have always believed that uw seattle has greater opportunities in that regard. also may be unrelated with everything, i am not sure if this would also be a factor but i am actually an international student (from indonesia) and so are most of my friends (or connections) who i referred to.

would anyone mind giving some insights to this problem i have? i would really appreciate any thoughts on this. thank you in advance.",advice

i am currently a student at paul allen. i transferred in fall 2021. after 2 quarters there i have learned that i don’t care for the curriculum or the vibe. additionally the course load is frankly impossible to manage with having both a physical disability and learning disability. 

one option i am considering (aside from transferring out) is changing majors. i have considered amath but the acceptance rate for internal students is 16%. 

i would like to major in stem and get a masters in public health when i’m done. most stem majors at uw appear to be capacity constrained.

i've been living in the u-district for two years now, and holy shit, i had no idea things could get as bad as they have with my current landlord. i don't want to name him publicly until i move out at the end of this month out of concern for retaliation, but if you pm me i'll gladly give his name. i have been forced to live in absolutely disgusting conditions that the landlord either refuses to fix or at least refuses to hire outside help for. my freezer doesn't work and he ignored my text about it. my wall was leaking orange goop, and he said it must be a leak, ""took a look"", and then decided it wasn't a leak. i did the research and found out it was because he didn't dehumidify the space before painting the walls, and i told him that. he literally just said ""that's so strange"" as orange goop was slowly dripping onto everything i owned. the apartment feels soaking wet. everything gets moldy. there's nowhere to store shit in a way that doesn't get moldy. his solution was to give us a single dehumidifier, and not do his job to find out why the apartment is wet to the fucking touch. slugs were entering our home for several months. how did slugs get in? there are roots growing through the seal on my window. our billion year old stove spontaneously ignited. he took the batteries out of our carbon monoxide detectors and said it was because he was going to give us new ones. that was nine months ago. 

so please, share the names and companies that have fucked you over. nobody deserves to live in such disgusting conditions. we thought the landlord seemed like a good guy, but oh my god. he completely ignored my last text telling him that our freezer isn't working right. i've easily lost $100 or more on food that was no longer safe because it completely thawed and i don't feel like getting listeria!

-phys 322, bc i just finished phys 321 but honestly i did pretty shit in the class. on one hand i want to continue to keep the momentum and get it over with, but on the other i want a break and to also take it in a 10 week quarter. this class was my plan (am talking to profs, getting permission for time overlap) but now i'm reconsidering bc summer's only 8 weeks.
-chem 162
-phys 324, time overlap, would have to get it resolved
-phys 334, time overlap

the house is a 3 floor unit in a duplex. you get the master bedroom with a private bathroom with shower, closet, and south facing window to the street so at least there's a nice view for when you contemplate your life choices. the room is furnished with a queen bed, desk, and white board. 

there are two roommates, my cousin (f) and my brother. my cousin is taiwanese and is almost never home. my brother lives on the basement floor and is not very social so you won't see him much either but if you are trying to get into cs you should try to make friends with him because he is a very talented programmer and can help you with your math/physics/cs homework.

i still could not believe what had happened. i am a 6-foot-tall, 220 pounds, masculine guy. and i was in my karate gi, on my way to practice. it was around 6 pm, the platform was full of people.

i would think this will make me the least likely target for anyone to pick up a fight on the street, as well as the worst time, right? nope. this man bumped straight into me and kept aggression toward me for a couple of minutes, in a combat-ready stance.

i tried to break the engagement distance, and kept trying to talk him out of this while retreating in a fully defensive stance. he threats to beat me up, and i was cornered to the end of the platform. i felt adrenaline rushing, and i'm out of choice. lucky the train came just in time, and i am able to get out of there as he did not follow me.

this man is an african american, about 6 to 6 feet 1, 230 - 240 pounds. chubby build, with long beards. his behavior (movement, language) seems a bit off, might be on drugs. please be careful if you see him.

i was scared. he might as well as be armed with a knife, or possibly with a firearm? what if the train didn't come? we would have had a really bad fight--i can feel his hostile intention. i have absolutely nothing on me, except my bare hand. i am a 6 feet, 220-pound man, with martial arts training. but i was still sacred, very.

consider this is mid of the day, and i am not even alone, shits still happen. i felt the need for more self-defense measures. however, after looking through university policy, anything i could think of -- pistol, taser, knives, brass knuckles, batons, pepper sprays. all prohibited. i felt powerless realizing if this happens again, i could do nothing to prepare, and nothing if he choose to harm me.

i'm sure no one has taken both, so they can't be directly compared, but any anecdotal evidence would be nice. i was accepted into the tacoma program and am still waiting to hear back from bothell, but i'm unsure which one i would choose if i had to.

the course load and curriculum seem pretty similar, but the main differences are tacoma is in python while bothell is in c++, and tacoma has classes on saturdays while bothell has classes mw evening. also the tacoma professors seem very engaged and passionate, but i haven't seen anything about the bothell professors. i would rather learn c++, but i'm worried that the bothell program may not be as high quality as the tacoma program. does anyone have any experience or advice?",academics

i would consider myself more of an introverted type of person and was wondering, would the extra 2 credits of work from the fig gen st 199 be worth it in exchange for the social benefits it provides (if any) through its cohort system? would the extra work be too overwhelming?

also, i am currently signed up for econ 200 as a 40-student lecture (no quiz section) taught by a graduate student. i have heard that these graduate students are often hit-or-miss when it comes to instructional quality. would you recommend this, or should i change to the 700-person lecture with a quiz section taught by professor knox who apparently has mediocre reviews on rmp?

"how to improve my chances of getting into a uofwa i was not a good academic student in high school. i messed around a lot and focused on sports more than my education. after high school, i took a couple of months off to figure out what i needed to do to become a better student. i enrolled in a washington state community college close to my home (bellingham, wa) where i did 10 credits for 2 quarters. so i'm sitting at 20 college credits. in my first quarter, i got a 3.7 gpa and in the other quarter, i received a 4.0 gpa.

here is where my problem begins.

i want to get into uw, it looks like uw has a 50% acceptance rate for transfer students and i also need 40 credits to be considered a transfer student. i want to take 20 credits this next quarter and hope i get a solid gpa. since my major is competitive (biology) i have to take 2 stem classes at this community college. would it truly be worth it to take 20 full credits in hopes that i get good grades to transfer to this school?",advice

ps, if anyone have leases they don't want now or is aware of places that still rents, please put up an offer or tell me,  i'd love to see what's out there.

i am an upcoming freshman at wwu in the honors program. 

i've lived in washington my whole life, and have always wanted to attend uw. it's been my dream college- i love the school and i love seattle. 

i applied to uw and uw honors as a high school senior, sporting a 3.9 gpa, multiple ap classes, and few hundred hours logged of community service / volunteering. despite my portfolio and various professors proof-reading my essays, i was waitlisted and eventually denied admission to the school. i suppose that it was a fairly competitive year of admissions.

i ended up going to wwu as part of their honors program, and i am about to start my first quarter.

i understand how premature this is, but i want to start thinking about transferring to uw for autumn quarter next year. i understand that i have been at wwu for a considerably tiny amount of time, but through my few interactions with professors and through other stories i have heard about wwu, i don't think this is the place for me. the strong liberal basis of their teaching is too much for even me, a democrat. of course, i have plenty of time to reassess, but for right now, i have some questions that i would really appreciate being answered:

how difficult is it to transfer to uw from a 4-year university? 

i've heard the acceptance rate is low for 4-year transfers, but is there anything specific that i can do that would bolster my chances?

can i reapply to the interdisciplinary honors program at uw as a second-year transfer?

i'm a colorado junior, who's thinking applying to uw for pre-med next year(either biology or another related science major.) i really love the idea of attending this school - seattle has always been a city i've wished to live in, the liberal environment is enticing, the school itself is amazing, and it has a beautiful campus. i believe i have extremely high chances of getting in, but the price tag scares me a bit. for an out of state student, the price tag is around 50k annually. if you subtract grants and federal aid from that, its around 40k a year. (120k total) my parents have expressed that they a) cannot help me pay for college (they don't make that much, and i have multiple other siblings), and b) aren't willing to do so. so, i'd basically be on my own. i probably cannot get state residency, and neither am i willing to.

i guess my question(s) are: is the school worth it? all factors considered, and the fact that i'd probably go to med school after, is it worth the massive debt?

is there any other way to pay for it? (besides loans).

* the cultural awareness you've developed
* a challenge faced
* a personal hardship or barrier overcome

**directions:** tell a story from your life, describing an experience that either demonstrates your character or helped to shape it. \*

"i'd like to hear from other people like this cw mental illness

it's weird because i know i'm not a special case, and there definitely are other people who struggle with something like this, but i've never heard about it.

i'm doing really bad in one of my chem class, and every single time i'm about to ask for help from a ta, or i'm about to go to the chem study center, i can't. i don't mean i get too nervous or shy. when i'm about to ask for help, i end up having an extreme panic attack. i mean i can't speak, and i'll be trembling so much i can't write properly. i'll usually start tearing up, or hyperventilating.

this is because i wanted to ask a question, and that's it. 

it's because of my ptsd. if i ever asked my mom for help with my homework as a kid, she would get so mad at me. she'd yell or threaten to hit me. so now when i'm about to ask for help, my brain still sets off alarms and tells me that it's not safe. that i'm going to get hurt if i do that. even despite every ounce of me knowing that's not true anymore, it used to be. and now it's just like an instinctual reaction that i can't control. i try so fucking hard to fight it, but it's just a part of me. 

i don't even know how to start asking for help. i've considered writing something down and showing it to the ta when i ask him for chem help, but i don't want to waste his time when he could be helping other people who are actually able to voice what they are trying to ask. sometimes it makes me worry that i'm still too sick to be here. believe it or not, this reaction i have is a huge improvement to how it used to be. it used to be much worse.

this survey will remain active from oct 31, 2022 until nov 15, 2022 after which i'll tally the votes and summarize its findings to share with the broader rental tenant community.

questions i'm hoping to get answered:

\- what types of property manager (e.g. owner/operator, on-site property manager, off-site property manager) have you worked with in the past?

\- what is your top goal as a renter (e.g. temp, long-term, rent to buy eventually, get government funding)

\- what are your most resource-intensive/painful/urgent challenges as a tenant?

\- what workarounds/solutions do you currently leverage to mitigate against your top challenges noted above?

\- on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), how satisfied are you with the current workarounds/solutions listed above? why?

if you prefer to not answer publicly, a dm is always appreciated.

* sat: 1490 (770 math, 720 english)
* extracurriculars: member of school's coding club for 3 years (not an officer), did research with professors from oregon health science university and university of texas san antonio in computational biology and ai.

issues with my application:

i am currently enrolled in ap calculus bc, but at my school there is a group of math individuals who are 1 year ahead (currently enrolled in linear algebra & multivariable calculus). however, while i am not in those classes i do know both subjects quite well as both of my mentors made it a point for me to learn them and so i have self-studied both over the past 3 years. so i don't really know how to get that across as part of my research. 

my school has a mst (magnet) program that i am currently not in. i never really applied for it and so i wasn't able to be a part of this research program. however, i think that a major part of my application is research-based so the fact that im not in my school's stem research program is hard for me to explain.   


advice:  
if anyone has any advice for how to explain the two inconsistencies in my application that would be amazing. i was thinking of using the optional essay but i don't really have a reason besides my school denied my request to take math over the summer or move up and i don't know if ""well i am not in the classes but i do know the subjects"" is a viable excuse.

this class was not the most exciting class, but presented some difficulty as there is some programming with pandas and jupyter. this class explored the health systems and the intersections between informatics and medicine. there were a lot of assignments that i found didn't help with learning, and the professor did not go over how to do the code (he just assumed that you would be able to do it because the prereq is info 201). a lot of students felt lost, and a lot of my group-mates straight up did not help with group projects (but this is probably due to being online). the only things graded are reading responses, group projects, presentations, and participation.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* reading responses due tuesdays and thursdays
* oral presentation (tell-a-story). this is very lowkey, you get to choose your topic and story to tell.
* 3 team projects. these involve a coder and a writer, but the professor ended up not balancing this so well with teams. make sure to try and get more than 2 people in a team. from my memory, there is some data handling with thousands of medical data which involves filtering, analyzing clinical notes, and finding genetic data to prescribe medical advice.
* lateness policy on a case-by-case basis, doesn't provide late days for assignments.

easy 4.0? more like ez 3.5 - prof is a harsh grader zzz

professor: john gennari

\* lots busy work :( and lots of time teaching yourself jupyter if you have never used it before. i also was assigned as the coder for most of the projects, so i was paired with freshman/sophomores that have never taken a coding course somehow (info 201 is a suggested prereq, not required).

&#x200b;

**info 486 - designing for personal health and wellness:**

i thoroughly enjoyed this course. most work is done with group projects, developing an app to promote personal health and wellness. we get to explore how to make these sorts of apps effective with high usability. the professor was super engaging and accommodating. i definitely felt like i learned the most from this course. it gave a similar learning vibe as info 360, with plenty of time to work with your groups in class.

the labs were definitely the most redundant, but you need to attend for credit.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* reading responses (30%), due before every class (twice a week)
* group project (40%). this is graded by multiple deliverables throughout the quarter.
* individual assignments (15%). written reflection papers, lab assignments.
* participation (15%). this is very loosely graded. i took this online and you only needed to 'react' every once in a while.
* slightly strict with deadlines, but will accommodate with you if there is a good reason.

**bime 435 - informatics in healthcare:**

bime 300 but less code, more app design. the course goes more in depth about the healthcare systems and technology. i honestly can't recall enjoying this course very much, but it followed the basic standards of an info class with developing an app without any programming. the professor is super kind and doesn't grade harshly. labs were mostly recaps/time to work with your groups.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* buying the book is not necessary.
* course topics:
   * the us healthcare system
   * foundations of informatics in healthcare
   * application in clinical informatics
* weekly assignments (35%). quizzes, discussion boards, other assignments. quizzes are fairly easy if you skim the assigned readings.
* labs (35%)
* final project (30%). written and oral reports, had to present with group in front of the class about the project we developed.
* late assignments can be turned in at a cost of a few points (can't earn full credit).

**info 478 - population health informatics:**

coding, coding, coding. get ready to use the r language that you learned about 2 years ago. the lecture content was extremely boring to me, and since it was an 8:30 am class, i have to be transparent and say i barely went to class. she recorded lectures so i definitely used panapto to go back when she explains certain topics or assignments. i would honestly recommend *not* skipping lectures, as they were helpful for the assignments. this class is all about data visualization and representation. you have assignment deliverables similar to info 201, as well as a final group project. i honestly don't know how i earned a 4.0, but i'm assuming that if i can do it, so can you :d

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* workbooks (30%) 1pt each every week.
* assignments (35%) 10 pts each, usually every week.
* course project (35%). you begin to work on this around 3 weeks before finals.
* super flexible grading. you can submit late work within a week and still get 100% credit.

# other courses to mention

**info 442 - cooperative software development:**

as you may be able to tell, i'm not a coder by any means. in this class, you get to create a team of 2 developers, 1 product manager, and 1 designer to *cooperatively develop* a web app. this course is similar to info 340 in that you will need to have some experience with front-end development. pm and designer definitely have the easier job. the lectures weren't exactly helpful to the overall project, but it was interesting to learn about how real products are made, including developing pitches, timelines, and program versions.

*for seniors thinking about capstone group formation, a lot of people (including myself and my team) found our teammates for capstone in this class. try to find people with similar project interests as you!*

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* going to class is required - you are graded based on creating your agenda each day with your team (what you accomplished the last week, what you're going to accomplish this week, and any questions you have for the ta/professor)
* labs are super easy activities. you learn about integrity, working with a team. i honestly hope they change the structure of this, it felt like a waste of time as a senior who already learned this 40 times during my time at uw.
* course reading is free and required. i learned a lot from the book and it helped with my understanding in the class. also, if you have your info 340 book, be prepared to keep that tab open.
* assigned and selected readings (14 pts)
* labs (20 pts)
* project assignments (56 pts)
* final presentation (10 pts)
* extra credit is available
* no penalty for late submission of *reading or lab assignments.*

\* difficulty will be based on what role you are. the developers definitely had the harder job, but as the pm, i did my best to support my team and offered extra insight/help.

&#x200b;

**cse 163 - intermediate data programming:**

i'm not a coder. i wanted to avoid cse 143 like the plague. i heard that this class is much easier and i believe this to be true. hunter is a great lecturer and is super engaging, the content that you learn is actually really helpful for other info courses/bhi track courses (you learn pandas, python, jupyter - would be great to take this before bime 300). the final project was definitely my favorite part of the class, we got to present our posters at the end in a fair. the grading is much more lenient, and you get resubmissions. i'd say the format is similar to cse 142, but there are no tests, just graded weekly checkpoints. i learned the best from the lectures, so don't skip those!

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* checkout any cse 163 website, [this](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163/22sp/) is the one from my quarter.

that's my personal experience with bhi! i do feel like i learned a lot of valuable skills and enjoyed my time in the program. a lot of the courses go over the same content, but also expanded on more topics with each class i took. i personally didn't realize how much coding there would be, especially in bime 300, but they were manageable.

"academic advice i have decided to write a post based on my personal opinions and those of my classmates in the program as well. hihim is a little known major at uw. hihim, also known as health informatics and health information management is a cahiim accredited program that enables you to take an rhia exam after. now, into the details, when looking at their website it appears to be competitive “we only take 50 students”. 

yes, that’s great but what if only thirty apply? there are about 38-41ish people in the first year hihim classes. ok… so it’s not competitive. classes are mondays and wednesdays when they are made to sound mondays, tuesdays, wednesdays and thursdays from 5-9pm in all application materials to the major. classes are in the evenings which i am fine with, (i did apply to the program after all). classes imply learning and teaching. each class (even the five credit class!) meets one day a week for less then two hours. the five credit class meets from 7:00-8:20 and that’s it. the professor of this class has given 1 lecture in the last 6 weeks. 1 lecture. i paid 2,250 dollars (fee based program) to uw only for the professor to lecture once and have students teach each other the rest of the time.

the other professor teaches two classes, one monday and one wednesday and surprise! the wednesday class is online so i only have one class a week in person. 12 credits that i am paying 5,100 for before student and activities fees and other fees. 

this program would be better if they didn’t hype it up to be amazing only to not teach. the program has such great potential in another format and if the professors lectured. i am very lucky i am good at making myself read the textbooks and study on my own time or i would not have learned anything besides the little bits of material taught by the professors.

i will say, studying is the best way to learn but it’s one thing to teach yourself a couple concepts and entirely different thing to teach yourself for an entire quarter for three separate classes. 

the professors have you teach yourself (a good way to learn!) but never lecture (what are we paying them for?) keep in mind, hihim is a fee based bachelors program so it’s a lot more expensive then the tuition i was paying previously. 

the teachers are inconsistent with assignment formatting and have poorly made slides but expect a lot from assignments. for example, a 4-5 page paper (single spacing, no breaks after paragraphs with cover sheet and apa bibliography with a 2 paragraph summary for each source) was assigned this monday and is due this sunday. 

respect is built on trust. i feel as though i placed my trust in the hihim program and they broke that trust by hyping up the program to be great and then having it all be self taught and homework. it feels like they are making me pay them to teach myself, or alternatively i am paying them 30,000+ dollars for a two year program in which i am teaching myself and not relying on the professors to teach (their job). 

this is in no way meant to be negative, i am merely informing people about the program like i wish someone had informed me. the program has so much potential if the professors actually taught besides assigning readings and presentations for the students to give every single class”

"is udub a good choice for someone interested in environmental science? i toured the campus and i completely fell in love with how pretty it is and also it seems so quiet which i love. i heard es isn’t as competitive here so higher chance of me getting in but also that uw has an amazing research budget to support research and internships. also from what i heard the gen ed classes are as big as 200 students but as you lean more towards your major they get smaller and you get to know your professors more. i hope to become an environmental science researcher or an environmental science policy analyst and seattle is the perfect hub for environmental science jobs.

uw ranks near top 20 for most lgbtq friendly places, i am a closeted asexual lesbian living with my homophobic parents. i also have adhd/gad and the diversity union seems accepting of neurodivergent and queer people which i really like. 

my academics/extracurriculars:

i’m a senior now and in my junior year i got a 4.0 gpa unweighted (4.3 weighted). sophomore year during height of covid and online learning i got a 4.0 gpa. i’m on track to finish this semester with a 4.0 gpa. right now i’m taking dual enrollment physics, dual enrollment language and composition, as well as ap bio, ap calc ab, and ap psych. i spend several hours a day participating in theatre as an actor (i leave school as late as 8:00pm everyday) and i am a competitive piano player. i am part of nhs and also a volunteer essay revisionist.

some downsides:

i did not apply for the honors college but hoping to apply in my freshman year. i live out of state. i prefer smaller class sizes due to adhd and needing accommodations. i was hoping for a liberal arts education so idk if i’ll get it from uw.

"in need of custom uw flag...we're surrounded by cougars! hey guys, i'm hoping someone can help me out here.

my brother owns a farm surrounded by wsu cougar fans. for christmas, we want to setup a giant ~20' uw agriculture flag on his barn to fight back a bit. :) something like this: https://i.imgur.com/m15h3zq.png

here's his request...

---------------------------------

for a christmas present, i’d love a large husky flag to hang on the side of my barn.

as you know, i have a 100 acre farm just off highway 2 between monroe and sultan.

my neighbor farmers, and nearly every farmer in western washington went to pullman. they all have custom wsu license plates and were really snooty before the apple cup last weekend. a few of them have painted their tractors crimson and put cougar decals on them. i’ve even seen a wsc flag with the word “agriculture” printed on the bottom margin of the flag.

because my large barn faces highway 2, it would be a great spot to hang a flag for everyone to see as they drive past. as a nod to all the local farmers who went to wsu, i was thinking that placing the word “agriculture” below the w logo would be a nice touch. my neighbors all have teenagers, so perhaps this could be seen as a recruiting opportunity for the university, and not just a friendly jab at the cougs.

i took a minute and grabbed a screenshot of the google street view of my barn as seen from eastbound hwy 2. i added a flag on the barn to represent my concept, and i pasted an image of the flag below. the font and spacing of the text could be improved; i just used the default font from my photo editor. the width of the flag on the barn is 20’, i don’t know what proportions ‘normal’ flags have, but assuming the souvenir 3’ x 5’ flags are standard, then the flag for my barn would be 12’ x 20’.

"living for less than 12 months but paying rent for 12 months? edit: living at nolan, the m, the accolade, oliv, hub u, or here seattle? please read this. 

i recently discovered that my apartment building uses a “12  instalment” system for my rent schedule but i’m only staying for 11 months and 8 days. all of those 12 instalments are equal (even for the month where i will only live for 8 days). they quoted “$1000/month” as my rent (figure changed). they are charging me $12,000 in total for 11 months and 8 days. but i think it should be $11,000 (for 11 months) + $266.66 (for 8 days) = $11,266.66 

on their website it says that rent is based on monthly frequency which means that $1000 is based on monthly frequency. but when i do the math $1000 only seems to cover for 28.5 days and not monthly frequency. (month means 30 days)

they said this is how it’s done and it’s all buildings do it. is this correct? i asked other people at similar name buildings (nolan, the m etc.) and they all knew about it and agree to this??? 

if divide $12000 by 11 months and 8 days, my monthly rent comes to $1064.77/month but that is not what was promised to me ($1000/month) 

am i not understanding this correctly?

edit 1: the amount of people equating 12 months with installments is proving to me that this is in fact a terrible way to phrase statements on a legal document. if you are living in any ‘name’ buildings (especially on brooklyn ave) please please please look at your lease and compute your monthly rent to see how much you are actually paying

edit 2: i researched more into this and found that only hub udistrict presents the fact correctly and coherently on their website [if you scroll towards the bottom of the page](https://www.americancampus.com/student-apartments/wa/seattle/hub-u-district-seattle/floor-plans#/detail/228-4bed-4bathstandard-fall2023_fullterm_9_23-8_24) “rates/installments do not represent a monthly rental amount (and are not prorated), but rather the total base rent due for the lease term divided by the number of installments.” this is the truth. the number that has been quoted to you is not your monthly rent. other apartments say “rent is based on monthly frequency” which is not even close to the truth.",discussion

"meeting people and partying outside of greeklife i have a really hard time meeting people in here. i consider myself very extraverted and confident, but it’s been a struggle for me and a skill i had to learn. a lot of the time people are taking classes with friends and not interested in making new ones, and speaking frankly a lot of the student body here is extremely introverted and socially awkward in general. it’s really gotten me down. i tried joining clubs but most of the clubs seem the same way too, people go with friends to do an activity and don’t talk to people they don’t know. i’ve made some friends in clubs but it’s tough because they’re activity rather than social based for the most part. there’s a couple good ones though, but many are really inactive as well as cliquish. they are also extraordinarly limited, for such an outdoorsy city it blows my mind that the winter sports clubs are the only outdoor clubs. (considering joining hws or snow club) i had a lot of interest in the sports clubs, but after tryouts the upsetting fact is that i am not athletic enough for college sports. i can workout and get in shape, but chances are by the time i am in good enough shape it will be too late. i also like partying. i know people always say “just go to house parties” but the fact of the matter is none of my non greek friends are going to parties, and most house parties tend to be a small group of close friends, which is pretty awful for meeting new people. i’ve never been invited to or seen a larger house party. i’m sure i can get invites if i keep making friends but this goes back to the original problem of uw and seattle being tough places to make friends in. the seattle club scene is a national joke unless you want to go to an lgbt club, and the bars i went to on the ave were a miserable experience. i had more fun and made more friends in the line at earls than i actually did inside earls. there’s this one frat that basically begs for guests but if you know who i am talking about you know they are good for nothing except a really good laugh. i rushed this quarter and had an awesome time. i got bids from a few fraternities with guys who’s company i really enjoyed. the fact of the matter is that it’s a huge commitment, and before making it i want to be 100% sure about the choice. are there any other alternatives to a social framework that i should take a look at? any clubs i should consider joining? i’m a hella outdoorsy guy, big on hiking, photography, backpacking, that sort of thing.

i contacted him asking about what my teacher was talking about but he just gave me an add code and a form to fill out called ""late add pettition for one course"" without telling what the purpose of all of this is. 

can you guys help me understand what my professors are having me do? could you explain what in suppose to do with the add code?",academics

"on-campus vs off starbucks prices hello udub reddit. i am wondering if anyone knows why starbucks prices vary so much on and off campus. for example: 

my tall (size tall) peppermint mocha from the hub starbucks is $7.48 (this price is crazy to me), but if i purchase the same drink (tall, peppermint mocha) at the ave location (off campus) the drink is only $6.01. how is there nearly $1.50 in extra fees for a drink on campus? (purchased w debit card) 

another example is the grande (size grande peppermint mocha) being $7.70 at the hub and $6.56 total on the ave??? (purchased with husky card)

i understand this may be as simple as uw collecting more money but it seems kind of ridiculous to charge so much more.

"complete guide for free (or cheap) course material going into winter quarter, a fact as old as money itself remains at uw — nobody wants to pay for something they don't have to. when looking at comically expensive textbooks, it's best to look through as many places as possible to see if you can get them for free!

this primarily covers how to get **textbook / book pdfs** but also includes a short section on **movies and tv** for classes that require watching such.

# best methods for getting free course material

1. **looking on google / reddit if someone has already asked for it!**

at large universities like uw, half the time most textbooks have already been searched for on reddit. on subreddits like r/textbookrequest (and more) individuals can receive help in their search from redditors. however, most of the time you can really just google **""\[textbook name here\] reddit""** and find a textbook pdf posted by a random redditor. i personally found my $165 spanish textbook using this method, but there are certainly other **very overpriced** uw textbooks that can be found utilizing this strategy.

2. **using an online pdf database!**

personally, i've used [https://annas-archive.org/](https://annas-archive.org/) (a comprehensive database of other pdf search sites) to find quite a bit of free pdfs for my classes — but guides such as r/freemediaheckyeah's comprehensive wiki (([linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/freemediaheckyeah/wiki/reading/#wiki_.25b7_pdf_search))) include other pdf search engines you can use! additionally, you can easily find other search tools and websites using different sub-reddits that focus on accessing free course material and literature.

*note: some books found on websites like annas-archive are provided in ""epub"" format; but you can convert epub to pdf on quite a few websites for storage on google drive. e.g:* [*https://cloudconvert.com/epub-to-pdf*](https://cloudconvert.com/epub-to-pdf)

3. **buying it used! (of course)**

this may be obvious, but buying used books (online or at the bookstore) is cheaper than buying them new. do this if you don't mind slight use and want a physical copy!

4. **using internet archive (and converting to pdf if you really want!)**

internet archive has free books that you can access and borrow! if this is the only place you can access the book for free, there's always the option of converting them to pdf so you can annotate them on google drive or preview using a pretty convoluted method that i can go into detail more about later if anyone wants to know (unfortunately it doesn't seem internet archive has an easy method to convert to pdf).

**edit: you can convert internet archive books to pdfs easily!** all you need to do is utilize this article ([article here](https://www.isolveit.xyz/2021/05/download-borrow-books-from-archiveorg.html)) which uses the software at this link ([encrypted adobe ebook to pdf software here](https://www.ebook-converter.com/drm-removal-bundle.htm)) and adobe digital editions. it has a free trial that only gives 12 book downloads, but you can probably just delete and reinstall the software if you run out (i mean i'd assume it'd reset to 12 again? probably?). so, if the book you're looking for is on internet archive (and it probably is if it's a regular book) you can use the software to convert it to pdf and get annotating! (*note: not sure how many actual textbooks are on here though*)

5. **for movies and tv for classes**

for all those needing to watch movies for a class, sometimes a teacher might suggest paying a small fee for a movie on amazon. this is certainly an option, but who wants to give more money to jeff? there are other free streaming sites shown here in a comprehensive guide: ([r/freemediaheckyeah free streaming sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/freemediaheckyeah/wiki/video/#wiki_.25ba_streaming_sites)). my personal favorite for free movies and tv is [https://moviestowatch.tv/](https://moviestowatch.tv/).

i want to apply for direct admission to comp sci, because i initially heard that if you don't get into the major, they won't reject you because of it. however, i recently heard from a current student that they have started rejecting those who do not get into comp sci so students wouldn't ""hang around waiting for something they will never get into,"" and have to go through an appeal process and change majors.

if this is the case, wouldn't it be better to decide on something that doesn't require direct admit (ex. informatics, which i would be more than willing to do) if i don't have a stellar chance at majoring in cs? i would also like to know my chances of getting into uw in general.

"why being a female is so much harder on this campus…. hi everyone. im just frustrated and needed to vent about this, but also educate my male counterparts. i’m a poc female majoring in a stem field. i’ve experienced, while at my time at uw, the constant downplaying of our observations/answers while inside of the classroom and outside. i was literally at the breaking point in one of my physics classes this week. 2 things happened in class and lab. one is that i was confused how a professor solved a certain problem, and it turns out that he had ended up solving it wrong numerically so i guess it was good i caught the mistake. my male peers, snickering behind me, also felt the need to invoice their opinions about how the professor was right etc something else too, and long story short we worked together to solve the problem. but at every stage of the problem, there was constant asking me, did you square the number to the negative power, did you do this, maybe you’re not thinking right, etc all questions they didn’t ask each other or in a very judgy way. anyways no one ended up getting to the answer. then, while in lab, my lab partner literally questions each of my lab steps in a very condescending manner. i know the difference between polite questioning and looking at someone with confused judgemental statements/eyes. i’ve been through this before, and no one should regardless of their gender or status.

i also underwent harassment and stalking by a homeless man this week who wasn’t leaving me alone until i called the police. my week has just been terrible, and it’s just so hard being a woman since we have to go through these situations in addition to trying our best to study/handle jobs. so my advice to all of the male students out there would be to be kind and work together, and stop being somewhat douch\*bag judgmental classmates, we are all at uw for a reason and have made it to our majors/academics through hardwork, regardless our gender.

"tired of living with parents semi rant, skip to 3rd paragraph if you don't really wanna read all this

some background. i'm a seattle native and live at my parents house (1hr commute via light rail to uw). it's my 2nd year at uw as a cs major (senior standing b/c running start though). i'm taking things slow and will probably graduate my 3rd year here, winter 2024, but i might as well push that to spring 2024.

so about the title, i'm tired of commuting to school and back everyday, i feel like losing 2 hours daily is not worth it anymore. i've been just passing my classes for the past year and a half now, and i don't want to go on like this until graduation. starting spring quarter i'm going to have to take 3 cse classes per quarter till graduation, as i'll have completed all my gen ed and elective credits. on top of all this, i'd like to have a decent social life and not feel like a tourist at my own school.

so my question to yall.. is it weird if i start living in dorms towards the end of my college career rather than in the beginning? maybe moving from parents house into dorms post freshmen year is more common now because of covid? i'm 19 so age difference between other residents (mostly freshmen and sophomores i'm assuming) shouldn't be too bad. if yall were in my position, would you look into housing this spring quarter, or wait until fall? also what dorm halls are the best?",student life

"doing ischool's msim program part-time? this is a follow-up to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/10jy8bn/questions_about_ischools_msim_program/):

so turns out, i applied and got accepted for the early-career track, which is expected to be full-time. in fact, the whole curriculum is designed that way, and seems to lean towards international students or students who just finished their undergrad.

i am not either of those. i have a full time job, and i read many horror stories of doing both the full-time job and full-time school. i really don't think i have the mental capacity for that sort of lifestyle.

i had an info-session with msim staffs and current students earlier today, and they told me it is not recommended to do early-career track part-time as it messes up the curriculum and the degree mapping.

now, i'd like to know if ""not recommended"" means impossible to do this. i realize this would mean a longer time to finish the course, but i'm prepared to do that if it means i get to make time management bearable. i plan on going part-time for all four quarters, which gives me around 3 years to finish.",advice
"stressed about money + commuting hi this is embarrassing but i just want to vent. i am an in-state student and have tried to do everything right in terms of finances but everything is just so expensive. at this point i'm going to graduate with at least $30k in loans and it's just so frustrating. i have a job, i've been working almost nonstop since high school, i live with my parent and commute 2.5 hours a day, i never ever eat out or buy almost anything frivolous, and i am still so broke. my parents both got laid off, i'm losing my health insurance in two months and am receiving $0 in financial aid this year.

"can’t handle more than two difficult classes per quarter… i’m an intended stats major, and while i’ve been able to get a very good gpa, i feel it has more to due with having an easier than average schedule that allows me to really take my time to absorb the material than anything else. the one quarter i took two very difficult weedouts and another moderately hard class, i almost failed one of the weedouts and had to drop down to 10 credits. the only quarter schedule i’ve been able juggle well is one where the third extracurricular requires almost no work (i mean this). however, i’m worried about the future. as i near my upperclassman years, i will no longer have the privilege to fill my schedule with “junk” credits and pretend i’m still fulfilling the areas of knowledge. i’ll have to start taking upper divs that are only 3 credits each, which means i’ll have to cram no less than four very conceptually difficult classes to be on track. i’m having a hard time imagining that i’ll be able to survive once the pace quickens. i’m not saying that i’m not capable of understanding the material well, i just can’t have too many things dividing my attention at once. is there any light at the end of the tunnel?",advice

i understand that this new technology brings challenges.  but as someone with adhd who bit off a bit more than she could chew this quarter, chatgpt has been an absolute godsend.  my side of the chat with the ai during class looks a bit like:  ""what is this term?  alright now explain at the high school level.""  ""give me a 100 word summary about this topic that the professor mentioned in the context of this other topic.""  ""write a nursery rhyme about this concept.""  ""take the topics i have been asking you about and present them back to me in the form of a data tree.""  ""i didn't understand your last answer, try reframing it.""  i feel like i have so much more control over my understanding of difficult concepts than i did before, and this gives me the opportunity to have difficult topics explained to me until i understand, no matter how long it takes.

in terms of the date, i will pay for everything. we’ll pick some place decently nice to make it worth your time. i’m thinking a non alcoholic drink of your choice and dinner. totally free in exchange for some notes about how i was to hang around. i’ve asked friends to do this for me, but the fact is, because they are my friends, they obviously have an opinion of me that is biased in my favor, otherwise they wouldn’t be friends. this is going to help me work on improving myself and my quality of life a lot more than any of you guys can realize, and i will appreciate it a ton.

to reiterate, all i am asking for you is to hang out with me and tell me how i was to be around, good and bad, in as much detail as you can, with no other expectations or strings attatched. you will get a free dinner at a place of your choosing, as well as a free non alcoholic drink like a coffee or boba. thank you in advance to anyone open to taking me up on this.",student life

"my chance of getting in? i’m currently a junior in high school, and my target university is the university of washington - seattle campus. i am an out-of-state resident, but my family will be moving to washington the summer after i graduate. this obviously won’t help with my application, though.
i’ve been looking into the school for probably almost a year now, and i sort of have my heart set on it. i definitely overthink things like this, so i’ve had it in my mind that “oh i’m worried for no reason, i’ll probably get in”. however, i have been thinking otherwise lately.
i didn’t have a good gpa my freshman year (the online year). i was in gate (basically pre-honors) classes, but had an overall gpa of 3.66. my sophomore year, i was in mostly honors classes with a 4.0 (4.33 weighted) the entire year. now, as a junior, i’m in almost all honors / aps, giving me a 3.83 (4.5 weighted) gpa for the first semester and also likely for the second. i’m predicting this same gpa for my senior year, giving me a cumulative of 3.83 and a total of 6-7 aps.
as of now, i have 0 extracurriculars. i do have reasons for this that i won’t get into, but i do plan on joining some my senior year.
i’ve taken two psats so far, and i do plan on taking the sat and the act. my scores on the psats have been an 1160 and then a 1290, giving me a projected sat score of 1340.
i have looked into it a lot- and after compiling averages online and even putting my estimated cumulative gpa and sat score into calculators, i’ve found that my chance of getting in is around a 57%. i will of course try to apply directly for my major (biochemistry), but based on my knowledge about the school, a direct admission into my major would be a miracle.
so my question here is, what do you guys think about my chances of getting in? there are probably plenty of things to consider that i haven’t taken into account, so i would like some outside / more informed opinions. is 57% too high or too low of an estimate? and it’s obvious that 57% gives me a higher chance of getting in than of not getting in, but is it not really a good enough chance? should i set my sights onto another school? i obviously plan on having safety schools, but i just feel now that it’s unlikely for me to get into uw. this is upsetting, of course, but i do still want very honest opinions on my situation.

"this is your end of quarter reminder: sometimes you'll get a shit grade, and that's okay! i'm posting this just because i had to get a whole ass pep talk from my mom last night about this. i did pretty terribly in highschool/running start and then quit community college for two years, but last spring i went back, started getting nothing but 4.0s, and applied to uw as a transfer. my first quarter was brutal but i managed to get a 4.0 gpa which meant a lot to me because the classes were all pre-reqs for the capacity constrained major i'm about to apply to. this quarter...has been brutal in a different way. i accidentally went four years without taking a math class (and i was already bad at math, i passed my last math class by like, 1-4%) and found out i'd need to take another math class before applying to my major. so much fun! unsurprisingly, even while putting in a lot of time and effort, i'm not doing great. 

it can be really, *really* frustrating to put so much time and effort into a class you're still not doing well in, and i know a lot of y'all might be feeling that frustration right now. it can feel like all the stress and work was for nothing, but i'm here to remind you that at the end of the day, it's fine. you're going to be fine! i know some classes are more important for our majors than others (my math class just needs a 2.0 or higher and doesn't factor in to my acceptance to my major) but regardless, one fucked up grade once in a while is not going to be the end of the world. even if you're looking to get into a capacity constrained major, grad school, or whatever, it's not going to ruin all of your plans and it doesn't say anything negative about you as a human being!

lots of uw students are, much like me, a bit neurotic about grades. at the end of every quarter i see posts like ""i got a 3.4 in this class, should i off myself? should i drop out and go work at mcdonald's until i wither away? should i go build a bunker in my backyard and live out my years there to avoid the humiliation of getting this grade?' and i think posts like that have potential to make people feel even worse about their actually low grades. even if you fail a class, you can retake it, you can adjust your plans, you can figure out something that'll make things work for you. it's not the end of the world and as long as you're putting the work in, that's what's meaningful and that's what's going to get you the place you want to be. i've accepted my fate and plugged the grades into canvas, and i'm finally at fucking peace with the fact that a 65% on my final will get me a 2.5, which is almost an entire grade point above my last grade in a math class. i'm fucking patting myself on the back for that, and you should pat yourself on the back for your hard work too!  


good luck on your finals friends! and even if you don't do great, it's not the end of the world. your efforts aren't going to go unrewarded forever, and it's an accomplishment in itself to keep yourself afloat in college. much love!!!",advice

"hfs staffing explained hello all! i've seen a lot of posts asking about the staffing problems with on-campus dining lately and i did a bit of inside research on the subject. here is what i gathered:

as many forum posts have claimed before, the union requires that hfs fill a certain number of full-time positions before giving hours to students. this is where the staffing issue comes from. there are more than enough students, but the pay that hfs offers for ft is too low to keep these positions staffed, and the school is not allowed to supplement them with pt.

tl;dr: yes, this is true.

background: currently, i work at a restaurant making almost double the base salary for retail lead at an hfs position (so in theory i have plenty of bargaining power). more specifics about their retail lead position: it is a required 40 hrs/week with no schedule flexibility, pretty basic (bare minimum imo) benefits, you don't get to choose which location (even from the ones hiring, although they do take preferences into account). at least compared to my current job, none of this is very appealing. i applied for this retail lead position to check it out and received my offer a few months ago.

starting salary is $3,260 - $3,665 ($21.14/hr) for the rl job. the starting pay for new hires (not leads, just team members) including tips at my current job is $23.75, plus schedule and location flexibility and similar benefits. i was offered the upper end of the pay scale. when i explained to hfs that this rate isn't competitive, they told me the wfse union establishes these rates and that is the highest they are allowed to offer. i then called the wfse union to confirm and the rep told me yes, unless the school is having, and i quote, ""trouble hiring people,"" they are required to only offer pay within this range. no lower, but also no higher.

so, i have no idea how the school wedged themselves into an agreement where they can't offer anything higher than a certain rate. unions are supposed to benefit employees and so it seems like somebody in this situation is being predatory to have a pay cap like this (just my theory!). however, from the representative's ""trouble hiring people"" comment, it seems to me that either hfs has not gotten the message or has not communicated the message that their students do indeed feel like they are having trouble hiring people to stay staffed.

the only thing i can think of is if everyone keep complaining! on days when half of the restaurants are closed, or when you go to the hub an hour too late to get food, make a stink about it. raise your voice (not literally at the employees duh), send hfs an email or something, i don't know.",student life

"msim 12 month eca track for sdes? i am currently an sde at microsoft, and i got admission into the msim early career accelerated track. i am looking to continue into sde roles (preferably sde2) after graduation, and i love so many things about udub. 

what’s making it hard to finalise this choice are the following 3 reasons.

1) i know thar the program is meant for data and information professionals. i have seen few people go for sde roles after this program, but want to know if it would be a very difficult path to take. for more context, i will have 3 years of work exp as an sde when i start my masters.

2) the current job market isn’t that great, so a little worried about how the situation will be in 16 months from now, which will be the time when i’ll graduate.

3) i got 2 more admits in cmu, in their mse and mism programs. but they are too expensive for me, and udub’s msim courses interested me more. having a very hard time to make a choice.

ultimately, my goal is to learn anything new related to the tech field, need not be completely technical, and land an sde role. can anyone from the program give some insights about the possibility for the above?",advice

received admits/offers for ms information systems program offered by foster school at uw seattle campus and the ms business analytics program by milgard school at uw tacoma.

"phys 121: purchasing e text &amp; access code to mylab &amp; mastering (💀 why are there so many options…? i’m confused 💀)

so according to the [physics 12x website](https://phys.washington.edu/121-122-123-courses), there are five options to purchase the etext and/or the access code. the access duration for online learning system varies from 18 weeks to 18 months.

this information completely differs from the payment screen on pearson. 

there are three options on the payment screen:
- option a: with e-text access with access to mastering (18 weeks) - $74.99
- option b: with e-text access with access to mastering (up to 24 months (???) ) - $124.99
- option c: without e-text access (up to 24 months (???) ) but with access to mastering - $79.99

the “up to 24 months” confuses the hell out of me because the physics 12x series website says that the access duration is 18 months… (but i digress)

i plan on taking physics 121 in the spring quarter (which is now) and physics 122 in winter quarter 2024 (which is… later (lol) ).

essentially, would i be okay in buying option c when i have a pdf copy of the textbook? i’m confused because the options only say “access to mastering” so would this include mylab and mastering??? is access to mastering referring to the hw??? will i be okay without the etext? 

i just need the cheapest version for the longest amount of time possible that covers what i need to submit for the course—mylab and mastering, and the physics 12x website info (as linked above) is confusing the hell out of me.",academics

"honest uwb to uws chances. 
hey guys,

ik there are already a few posts abt transferring from uw bothell to seattle. but i just wanted some input from y’all.

so a lil background: im currently a freshman at uwb(sophomore credit-wise), and am currently working towards completing my prereqs for computer engineering. im really interested in informatics at seattle, specifically the data science stream. this is because of a couple of reasons: 
1. ive taken a couple of data science courses(outside school) that have rlly interested me in the field. i also plan on doing some small projects in the mere future.
2. the campus and college life, or rather the absence of it at uwb.
3. ive just started taking a class at seattle(cross-campus) and i love it✅

by the time i apply (sep 2023) my gpa should be around a 3.75 and i would about 70ish credits as im also taking summer classes. i kinda am already done with info prereqs too.

please lmk what y’all think abt my honest chances of transferring 👍, and if y’all have suggestions.",admissions

i got accepted for pre-sciences with the intent to major in biology my junior year. at ucsd i got accepted for molecular and cell biology at marshall.

"i got into uws (as a pre-science student) and uwb (as a pre-major student), and i want to go into cs. what should i do? with may just around the corner, i am a little concerned about the decision i'm making.

i really want to go into computer science, but, since i've been rejected from uws's cs school, i'm also considering informatics as a backup major. however, i've also been offered admission to uwb, where the cs major does not look as crazy competitive due to the smaller campus size. plus, i've already completed multiple of the prerequisites, so i might even be able to graduate early if i get into the program.

i don't know if i should struggle over informatics (which has a barely similar set of prerequisites) when i would rather go into cs. i would pick uwb immediately, but my only issue then is whether or not one program is valued over the other, and whether it would be worth pursuing a still very competitive major in something i'm not as interested in for another major in a different campus that could potentially affect my resume.

putting it all into words, my issue here is a lot more personal and complex than i thought, so let me whittle it down to this: is working for more time to attempt to get into uws's ischool (informatics program) worth more than potentially taking less time to attempt to get into uwb's csse? does it matter at all? i should probably also note that i am most definitely going to be doing stuff outside of school to help my resume.

follow up question: would staying in uws for one quarter, and then transferring to uwb if i want, be a better idea? i suppose i'm confused on where to enter into initially.

"why you might be lonely at uw hi all,

there seems to be a substantial population of lonely people here, and i wanted to give a few reasons as to why that might be.

1. quarter system. people are busy, and it's a nonstop barrage of exams and assignments. on top of caring about grades, everyone around you is trying to pile on extracurriculars. there is a relatively high turnover of new people that you will meet between classes.
2. it's a big school. you have to put in more effort to meet up with somebody, and it's easier to avoid someone or get lost in the crowd.
3. cliques. uw has a few surrounding feeder schools and california students, so people stick to what they know.
4. you're in a major with a higher workload. related to point 1, but if you're doing labs all day it can be harder to find someone you like.

i left out the freeze because it depends on who you talk to, but people around here are friendly. this isn't to say that there are some things that you as an individual can't improve, but i would consider the above to be decent obstacles to making friends. there are folks that do like you for you.

fpv drone racing is a competitive sport where drone pilots wear ar-goggles to race drones from a first-person perspective. these racing drones can go upwards of 60 miles per hour! racing courses consist of a series of obstacles that the drone must navigate through, with the pilot having the fastest lap time winning. we encourage our pilots to use the drone simulators in clark hall whenever they want. outside of racing, our drone team will provide many opportunities for **developing your skills in engineering (nice for your resume**). assembly of drones requires detailed soldering, testing, and shop skills.

&#x200b;

🛠️ aircraft build: in case you also did not know, our club is building the **very first light sport aircraft** on campus (rv-12is)! this is an extremely unique and lucrative project to be involved in and looks great on a resume to practically any engineering-involved company, especially boeing! while this opportunity is full for the quarter, this summer we will still be working on it and planning our projects for this year. all huskies are welcomed into our space at the mech e building during this time!

&#x200b;

🏫 free ground school: mondays on our discord server feature virtual lessons taught by a certified cfi. these lessons, sponsored by emerald squadron aviation llc, are free in our club so long as you are a husky student and have a discord account. if you consistently do well enough in the course, our cfi will sponsor you to take the written knowledge test. this is huge towards gaining your private or recreational pilot's license, considering such lessons are typically hundreds of dollars at local flight schools.

outside of our drone racing team and flight simulators, husky flying club places a big emphasis on **building connections between our members and people in the aviation industry.**  our club holds “aviation talks”, social qna sessions where we bring  people from the aviation industry such as pilots or engineers to talk to  our members. in addition, we are working toward getting our members who  have zero flight experience some time in the air with actual pilots from the local civil air patrol.

"this sub desperately needs to restrict certain posts to topic-specific mega threads i feel like 50% of this sub is just posts asking the sliiiightest iterations of the same few questions, those questions being:

1. will i get accepted?
2. what are my chances of getting accepted?
3. will my offer get rescinded?
4. is (some area around uw) safe?

the answers are the same most of the time, and it seems like people don’t look at previously asked questions before posting. i know it’s kind of a petty complaint, but it’s annoying as hell! i feel like this sub would benefit from posts with those questions not being allowed outside a specific megathread. that way people are also forced to see other peoples questions and the answers they’ve gotten and might not even need to post their question after all. 

anyway, if that doesn’t happen and you have one of the questions above, here are the formal answers 

1. maybe!
2. the acceptance rate of the school!
3. probably not! unless you murdered someone or didn’t actually graduate highschool or something, and if that’s the case, you have a bigger problem on your hands!
4. nowhere in seattle is safe because i am here and i will track you down and steal all your electronics so there’s one less person asking these questions!

at the end of last quarter, i met with my  academic advisor who told me that if i took only 10 credits this spring quarter, my financial aid would be fine because i’d still be completing 36 credits over the whole academic year. well, turns out she has no fuckin idea what she’s talking about, because at the beginning of this quarter, my financial aid did not disburse because i wasn’t registered for at least 12 credits. i told the financial aid office what my advisor said, and they were like yeah no that’s not how it works. so i added a random 3-credit envh class that i haven’t gone to once. 

at the same meeting (which was during week 9 of winter quarter), my advisor told me to drop a 3-credit class i was definitely going to get an ns in (long story but i promise i’m not just lazy). again, she said it would be be fine because i’d still be completing 36 credits over the whole year. so i dropped it in week 9 and thus fell to 10 credits. again, turns out she’s dead wrong, but i never heard anything about it from the financial aid office.    

so my current dilemma - i really really need to drop this envh class. but i’m worried that i just got lucky last quarter or that they haven’t noticed yet, and that if i drop below 12 credits again i’ll have to repay my financial aid or something. 

does anyone know anything about any of this? if you drop below 12 credits at the end of the quarter, do they not care? any advice would be a huge help. thank you :)",advice

"info/business double degree -- is it doable? incoming uw student here, admitted directly to info for fall 2023. i have yet to talk to an academic advisor, but i just wanted to hear fellow students (or alumni) thoughts on achieving a double degree in informatics and business.

also, here is some quick information to avoid more generic answers:

* 10 ap classes, intending to use probably 5 to fulfill mostly ssc and nsc requirements and stay as close to 225-230 credits as possible by graduation.
* i would absolutely love to do summer abroad, but i'm not sure when.
* no running start credit :-(
* interested in getting an mba, although plans can always change down the road!

i made a spreadsheet for myself showing every class i need to take to get both degrees at the same time after four years at the uw. after spending a couple of hours simulating a couple of schedules, i found the most financial-savvy way to do both degrees is by doing 18 credits most quarters plus a summer quarter to stay afloat, which i know would be exhausting and stressful.

i like to consider myself hardworking and excited about learning, but i want to avoid a declining mental health and overworking myself to burnout. i am thinking of knocking out a couple of prereqs for business this summer and possibly doing a summer quarter 2024 (so that i can apply for winter quarter 2025 during my sophomore year) to ease the burden, but do you guys have any other thoughts on how achievable this double degree is?",academics

i will say - the apartment complex is here seattle, which, if you've heard anything about, is rather notorious for its shitty management. having lived here for about a year, i'll say that most of the general qualms with the complex aren't actually about the apartment (which, to be honest, is pretty damn nice), but more about the management's delay of the apartment opening (our move-in was delayed by, like, 3 months). so, if you're subleasing, you don't have to deal with any of that shit, and you just get to move into the apartment on time like a normal person lol. also, to be so honest, management right now is pretty chill. i think most of the front desk workers are uw students, and they never check on your apartment. so, not bad. the apartment itself is very nice (our kitchen has massive counterspace lol).

anyways, message me if you're interested and/or want pictures! like i said, i'm personally willing to negotiate the rent price, because frankly, paying less on my rent in an apartment i won't be in over the summer is better than paying the full rent. also willing to tour for those in the area, or record a video tour for interested parties, so just lmk!",student life

"reflection from a jaded senior (gatekeeping culture at uw) because every facet of uw is competitive (major admissions, internships, jobs), most students gatekeep their resources and misrepresent their stats. i’ve often seen fellow students and even friends gatekeep their network, internships, resources. as a result, it’s extremely hard for someone without network to even know where to begin looking for internships and get their foot in the door. i especially feel this as a first gen immigrant, as my parents can only nod and smile when i tell them about school or my internship. as much as people don’t want to believe it or laugh at it, but privilege also comes from having well connected parents (or even parents who know about how the american society works). this is where i sound cynical, but it really is true when people joke that someone can make a call to their dad or their dads friend and get an internship. i saw a video where there is soft nepotism (or something along those lines), where young people benefit from having parents in the same industry as them. i see my peers having their hands held through the recruiting process because they have parents in that industry. 

looking back, i want to stress the importance of network to incoming students. resources are distributed widely in professional rsos and frats/sororities (which also require quite competitive applications but that’s another can of worms) but tightly restricted within those social circles, so make sure you are leveraging these networks.

edit: this post exists to reflect on my experiences and offer a word of advice to younger students. yes, this was my dream school, but because of that i came in with rose tinted glass thinking that as long as i do well (get into a good major, get good grades, get into good clubs) i will be recognized by the real world and be rewarded with a good job. however, i was unaware of the fact that networking is such an important factor in addition to doing well academically, and sometimes even trumps academic achievement. for those that have had similar experiences, i feel seen and i am glad we can all recognize the bigger issue. yet i want to make it clear that i am not looking for sympathy, but to offer perspectives that i wish someone would have told me coming into college. i write this post partially to also let younger students know that academic achievement isn’t all and it’s better to start building connections, especially if they didn’t realize that network is important or what networking even is (as i was when i started college). 

secondly, i admit that yes, i perhaps could’ve done better and shot for the stars. i am not giving myself any excuses, as many in the comments think i am doing. this isn’t a pity party, and i am not blaming other hardworking people for “taking things away from me”. my criticism is on the system where some people who have low, no experience, etc, can get a job because their parents have connection.

lastly, some comments seem to rely on confirmation bias when evaluating the information in this post. more dangerously, making assumptions in the name of “tough love”. just because i shed light on some less-than-peachy aspects of uw does not mean i have no connections or relationships. i have a job, friends, and i am full of hope. i am simply recognizing the fact that to get here, it took me a lot of extra work.",advice

hi guys! it has been a month since i last posted here, and i was overwhelmed by the personal experience, support, and advices i got from current uw students. you guys were all brutally honest about your experience, and i just want to say thank you, i genuinely appreciate each and every comment on that post.

today, saturday, may 27th, 2023, i have decided to decline uw pre-science offer and committed to my local community college, and will test my luck again with the uw cs transfer admission cycle.

as a lot of you have said, the true ""college experience"" is what you make it to be. i might be missing out on the ""traditional college experience"", the freshmen dorming experience, the parties, the late night studies at odegaard, the walks with friends on uw red square, etc, but i'm sure that i will gain a lot of meaningful experience at my local cc!

for the anxious high school students that are reading this, there is no right or wrong option, college admission is random sometimes (i'm an instate student waitlisted by uw but accepted by ucla, ga tech, uiuc and just got off uc berkeley waitlist). don't be disheartened by setbacks or waitlists; sometimes, life has a way of working things out in unexpected ways.

as for now, uw is still at the top of my transfer list and i hope that my journey at the community college will be fruitful and lead me back to uw in the future.

good luck to all the prospective, current, and graduated uw students, and to anyone navigating the college admissions process. i hope my story can provide some guidance and reassurance to others facing a similar dilemma. may your journeys be filled with growth, learning, and success.",advice

the problem is, without financial aid i will not be able to attend without financial aid. since almost every freshman going to uw already confirmed their admission, do you think i have any chance of getting “good” financial aid? is it even worth it to contact the office?

my other problem is that for some reason i got marked as an out of state applicant even though i live in washington, which means higher tuition, which means i also need more financial aid. 

i was already planning on going to community college, so if i end up having to do that because of the cost/being marked as out of state i wouldn’t be so mad but would i even be able to get in again if i decide to go to community college instead of uw? would i get “blacklisted” if i reject my admission? also, does anyone know if i can transfer after just one year or do i have to do two years of cc before transferring?

"want to transfer to uw from bellevue college hey guys, so i'm currently a bellevue college student and i am interested in applying to uw for the nutritional sciences program (food systems major). at the end of this quarter i will have my 90 credits (and technically an aa-dta), i have a 4.0 gpa, am in the ptk honors society, and am president of a new club. i have also held a part-time job for the past 2 years during cc (one year was running start). however i have 3 more classes (minimum) that i'd have to take to be able to apply for the major due to this not being my original plan when starting cc, so my planning wasn't perfect, which i plan on taking during bc's fall quarter. this means i'd plan to transfer to uw starting in the winter quarter. i'm mostly wondering about my chances of getting accepted to uw assuming i maintain all of the previously mentioned things during the fall quarter (although the deadline to apply for winter is actually before bc fall quarter starts so i don't know if that would even matter). do you think i'd need more extracurriculars? some options i could look into for those are tutoring at bc or applying to the school newspaper to potentially write nutrition related articles, volunteering at food banks, etc. but i've seen some people say extracurriculars weren't really important. i've also gathered that the personal essay is one of the most important things. and i know that uw really likes cc transfer students from in state so that would probably make my chances higher. just wondering what my chances are.

i also met with an advisor from the school of public health today as well and she mentioned that the food systems major is also a minimum requirement major and that if i met the minimum requirements that i would pretty much be guaranteed to get into the major. i've seen some other people talking about how they got accepted into the specific school/major before they actually got accepted into uw (general admission i guess(?)). so i'm wondering if that is something you can do? i'm not entirely sure i understand all that lol

another thing is that depending on if i choose to take one bio class fall quarter or the entire gen bio series at bc (which would take another year), either of those paths would transfer to give me the 5 credits needed for the major at uw, it just depends on what would be best for my goals after graduation, and i'm speaking with a nutrition advisor soon to figure out what bio path would be best. basically i'd either transfer for the next winter quarter, or if i take more bio classes i'd transfer to the autumn quarter of 2024. waiting another year and taking more bio classes could give me a chance to get more extracurriculars however i've also heard that uw doesn't like it when you take more than 2 years to complete an associates (but i already have my associates so maybe it's ok?), and then just taking the one bio class and applying for winter quarter would be nice because its sooner, but then everything is a bit tighter. looking for opinions on that stuff i guess.

greetings. i really hope that you could read my following words and consider them carefully, as it is absolutely something that directly pours out of a student who is now working desperately hard to get to uw and start his academic journey. as previously mentioned, my background is very different from most other students from uw and it could be something that affects my visa application. i applied for a student visa in beijing, china today but unfortunately got rejected. i discussed the situation on my visa application form(ds160) about how i tried to overcome the bullying issues, which were seriously hindering my education and have cost me several years out of school, creating a gap in my education. but it seems that the visa officer did not read it in full detail at all(maybe because it was kind of long) and did not acknowledge my situation. it is likely that they only thought about the fact that i am older than other ordinary students and just rejected me, assuming that i have ***immigration intent*** because i am attending college at my current age. they may have concerns that i would overstay/work illegally once i got the visa.

but it is not the truth, bullying is nothing that should be considered my fault and i suffered a lot from the situation. i have seen quite a lot of people with similar situations never be able to rise up from the abyss where they were struggling. but god knows how i managed to overcome those exceedingly insurmountable obstacles and managed to come back from that. i think it is the innate determination that has pushed me finally to this stage of life. it is funny that the bullies and everyone else from my previous school here in china never made it to uw or other similarly prestigious universities. 

after i was forced out of school because of these incidents, i almost never ceased learning everything i had at hand. i have been so desperately working hard to absorb every bit of knowledge that i have in my sight. i have come back from that abyss where a significant number of people were crashed, hammered, and scattered in pieces and i do not want this to affect my hard-earned opportunities anymore. i want to go to uw without being accused of having immigration intent and being older than other students. i hope everything i worked up will eventually pay off for me and i know i am well worth it. i promise i will work hard amongst the top determined students you have ever seen in your career and i hope i can have a chance to make you and uw proud! i have come back from a student who did not know how to cope when forced out of a chinese middle school to someone that finds his way to finish four years of u.s. high school in one year and successfully send himself to college. i want to keep being a miracle worker! i love uw and desperately want to come!

sincerely, may i please have some assistance regarding my visa application from uw? today, i was rejected by an officer in the u.s. embassy in beijing, likely due to my previous visa rejections when going to a community college(i wanted to transfer to a 4-year university from a cc first) and the fact i am older than other undergraduate college students, which means i am 26 years old now. could you please offer me some guidance and assistance regarding my unique situation? i really want to nail this visa application and successfully come to uw. any help would be highly appreciated!",advice

"uw vs. uo? i hate to be redundant with all of the other ""why udub?"" posts, but i'm beginning to reach a level of indecisiveness that i'm desperate. i just got off of the waitlist for the university of washington—seattle last saturday, so i'm checking out the campus for a second time before i make the final decision by june 10.

uw was my top, top choice when i was applying to colleges originally, but once i was waitlisted, i had to accept that my admission was not guaranteed and opt for something else... after lots of comparing and contrasting, i fell in love with the uo. i was admitted into their honor's college, and the marching band was a definite. housing is guaranteed with a good system for connecting with potential roommates, so it feels like i've got everything in place over there. however, while the marching band and the honors program are no longer guaranteed at uw, i know that the school has a prestige that may be kind of stupid for me to pass up. i'll be a psychology undergrad, but i still feel like the rigor and quality of education are important to me. i'm also from nyc, so seattle's more urban environment that is meant to accommodate a big city rather than just college students feels more familiar than eugene.

the costs of both schools are pretty comparable, as i'll be paying out-of-state tuition for both. when i look for honest opinions online, i solely see overwhelmingly positive or drastically negative responses. i realize that i'm asking one of the uo's top athletic rivals, but i'm just waiting to sign the dotted line and am curious about others' opinions.",advice

"best way to attract and vet a house\pet sitter on campus? to be clear, i want to hire a uw student because i am a grad student and the times that i will need a sitter will line up with the school’s breaks, but the house is in redmond, not on campus. we’ve tried rover, but we’re unable to reliably get the same sitter over and over.

my questions:

* is there an official or unofficial forum somewhere to hire students?

* short of a background check, are there reasonable ways to vet a student?

* is it reasonable to ask for a character reference from a staff or faculty member, with the student’s consent?

edit: since it seems like this might generate some leads, here are a few more details.

* 2 dogs 20lb dogs, one is not the best behaved and needs someone with a “dog voice” and experience with dogs

* we’re looking for xmas and spring break for the next 2 years and maybe some other times depending on availability

* if the sitter doesn’t have a vehicle, i can provide one while they house sit, given that they have a valid u.s. drivers license and it clears with my car insurance company",advice

anyway i’m not asking for pity, i did other things with my time although that i don’t regret. i am asking for advice though - where should i go from here? i’d love to do, well, anything but i just feel remarkably down bad - especially since my grades aren’t amazing either.

"on-campus vs. off-campus housing for the following year? i've lived in both dorms and on-campus apartments in the past year, and i have been planning to stay in an off-campus apartment (the accolade) for the upcoming 2023-2024 school year that is very close to some of the dorms and has a good reputation. however, over the last few days, i have debated whether to stay in this apartment or opt in and stay in the dorms.

&#x200b;

i know that for sure, if i wanted a dorm, then i would prefer either a double room or a single room in any of the modern dorms (alder, lander, maple, poplar, elm, terry, oak, willow, madrona, mccarty), with a strong preference in willow or terry (only because i have friends living in those halls next year as residents and ras). however, if i get a roommate, it will likely become a random roommate, and i am not sure how exactly things will play out in that scenario. when i was staying with hfs this past year, i had two scenarios where i was with two random roommates for about three weeks in a triple dorm (alder) and then with one preferred and two random roommates for the next nine months in an on-campus apartment (mercer court). i would have my own bedroom in my off-campus apartment but would be sharing a living space with two preferred roommates and one random roommate.

&#x200b;

now, i know i can manage and make do with a dorm scenario. i will be on the lookout for roommates if that's what i end up with, but the main reason why i would be looking to stay on campus is because of the amount of space i could have in a dorm room versus the amount of space i could have in the bedroom of my off-campus apartment. i plan to bring a couple of instruments with me this coming year since i am a musician, and i am worried that i will not have any space to keep them if i stay off-campus in my bedroom compared to the space i could have for it in the dorms. i obviously would also like to have some space for working (desk space) and some storage since i am out of state and will have some boxes and suitcases with all my other stuff.

&#x200b;

"needing some suggestions that can help me finally make it to uw... hello, fellow uw students. first, congratulations to those who just graduated this year! well done, and hope everything can go well in whatever lies ahead in your future. and i hope that everybody who just finished their finals is doing great. have a wonderful summer vacation.

as for me, i really hope that i can receive some advice about my coping strategies during my visa interview. as mentioned in my previous post, i encountered school bullying in my country over 10 years ago. i got seriously affected by that so there basically was no means for me to carry on my study in my middle school then. 

luckily, through my resilience and determination along the path, over time i gradually recovered from that situation and made it to colleges, in a country that is considered foreign to me. so basically i succeeded in making it through, although i basically have to teach myself everything to prepare myself for college, after i was out of that middle school in my country. 

but as my education took a huge hit from the incident, it was significantly delayed and i had to face going to school at a relatively older age, like i had to do it when i am 26. this is gonna be a huge con when applying for a student visa, they suspect you will misuse your visa for immigration or sth illegal. 

i know that i need to explain everything in the interview(i have been rejected once). i really hope that maybe you guys can provide me with some feedback about my interview strategy, it is gonna be so helpful and i wanna see if my words are concise and persuasive enough. i posted my strategy in the comment.

"study abroad — s/ns? just looking for some additional perspectives! i’m a ling major studying abroad right now and one of my classes is looking pretty rough. it’s not directly related to my major, but there are definitely some connections between ling and this class (cognitive neuroscience), so i’m worried about how my grade will affect things like future grad school admissions. the only problem is that i don’t actually have any idea what my grade is in this class :( the teacher has posted some individual grades, but nothing’s actually been entered into the system here. i think i have a low b/high c.

the final is tomorrow so, according to uw’s exchange credit policies, i should still be able to request s/ns immediately after taking the test and seeing how i feel. i can’t imagine my final grade will be anything at or above a 3.0, though, and my current uw gpa (including the other classes i’ve taken on exchange) is a flat 4.0, so it’s going to make a big difference. i was just wondering if anyone had any opinions! a 2.0 is totally possible here, but so is maybe a 2.7. an s just seems to read like a low-effort 2.0, so i’m scared it’ll look even worse. would appreciate y’all’s input! thanks :)",advice

is anyone in this subreddit able to speak to their experience as a student in either of these programs? are my fears overblown? tell me if so. i love research, i know what interests me, but i'm a first-gen nontraditional student who's worked too hard to get to a place of happiness and stability in life. i feel i'd be a fish out of water pursuing my interests that far.

thanks in advance for literally any experience shared, good or bad. i've been agonizing over this decision too long. ",discussion
"nursing major help i am currently a highschool senior in washington, not seattle though. i am a pan caucasian female (idk if that changes anything) i also attend running start at eastern washington university, i have a 3.9 gpa there and a 4.0 at my high school. i would really like to go to udub, but i’m going into nursing. and everything i have heard about nursing has been that it’s extremely rigorous application process, barely any people get in, and many people never get in. so with that, i feel very discouraged about my chances of getting in. i won’t have all my prerequisites done by the time i graduate, so i was planning to apply and (if i get in) finish them there and maybe i get into the actual nursing program. i also took honors classes my first two hs years. what i’m worried about is the fact that i don’t have many extracurriculars that usually make a student look amazing. i stopped doing sports with covid and never really started back up because i started working. and with working, and running start full time (1.5 hour commute each way as well), i didn’t have time to really get involved in anything. i have volunteered at a river cleanup a while ago but i don’t know if i can verify the hours or anything. i go to the gym regularly and used to box for about a year, but those are outside of school and they don’t look that great. during the summer i help out with my family’s small business full time, so i don’t have time for a passion project. as well, i don’t think i will qualify for much financial aid, even though my family is low income, because you have to count the business’s value, so i can’t really afford to go to a private school (i will have to take out loans even for udub). however, i really want to be in seattle, and i really just wanted to know if anyone thinks i could make it into the program, or even the school, or if anyone has advice :)",advice

my husband and i are trying to decide what to do when we start going to grad school at uw. we want to live closer to campus. i've heard it's hard to get family housing on campus but what's your experience? 

so far we have considered the following options:

· selling our home and buying something closer to campus
· renting out our home with any combination of the below options
· student housing
· renting
· sub leasing

we currently live in kirkland and the drive has gotten crazy. plus i am disabled and being able to take the bus or ride a scooter to classes will be a huge plus. i hate having to deal with parking and then parking being so far away! on top of it being expensive. 

we love our house in kirkland because it has a backyard. we are kind of leaning towards renting our house out to someone we know but then renting near campus will be just an extra expense. plus i am very sentimental about the house now as my cat was just diagnosed with cancer.  🥺 she's made her mark (literally) on the house. and we bought a house with a backyard specifically so our cats can hang out with us while we garden.

"math 124 or 125? i'm an incoming freshman in the college of engineering (engineering undeclared) and i plan to major in a&a. i did the ib diploma program and got credits for math 124. the ib required us to use a scientific graphing calculator (i used casio fx-cg50) but the math 124/125 website says that we can only use ti-30x iis for the course - a calculator i'm not very well acquainted with. it also says that it's recommended for students to retake the class, regardless of whether they have ap/ib credits. 

my question is - should i skip math 124? i took the math 124 placement test and scored 9/10 (which makes me qualified for the class) + i scored a 7 in math aa hl in ib. i also looked over the math 124 and 125 syllabus and i'd say i've covered around 90% of the stuff in high school (for both classes). although, i'm still a bit worried because 1) the calculator's different and i'm not sure how much of an emphasis is placed on its usage in the class, 2) they're both weed-out classes and i'm not sure if choosing math 125 without having studied 124 would be a good decision (especially in my first quarter), and 3) i'm planning on taking chem 142, engl 121, gen st 199/engr 101 along with math 124/125 and i want to maintain a high gpa for most classes since they're prerequisites for my intended major.

now before i do, i wanted to ask a few questions about the apartment i'd be moving into and stuff related to that. i've never lived alone before, or in a central us city, so pardon me if any of my questions are dumb or anything lol.

first, how is it like living in nordheim court? is it quiet-ish? is there anything i should know/be wary of before moving in? 

also, i know the walk to campus is kinda uphill, but how bad is it? if i want to catch a bus that isn't full, what time should i aim to leave? 

how safe is the area around the apartment? are there any times where i could be out alone for a walk, for example, (as an *extremely* tiny 5 foot 100 lb woman)? should i bring mace/pepper spray/a taser just in case (i know i'll likely never need it but i think it'd make me feel safer anyway). 

next, how many cheap food+grocery options are there nearby lmao, it seems like everything good is on the ave 😭. does anyone go to costco from campus? is it an easy/quick bus ride without lots of changes? and are there any east asian household item stores nearby (like daiso/miniso/others)? 

what about travel from the airport? i see most people take the lightrail, but is it easy with luggage? especially if you have at least 2 suitcases? 

lastly, what are the most important things i should bring before moving onto campus, vs stuff i can buy later? my current list is: 

bed sets (idk if it should be twin xl or full but i'll see), pillows, basic toiletries, towels + washcloths, dishes and cutlery (like a pair of everything), clothes ofc, an umbrella(?), clothing iron?? some small pots and pans, some spices and rice and ramen, maybe an airfryer/toaster??? idk this feels like a lot but i'm also worried i'm missing stuff too.

"chem sequences for pre-nursing hi! i’m an incoming freshman with a pre-nursing major.

i tested into chem 145 but read for bsn prereqs that chem 120/220/221 is the best for pre-nursing students. 

i emailed the nursing admissions team and they said i could take 152 after 145 and also an ochem course. dug around, found that ochem 237 appeared the best fit for taking chem 145, but the pre-reqs for it are chem 153/155/162.  

i emailed asking if i could take general chemistry 145+155 + ochem 237 to complete my chemistry pre-reqs. (haven’t gotten a response yet.)

"aa engineering undergrad to physics phd i've really liked being an aa undergrad, but from the time i've gotten to spend working in industry as an intern, i've realized that i'm not going to be happy if the rest of my career is nothing but excel engineering and mind numbing webex meetings. what i really wanted to do with my career before realizing it was a financial non-starter was to be a physicist (hopefully going the astrophysics/particle physics route). i love space though, so aerospace seemed like the next best thing, especially if i got to do more hands-on work (which hasn't been the case so far). i keep finding myself looking at all of the great classes in the physics department on myplan though, and it's gotten a bit depressing realizing i won't be able to take them going into my last year of undergrad. i'd do a master's, but most of the time uw will not cover costs, and i'd have a hard time affording it on my own (parents only paying 1/2 of 3 years of undergrad). has anyone here had any experience with applying to a graduate physics program after completing an engineering bachelor's?",academics

"uw materials science vs cu boulder aerospace  hello,

i'm reaching out on here in hopes that someone would be able to guide me and help me make a decision. i was admitted into uw's materials science program (my home state) but rejected from their aerospace program and received my admission into boulder's aerospace program a bit ago.

for some background, i have always wanted to go into the aerospace field since i was young. i've received internship offers with boeing, interned at an og aerospace company, and had been involved in my school's rocketry team. i want to pursue a career in electric propulsion systems and eventually want to get a graduate degree.

i have financial aid for uw since i was a previous student and had some scholarships racked up. i'm taking a materials science class as a prerequisite right now and am not a huge fan. if i decide to commit to cu boulder, that would mean leaving my family here and having to move in less than a month.

i guess i'm just stuck with my 2 options:

1. uw materials science

pros: in-state, decent financial aid, close to family and friends, minor in aerospace

cons: not the major i ideally want, worried about lack of access to opportunities post-grad

2) cu boulder aerospace

pros: major that interests me, no worry about the types of post-grad opportunities

"moving into an apartment (nordheim court) for the first time, what essentials should i make sure to have when i move? hello! so i'm a master's student looking to move into nordheim this fall, if all goes well. 

now before i do, i wanted to ask a few questions about the apartment i'd be moving into and stuff related to that. i've never lived alone before, or in a central us city, so pardon me if any of my questions are dumb or anything lol.

so first, what are the most important things i should bring before moving onto campus, vs stuff i can buy later? my current list is: 

bed sets (idk if it should be twin xl or full but i'll see), pillows, basic toiletries, towels + washcloths, dishes and cutlery (like a pair of everything), clothes ofc, an umbrella(?), clothing iron?? some small pots and pans, some spices and rice and ramen, maybe an airfryer/toaster??? idk this feels like a lot but i'm also worried i'm missing stuff too.

also, do the apartments come with kettles at least, or literally anything else i can leave out? i'm already spending a lot to get a whole new wardrobe to move into a cold and rainy climate, along with all the other stuff, so i kinda want to keep it at a minimum cost 😭

ooh also, where do people get good rain coats/shoes that maybe don't cost over $100-$150 per piece? the cheaper the better tbh, but anything that works and can last a year is good!

next, how many cheap food+grocery options are there nearby lmao, it seems like everything good is on the ave 😭. does anyone go to costco from campus? is it worth it to go that far on public transport? and since i'm south asian, do the grocery stores hold any south asian food items (or are there any indian/pakistani stores nearby)? 

what about travel from the airport? i see most people take the lightrail, but is it easy with luggage? especially if you have at least 2 suitcases? 

and lastly, side question(s), how is it like living in nordheim court? is it quiet-ish? is there anything i should know/be wary of before moving in? and i've read the walk to campus is kinda uphill, but how bad is it? if i want to catch a bus that isn't full, what time should i aim to leave?

sorry for the super long post, feel free to leave out as many questions as you want. thanks for reading this thoughhhh!! (also my post gets deleted every time i try to post it here but hopefully it won't this time 😭)",advice

in my 1st year i took only 1 intro class per quarter (bio 18o + chem 142 and 152) and i developed a pretty good study strategy that helped me get a 4.0 on all my classes. for example doing a dummy load of practice problems to really get the concepts done. i looked at some practice exams for bio and phys and i feel like it might be manageable if i do the same routine of doing more practice exams than memorization.

"sick and tired of the lack of communication from the japanese department, need advice 
currently stuck in a limbo where i have been waiting for two months for the japanese instructor to get back to me. i have emailed four times (decided to limit myself in fear of being entitled) already yet they have not responded to me. i get that it’s summer, but it’s one thing to respond to the email of other students while choosing to deliberately ignore mine. eventually, i asked the academic advisors for assistance and they intervened, although the professor still has not made contact.

what makes this extremely disheartening is that japanese 101 is currently full. i did my a&o session back in june and registered then when there was, by minimum, at least half of the class avaliable. but no. not anymore. i’m so tired of dealing with all of this. i won’t even be able to complete my degree anymore on time as i have to wait a whole ‘nother year for japanese. ugh. ugh. ugh. should’ve never attended a large school that failed to take in consideration of my needs. i’ve done everything i needed and yet nothing. just nothing. 

in the meantime, anybody have any other possible solutions to consider? i took the language placement test and have japanese experience when i took just one course, although was still eligible for japn101. maybe i should look into community college instead? i’m genuinely not too sure what to do. i contacted the academic advisors and they said they will help me but it’s just me in limbo for now. yes, i probably am very entitled. but this is my graduation requirement we are talking about! i need full four years of japanese and now i just may have to take it for five years instead. i apologize for my passion in the previous paragraphs, but please, bare with me.",advice

"applying to grad school with little experience? hi!

uw psych grad school applications open on september 1st, and i’ve been panicking…a lot. i’m entering my senior year here, and i got into the psych major last year, on the b.s. track. since then, i’ve completed almost all pre-reqs. i just have statistics, one or two electives, and labs to complete. however, this also includes psych 499. 

psych 499 is undergrad psychological research and it’s required for the b.s. track. all summer, i’ve been applying to research/reaching out to faculty to get credit for this course, but nothing has really solidified. i need research experience to graduate, but also, i feel like it would come in handy on my grad school application.

i joined the huskies@work program, and was matched with the most amazing mentor who taught me so much about the psych graduate program at uw. since then, i’ve been really considering a gap year before applying to grad school, but i’m not sure. i want to go on the clinical route and work in neuropsychology, but to apply, i feel like i need to get experience in. at the moment, i really don’t have clinical or research experience. with the application opening up soon, i feel like i should apply, but i also feel like the chances of me getting in are quite low with my lack of experience. i have a competitive gpa, and experience working and volunteering, but nothing specifically psych related.

i wanted to post on here to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience, or if any grad students have advice. should i apply to uw and risk being turned down (but maybe i’ll get in?), or should i take a gap year? i also plan to apply to other schools, but uw is my dream grad school. i just want to ask what others think. thank you :)

i do really good in school and i can get high grades. i like that you can do whatever you want in your classes and no one can tell you what to do. the professor isn’t watching you step by step. that’s what i really like. it also doesn’t have that much bullshit. the professors also are very helpful and concerned. idk what to do cause i really love school. maybe it’s the job that i had which was very strict. maybe it will be different when i find a non student job and one that pays good with my degree.",advice

"tip for freshmans: don’t feel ashamed if you don’t do good in the weedout courses i wish i was given this advice when i first came here. at uw weed out classes are meant for you to do poorly as stated in the name. sometimes they are natural weed out courses like ochem for premed students, but at uw it’s meant to filter out the students who are able you achieve impossible standards and the students who aren’t able to get the highest grades. at uw, it’s merely to control application/acceptance volume into the major. 

in my experience, i took the accounting series since i’m a business major. the actual content you learn in class is the same anywhere you go. they don’t explain concepts “better” than other institutions. the content isn’t more difficult to learn as well. at uw, i felt like they gave you less examples and were expected to understand everything on your own whereas the community college made sure the students understood the concepts and went into every detail. despite that, the big difference are exams. 

exams in the weed out courses felt insane compared to what i was used to. the professors threw in so many trick questions to test what you retained from lecture. for example, they gave a bunch of unnecessary information and expected you to use only the information required. it wasn’t as straight forward as the practice problems in class. a lot of the problems you had to think through them, but they felt extremely long and required multiple steps. also, the exams were extremely long like a thick packet of paper. they also barely gave any partial credit. most students were rushing to finish at the end or didn’t end up finishing.

with all this, it was difficult to achieve the grade i wanted in the classes because of so many factors despite studying my ass off. it was like i understood the concepts, but the tricks and time constraints got to me. it felt humanly impossible to finish on time and make zero mistakes. this is especially difficult for people with learning disabilities like me. 

your grade in these classes do not reflect what you know as long as you studied and put in all your effort. they are meant to trip you up or else everyone will have straight a’s which uw doesn’t like. there are people with the ability to meet these standards, but the system doesn’t let everyone. it’s easy to feel like you’re not built for this school. you have to realize that the system is meant to create gaps at this school so only the top performers get a spot while people who are below fight for a spot. it’s really fucked up. but that is why you should not let it get to you. 

despite all this, there are classes that aren’t so tough and are supportive of learning. you should cherish those classes especially in your first 2 years.",discussion

i am confused why my scholarship was cut down if i'm getting money given back anyways. i asked the finaid office (uw tacoma) but was told that it was because of my need already being met by the grants. if that's why, then why are they still giving me $900 back?

"bus etiquette with things picking up around campus and classes starting tomorrow (good luck everyone, you've got this!), i've noticed a lot of unseasoned public transit users, to put it bluntly. overall riding the buses is pretty straightforward, but there's quite a few things that make the experience easier for everyone.

* make sure you tap your husky card when you board! most buses have the card reader at the front, but some bus models (namely the rapidride) have a card reader by the back doors to expedite the process. tapping on is very important for the metro services to gauge route popularity, which can lead to more frequent buses in the future! (it's also already paid for via your tuition, so take advantage of it!)
* remember to pull the cord by the windows when you want to get off at the next stop (it's usually yellow or silver). there's also a red ""stop"" button on the pole next to the back door that can be pressed for the same reason. the drivers only stop at bus stops if someone requests to get off or to pick up passengers, so don't assume the bus will stop unless you pull the cord!
* when someone requests to stop, there's an indicator for that. some buses have a red light that lights up above the destination sign (the marquee at the front of the bus that shows the time/route number or the next stop; i had to look it up to see what it's actually called lol), while others just go back and forth between the next stop and ""stop requested.""
* if the bus is relatively empty it's totally fine to sit in the aisle seat or place your bag in the aisle seat, but when the bus starts to become crowded, please scoot over or move your bag so someone can sit next to you. i usually hold mine or set it at my feet.
* if you see an empty seat, take it! sitting next to strangers may take a bit to get used to, and obviously use your best judgment when sitting next to a stranger, but it's really important to make room in the bus for more passengers. nothing is worse than a ""full bus"" that's only full because people don't want to sit next to others.
* when it's standing room only, *please move all the way to the back of the bus*. not to the steps in front of the back door, up the steps and *all the way to the back*. the bus can fit at least 5 more people on it when people go all the way to the back. there are many poles and hand straps you can use to hold on to.
* say thank you to your bus drivers! they have a hard but extremely important job and don't get paid enough :)

these are obviously just the basics, and each line is a little different, but these are some things i've noticed on the lines that go straight to campus.

happy riding, and good luck this quarter :) ",advice

* sometimes they give out free stuff in front of the hub from clubs or whatever. there's also occasionally food trucks there like bbq and what not. if you have time, def take a stroll. i was given laundry detergent by the sustainability club once it was cool but i forgot the name of it
* everybody needs to go to the bathroom for a #2 at some point. explore campus and see which bathroom gives you the maximum comfort for blowing up the toilet without the embarrassment
* the starbucks line at suzello is always so long and there's no order ahead. might as well as do order ahead for the starbucks on the ave and go pick it up
* join clubs if you can! you can always quit, its not a cult. you might find it fun. one of my regret is not being in a club
* if you wanna do research, start emailing profs early. don't overthink, just type up a short intro, attach resume, state motivation, and hit send. 
* if ur on a budget, sizzles and crunch has protein packed salad/rice bowls and its usually large enough you can split it between lunch and dinner
* if you go to the business building(s), them rich mfs are always holding some kind of event and it comes with free food/lunch. so watch for that. also good place to study and nap. 
* there are therapy dogs but the lines are long asf. not worth it.
* burke museum is free, go visit with friends

i am a biochem major who needs to take chem 452 and 453. i was signed up for the course with professor gary drobny, and he seems very charismatic and friendly. however, his lectures go at 100mph and are hard to follow even though i am confident in my calculus abilities and read the slides beforehand. i also felt as though the topics do not apply to biochemistry as much as i hoped, and it feels just like a more advanced physics course (pistons, springs, etc). we were supposed to have our first quiz this friday, and we have not gone over any problems in lecture and the homework is very tedious. because of this and my 17 (science) credit workload and financial aid discrepancies, i ended up dropping the class to take it at a later time. my questions are as follows: who is the best professor to take this course with? i would not mind taking professor drobny again if needed, but i am open to other suggestions. also, is the 452/453 a/b summer option a doable thing? i have heard people mention the final (especially drobny's) is particularly brutal in that sequence. not looking forward to taking the series at all, but i understand it is inevitable.

unfortunately, now i'm at a complete loss as to who i should reach out to for letters of recommendation for my grad school applications. i have two professors who i did get to know relatively well and have asked, but i need a third for one of my programs and could really use someone who's in the field i'm intending to go into, because for whatever reason the two professors i have in mind are both past english professors of mine, and i'm applying for a masters in mental health counseling program, so it's not totally related. i'm just at a loss because i really want to be applying for fall 2024 because i'll have to take a whole year off otherwise, but i have to have letters of recommendation by early january, so this quarter is my chance to connect with my professors.

"sick-like people on campus let's be honest here. if you are sick and have symptoms of either the flu, the common cold, or maybe covid again, please stay home and get some rest. however, this is my personal opinion and you do not have to follow what i tell you to do, because you have your own situation on being sick and going to campus. if you do come to campus while having symptoms, please do west a mask. the previous labeled discussion about this was more of a rant instead of an actual discussion, since the poster complained about sick people in lecture halls, licking doorknobs (really? licking doorknobs is what sick people actually do? do i live in the same world as you?) and wishes yall the worst. do not mind his words, since if he was the one who was the sick person who comes to campus, he would wishes himself the worst. apologies in advance, but this is your logic. don't be upset at me when you created the option of possibility.

if you are just having coughing, coughing is not always a sick symptom. i have had asthma, so i did occasionally coughed, especially in cold weather. sneezing is also in the same category. you can sneeze if you have pollen in your nose or something along the sorts of that. if you're superstitious, sneezing would pair with someone talking about you. 

now for the people who would love for people who are sick to wear a mask or stay home, why would they listen to yall? now obviously, it would make sense for people who are sick to take preventive measures for themselves and other around them. but are there actual repercussions in not doing so? will they be slapped with a fine or a ticket for coming to lectures when they have symptoms of sickness? no, they would not. if you did that sort of option, obviously that would deter people who are sick coming on campus, but we all know here it's a stupid idea. or you can complain. here. on this subreddit. anonymously. i don't know you, nor you don't know me. social media is a wondrous thing, don't you think?

"transfer senior panic i transferred in fall ‘22, and was told that while all of my credits from my oos, non cc university would/ should/ will/ can/ (etc) transfer over and i’ll have plenty of credits besides the credits i’d need take within my new engineering major to graduate. now, i’m being told that that isn’t the case, and my advisers are way to chill with me taking an extra quarter to graduate (i’m supposed to be and was told many times i’d be a spring 2024 graduate). 

for a variety of reasons, i absolutely cannot delay my graduation for an extra quarter. i’m luckily getting in state tuition, but one of the personal conditions of my transfer between my family and i was that i would graduate on time. i absolutely cannot take an extra quarter, and my advisers aren’t working with me on this. 

even worse, i’d be taking an extra quarter to fulfill requirements such as freshman year physics or a 100 level writing class that i was unable to get into. i find this incredibly frustrating, and i’m not sure what to do besides overload my schedule for the next two quarters to make my graduation deadline. has anyone experienced this, and what was the solution you came to?

"why are professors able to get away with being ""bad at technology"" at this point? sort of a rant, sort of an actual question.

in my time at uw, my experience with professors has varied in all sorts of ways, but one things that's truly been all over the place is their ability to use the basic technology-related tools provided to them. it seems to be most problematic when it's canvas. a lot of professors seem to make it work, but a good handful of professors are completely incompetent when it comes to using canvas. i'm not sure if it's technically a requirement for classes here to use canvas, but it seems to at least be the standard expectation for students.

i'm currently in a class where the canvas page is a total wreck, **and** the professor hasn't provided any sort of outline for the class like many professors do in the syllabus, so it's somewhat difficult to keep up with what we're supposed to be doing. there aren't even dates for quizzes or exams posted. the professor loves to say she's ""so bad at technology"" and stuff, but she's like...thirty. to help you further picture what the class is like, she can barely make a slideshow work. maybe i'd understand if it was a professor who was old as the hills and about to retire, but it seems ridiculous that professors who have been around technology for the majority of their life and career struggle to use the standard tech for their job. it's just aggravating when a professor doesn't keep their canvas coherent and also doesn't provide a road map for assignments in the syllabus.

so on to the actual questions i'm curious about, does uw provide any resources to professors to figure out how to use canvas/other basic tech they're expected to use? does uw offer guidance for how professors can best structure their class/communicate that structure to students? is canvas required to be used in classes?",discussion

"do not have any second thoughts about graduate certificates at uw or else you will lose money i really do not like the way that uw handles graduate school work at their school, so much so that i will be looking elsewhere after experiencing what happens when you quickly decide you do not want to do it. there are plenty of really nice schools in wa that i am sure do not do this. you have only 7 days to drop out of your classes, otherwise, you have to pay 50% of your entire tuition for that quarter. that is absolutely absurd. so at a minimum, if you have any second thoughts after only a week into a certificate, you are already paying well over a thousand dollars for it. i don't want to call it a scam, but wow, i really know how uw is getting a lot of their money from students after experiencing this unfortunate circumstance myself. that is an insane system that is far too harsh on anyone that is wanting to better their lives.  


the fact that they prop it up as something that is possible for people that are working full-time and that you can accomplish a certificate that can then lead into a graduate degree feels misleading, so i dropped my classes and wanted out. i genuinely wonder how many other people have had their money taken by uw because after a week into their certificate they went ""yeah, i don't like this."" 7 days is way too soon to charge the 50% of the entire quarter tuition and it is infuriating. i also really do not like how they do not make this information more aware. so, for anyone that is wondering about certificates at uw, watch out. be 100% locked in on your decision or you are getting to get screwed over.",advice

"questions about safety, transportation, social life, and academics at udub hi!:) i’m a singaporean student who is considering studying (undergrad) psychology in udub. i have some questions below!

safety in the city:
coming from a place as safe as singapore (and also because i’m a small asian female), i'm wondering about the safety aspects in seattle. what's the general consensus on when it's safe to walk outside, especially as a female, whether alone or in a group? any safety precautions or tips i should be aware of? i'm looking to work on my situational awareness to adapt to this change should i end up coming to seattle. 


safety in the canpus: 
i saw the post about uw being ranked the 26th most dangerous campus in the us. do y’all say that ranking is valid? were  there really murder, assault or rape cases recently? 😅i googled ‘washington uni murder’ and got nothing in the campus directly. 

transportation in seattle:
do i need a car in seattle? are the cities/towns surrounding seattle accessible without a car? how safe/reliable is public transport? how safe is it to take when i’m on my own, and what time is the latest i should be on it? and for those times when i'd like to explore the surroundings, how much would a rideshare like 'grab' typically cost? 

exploring washington's nature:
i've heard that washington has loads of beautiful nature.  how do those of you without cars manage to enjoy the natural beauty? any tips for public transportation or organized group trips for hiking and such?

udub as a commuter school?:
is udub considered a commuter school? i'll be arriving in seattle alone, and i'm eager to make friends not only with other international students but also with americans. are locals generally open to new friendships? are there any tips for breaking into social circles? are high school cliques challenging to break into?
also, i’m not a huge drinker. in fact i’m not a fan of alcohol although i don’t mind drinking occasionally. would this negatively affect my social life a lot? i’m wondering whether it’ll be difficult to find a bunch of nerdy friends in udub.

lastly, is it common to eat out with friends? i’ll be coming to udub on a budget and probably can’t afford to eat out every day so i wanna know if i’ll suffer a lot socially if i pack my own food or something.


participation in school clubs:
i'm planning to join some school clubs, like some boardgames/d&d clubs, outdoor clubs, and more. do members typically hang out for meals or drinks after club sessions, or do most people head straight home?


psychology program at uw:
lastly, i'm interested in the psychology program at uw. could anyone share their experiences or insights about it? are there direct postgraduate pathways, or do most require work experience?

also, does the school have industry connections and good internship placements? i am hoping to do some marketing related internships in the us just in case i don’t make it into postgrad for psych.

"how competitive and math-y is an economics major? hi, i am a intended philosophy major who is looking to double major in economics, i have heard they are a good combination and i have a bunch of extra credits from doing ib/ap in high school so i either double major or graduate early lol

anyway, i'm not a huge mathy guy, i did pretty well in high school calculus but was always more of a humanities guy which is why i have philosophy as my major which is my passion. however, i took an ib econ class in high school and enjoyed it, though it was pretty basic concepts. how much math is involved in the more advanced econ classes at udub?

also, from some older posts (6-7 years ago) on this sub, a common discussion is about how rampant cheating is in upper-level econ classes. apparently, there are hella international students who will do anything to get the perfect score in these classes, and since they are apparently curved pretty hard,  honest students' gpas get tanked. as a student who is planning on going on to grad/law school, would these upper-level econ classes tank my gpa and lower my chances?

so is the state of econ at udub still very competitive, gpa-killing, and rampant with cheating, or is it better now? should someone who's not really into math still take the major (ba, of course, you couldn't force me to take all the math classes required for an econ bs)?

also as a side note, i was looking into sociology as a possible double major with philosophy instead of econ, since it seems to overlap with econ concepts a lot but just a lot less math.

also also, i have had a meeting with my advisor about all this stuff but bro just told me to ""take an econ class and see if you like it"" which was ultimately pretty useless ngl",academics

[https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/decolonization-narrative-dangerous-and-false/675799/?gift=hx9sqhv08lbrwvn6qkuvo9nn3\_rxtqfyagrppxe6gca&utm\_source=copy-link&utm\_medium=social&utm\_campaign=share](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/decolonization-narrative-dangerous-and-false/675799/?gift=hx9sqhv08lbrwvn6qkuvo9nn3_rxtqfyagrppxe6gca&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share)

1. israel is not a settler colonial state. 

one of the main themes seen at the rallies around campus is that israel is accused of stealing palestinians' land. this allegation is sometimes used to justify what happened on 10/7, as if israel deserved a massive terror attack that was a declaration of war no matter how you slice it. 

for the purposes of this post, i'll keep claims to the land brief. both jews and palestinians have a claim to the land. however, jews have always had a presence in israel. from around 1300 bc to the construction of solomon's temple to the sicarii revolt to the spanish inquisition, it was always historically seen the jews' land. as such, jews aren't just white. they are also mizrahi, sephardic, iraqi, ethiopian etc. even some ashkenazi jews aren't completely white either. 

in 1947, the un had created a partition plan that was going to split israel between jews and arabs. at the time of british mandatory palestine, jews and arabs had both owned about 10% of the land. jews were legally immigrating to british mandatory palestine to escape pogroms and persecution in europe. the british restricted jewish immigration in 1939 due to escalating arab riots and terrorist attacks (which you can read about here:  [https://www.timesofisrael.com/1921-jaffa-riots-100-years-on-mandatory-palestines-1st-mass-casualty-event/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/1921-jaffa-riots-100-years-on-mandatory-palestines-1st-mass-casualty-event/) and here:  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/white\_paper\_of\_1939](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_paper_of_1939)  ).  jews subsequently illegally immigrated to israel to escape the holocaust. 

when israel had declared independence in 1948, surrounding arab countries had collectively attacked to destroy the nascent jewish state. while there was some forced expulsion by irgun, the overwhelming majority of arabs were fleeing war or were told to leave by their leaders. wealthier civilians had left earlier prior to the attack because they expected a quick victory over israel. at the same time, it is estimated that \~800,000 jews were forcibly expelled from surrounding arab countries to live in israel where nobody shared a common language. 

2. israel's siege of gaza is legal, and does not constitute a war crime. 

israel is not engaging in collective punishment, but please understand that war isn't really fair to anybody. hamas' attack on 10/7 has been aptly compared to our 9/11. israel has a legitimate casus belli.   for the sake of israel's national security, they can't have a neighbor that has a mission to completely destroy them. the distance between hamas and israel is the distance between campus and downtown, and sometimes even closer. it's like if al qaeda was based in long island since 1984, and lobbed rockets into nyc every year up to 9/11. 

what complicates matters is hamas uses human shields and civilian infrastructure. they do this because they understand western morality sees any civilian death as bad. there is a distinction between accidentally killing civilians in a warzone and targeting civilians indiscriminately.  generally speaking, once hamas converts civilian infrastructure to a military installation or plans to, it becomes a legitimate idf target. hamas is legally, morally, and politically responsible for any civilian death that happens in gaza because they put them in harm's way.  

because of hamas' historical use of humanitarian supplies, israel does not have to supply water or electricity either in wartime. for the moment, israel is only sending utilities to south gaza but it can be assumed that almost any supplies will be intercepted by hamas. prior to the war, hamas had used israel's lending of water to turn around and build rockets.  instead of building any sort of energy infrastructure, hamas pretty much spends all their fuel on firing rockets. 

to understand more about the legalities talked about the conflict, you can read more here:

the conflict sucks. i hope that the current round of fighting resolves quickly, and that israel will help rebuild afterwards. what nobody is prepared to do is occupy gaza again after israel unilaterally left in 2006.  if palestinians are committed to a 2 state solution, they should elect somebody who isn't hamas after the war. again, i hope we can keep discussion civil and respectful.

i support palestine, but condemn israel - palestine people are people too, you can't treat them like animals

that said, i'm reading on their standard admissions page that the deadline for fall is april 5, and i should have all the pre-application prerequisites done by then, as well as all the pre-admission prerequisities done by the end of this spring quarter and my senior year of hs. has anyone got accepted into the uw without direct admission, but then applied for standard admission during their senior year before enrollment? is it even possible/allowed? i see a page for ""transfer/running start"" students, but i don't know if that means much.

i don’t know, i do pretty well on the programming assignments but i feel like this is gonna ruin my gpa. i did my third quiz today, and while i felt pretty confident, seeing my last quiz really makes me feel distrustful of that confidence.

"sucked in an academic misconduct case? i’ll start from the beginning, i was with my lab partner doing lab projects. i did my part and threw the files for him to modify for the final submission. i also turned in my files on the due date just in case.

a few days later, he went to demo the file with ta. i was not present due to personal reasons and i notified the professor. my lab partner found out there was some issue with the file so he turned to his friend in another group for help. they are friends so another group gave him the entire project and my lab partner straight up copied parts of the code. however, i was notified of this through messages but i didn’t bother to say anything because i was with my relative at the hospital.

and apparently ta found out that there are some files that are identical (since they demoed to the same ta) and reported to the professor.

today the four of us had a meeting with the professor, my lab partner tried not to put the blame on another group so he was saying he “took some pictures of the code and copied it” but the prof didn’t buy it.

the professor suspect that me and another person in another group (not my lab partner’s friend) are “potentially getting sucked in the situation for what other people did” but because he didn’t believe the story my partner gave him, so he is reporting the incident to the college level and we should hear back next week.

this is my first time being in this situation, just want some advice or some scenarios you guys think might be happening.

i’m wondering, would it be stupid to give the professor a polite heads up that “hey, for at least some of the students this assignment is actually really stressful” or would that come off as disrespectful? i like the professor a lot and they’re very kind and understanding to their students, so i don’t wanna come off as rude (or bum them out, quite honestly). thoughts?",academics

"sad hitting hard, haven’t gone off campus once except to eat at the ave. anything fun to do/see in seattle? museums? exhibits? hi! i’m a first year student, out of state. lately, school for some reason has been making me feel super depressed so much so that most days i don’t leave my dorm/residence hall even if i have classes to attend. because of this i’ve been kinda struggling academically, but that’s beside the point. 

i have no reason to be depressed- i have friends on campus i talk to and text, friends that cook for me, i’m on antidepressants, i have a sun lamp and i have a therapist i talk to. i’m also a part of a bunch of clubs and am on hall council for my residential hall so i am involved in some events. i have hobbies that i keep up with too like drawing.

"are you ""actively"" thinking in your daily life? i was talking with someone today that said the majority of people are not thinking in their daily life. i was confused by what they meant and they explained that they believe when the average person is going about their business they don't think about anything beyond what is happening directly around them. they said that most people cannot be bothered to think about anything outside their own bubbles, and that some people don't even have any thoughts going through their head most of the time.

i think this is a bit absurd. i've met a few people that this probably applies to, but i think the vast majority of people are actively thinking about the world around them. when i am doing my daily routine, i am constantly thinking about everything. what do i want to do with my life? how can i be a better version of myself? why is x issue going on in our society? why do people do x thing? what makes someone right or wrong morally? 

i feel like when i am doing literally anything, my mind is constantly somewhere else. sure when i am in class i am engaging with the content, or when i am talking with someone i am focusing on the topic at hand. but when i am doing routine things like commuting, walking between classes, eating, exercising, etc... my mind is constantly focusing on a distant unrelated topic.

is this the norm? i started getting concerned when my friend was talking about this. i started thinking back to interactions i had with others on campus, and a lot of people really do seem to have no thoughts... when i would talk to people from classes most people don't seem to be able to talk about anything, even the course content! i know this isn't a major specific problem either because i have taken classes from majors where people are ""smart"" (cs, amath, physics, etc...) and people in these programs don't seem to be able to talk about anything either.

is this the ""seattle freeze"" people are always talking about? or are we witnessing the impact of social media on our society? i know that the idea about ""kids and their iphones"" is a meme, but i have wondered if short form content like tiktok can really have such a negative impact on our ability to think. i have noticed that as a society we seem to be growing more and more apathetic regarding everything and it is really alarming when people don't even seem to care to actively learn and engage with the content they are learning in a major that they picked and applied to! after interacting with people around campus, i genuinely worry that our society is heading towards an idiocracy. do others share this concern? am i looking too much into it?",discussion

"re: are you ""actively"" thinking in your daily life? i made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1877yl8/are_you_actively_thinking_in_your_daily_life/) a few days ago asking people if they are actively thinking in their daily lives. i received a variety of responses from people and upon reflection i do not think i was clear in what i was asking, which caused some people to question the sincerity of my post. 

obviously everyone ""thinks"" and people have thoughts going through their head constantly at varying rates. asking people if they are ""thinking"" was not the best way to start this discussion, and i can see how some people may have viewed that post in a negative light.

i have spent the last few weeks reflecting on my time at uw, and while i am grateful for the opportunities, connections, and friendships i have made here, i also have feelings of dissatisfaction. i got into a good program, which lead to good opportunities that i can pursue post-grad and i have made friends that i hope to stay in touch with into the future, but i feel as though i haven't developed as a person/adult as much as i would have liked during my time in college.

i expected going into a good university like uw that i would be able to engage with people that are passionate about a variety of topics, and can learn from their unique perspectives on the world. i feel as though i haven't really gotten to do any of that. granted, a significant portion of that time was during lock down, but we have been in person for couple of years now and after taking a variety of courses in person i can say that all of them have been pretty disappointing.

i think my disappointment is a result of a lack of engagement in any course. the discussion-based classes are difficult to get through as no one seems to want to engage in any of the content or participate in course dialogue. it becomes difficult to care about the content when it seems like none of your peers care at all. professors will ask questions to try to spark conversations and no one seems to want to answer unless they are specifically called on. when i try to cold approach people to discuss stuff in class i get one-word responses or just blank stares with ""i don't know"", followed by scrolling on their phone or laptop for the rest of the discussion. 

i have tried to join clubs to meet people who want to talk about literally any topic. this hasn't been easy since many of the clubs listed in the rso directory are abandoned. i was told this was because many officers graduated during the pandemic and no one was there to step into their roles. i have joined many dead discord servers for rsos and at this point i have kinda stopped even trying.

these experiences caused me to make my previous post, as i was curious if people are so preoccupied with their own stuff that they don't have the interest/energy to engage in anything beyond their own bubble, including course content. i understand that my last post was definitely worded poorly and i could have explained myself better, but i also know i am not the only one who has had these experiences after talking with some friends about this issue. 

maybe i am looking into in too much, but i genuinely feel like my time at college was kinda wasted. i don't feel any different leaving as i did coming in, which is upsetting. i hear about people who were able to grow as a person during their time in college and i am envious of their experience. i'm not talking about the ""eat, pray, love"" type of self discovery journey where i ""find myself"". i am merely saying that aside from the technical skills i have gained in some courses, i feel as though i haven't really learned anything from college. can anyone else relate to this? was college a waste of time and money or is this all that college is supposed to be? if so i feel as though i may have been better off at a coding boot camp rather than spending 4 years here.",discussion

"californian attending wsu interested in transferring here. i'm originally from california and transferred to wsu this fall after 3 years at community college. i was recommended to come here since my mother, sister and brother in law attended here. my major is computer engineering. my experience at wsu has been very unprofessional. not with my classes per say, but how i've been treated by the administration and staff as a california transfer. this has resulted me in seeking to transfer out, one of the schools i'm interested in being udub.

i've had a lot of problems getting classes transferred over here for credit, one of them i'm having to retake because wsu doesn't uphold the one from ca as their equal. i've had to submit plenty of course evaluation forms because wsu marked some of my classes (like linear algebra) as electives. the engineering counselors are lackluster. the university is also making me take a bunch of classes i never thought i would have to take, extending  my time here about 1-2 semesters (3 years here total), unless this is how it is for all transfer students at other universities. originally i intended to transfer to cal poly slo, so i completed all classes relative for transferring over there, and all california universities and community colleges are extremely tight, making it easy to transfer for in-state students (assist website).

i've had other huge problems, such as the residency living situation (they refused to move me out of a freshman dorm until a month and a half later, which i never prioritized on my application, and i'm 21 and applied for an upperclassman dorm). traveling around here is fairly restricted, with a bus transit system which isn't the best. you have moscow, idaho, 6 miles down the road but i have no personal vehicle. pullman is a very small town in the middle of nowhere dependent on the student life to keep it thriving. my family also owns a house in bremerton, and my sister and brother in law live in gig harbor, so i'd be closer to family. and frankly, i am not going to frats or partying as much as most people here (which is what this uni is known for) since i am a junior-level engineering major, where as the life at udub is more studious (or am i wrong? or is there a good social life as well?).

eventually, i will have to take higher level cs classes and the cs department here is extremely cutthroat, with terrible professors who are constantly leaving and wsu is bringing in international grad students to teach these classes. this seems to be a problem with wsu in general though, not just limited to the cs department since my diffy q class next semester has an international grad student teaching it. wsu seems to make very impulsive decisions, and lacks proper investment with their money. lots of places are run down around here and could use improvement, but instead they're dedicating 80 million dollars to a new engineering building which i think is outrageous and totally unnecessary with the one we have now.

i  did some research here and read that udub prioritizes transfer students who are not attending a 4 year institution. i'm wondering how that  would affect my chances in getting in here. the comp e program here is very similar to ee, so i would apply for the ece program at udub. my current gpa from transferring to wsu is 3.6, and i intend on getting a 3.7-4 gpa this semester. i'm also technically a wa resident, since i used my military background to get out of having to pay out-of-state tuition here at wsu and received a wa dl as a result.

can anyone give me advice who has been in a similar situation? also, how does udub compare to my experiences here at wsu with administration, the staff, treatment as a california out-of-state transfer, and getting credit for my classes?",advice

"disappointed with fish 340 / biol 340 experience - lorenz hauser - name and shame! as a junior, a poc, someone with financial struggles, and academically as someone who has taken very difficult classes, this ranks as one of the worst classes that i’ve taken at the uw and other students can agree with me. 

we had a very  challenging time in fish 340 / biol 340 under lorenz hauser's instruction, alongside tas bryan and marta. the course lacked organization, making it difficult to navigate. despite efforts to seek help, explanations often fell short. grading was not ideal across the board—receiving conflicting advice from tas and classmates online in feedbackfruits made it perplexing to discern what was needed for assignments. lab sessions were similarly confusing, with changing instructions creating difficulties in following along and performing experiments effectively. while the course material itself wasn't overly complex, the delivery and guidance were subpar, hindering the learning experience. there were instances during labs where seeking guidance resulted in no responses, “i can’t tell you the answer’ by the tas, leaving us feeling stranded rather than guided. the grading of exams seemed arbitrary, and the subjectivity of the graders left many of us anxious about our final grades. additionally, the use of chatgpt  by the tas during office hours, without solid expertise in genetics, added to the frustration. considering my experience, i'd suggest exploring alternative courses if possible. 

compilation student remarks: 

“grading was horrible in the class, they never told us what’s wrong. one ta would tell me that i wrote my discussion section fine and not to worry about it, while the other ta would tell me to rewrite the entire section (bryan mostly, with marta being the lenient grader, but this went back and forth depending on what i showed them on my laptop.) this experience was repeated during multiple office hours, with the tas giving me one piece of advice, the professor, and the somewhat terrible advice that students would give each other because things were graded on feedback fruits.”

“like for the first couple of labs as well—they were changing numbers during our session and it made things confusing for me to process, because like im listening tot them change instructions, then having to write it down, then i am needing to actually perform the experiment.”

“while the content itself wasn’t super challenging their instruction and way of delivering it made things very challenging.”

“during some of the labs, bryan would tell us that ‘he can’t give us the answer’ all we are doing is asking for some guidance and you’re replying with that… most likely they didn’t know the answers themselves either.”

“exams are also graded brutally, and we are all worried for our grade in the class after this final. we don’t know how it will be graded because the graders are very subjective. they want the answers in their own words and find an opportunity to take off points for everything. if they want us to practice critical thinking in this class then maybe they should practice what they preach.“ 

“they were not  knowledgable themselves, i realized this after attending their office hours, they use chatgpt to answer the questions and really need to take a course on genetics before teaching it. they are on the whole very poor teachers.“ 

“advice: if it’s not a requirement, take another class if you can. worst genetics class that i’ve taken as an oceanography major and my friends in biology feel the same. take genome 361 if you need the requirement!” ",academics
"master of communication in digital media advice - 2024 a changing climate. hey, i was wondering if there is anyone who can speak to the masters of communication in digital media. 

i just turned 29 and have only recently started working 2 years ago. i am finding that my gap in experience is holding me back as every job interview i get beaten out by someone with years of experience or a specific degree. 

i currently work full time as a digital marketing manager at a startup then freelance work sporadically before that. my main focus is on content strategy, production and execution. i would love to involve myself more with the process and have an understanding of it all at a higher level. i seem to be stuck in a position where i am only planning, creating and posting content and none of the higher level stuff. 

i'm really happy where my content is at and i'm very capable with social media and most of the digital landscape but i really want to advance my career. i seem to be held back with lack of training/experience in the field. i would love to break into the tech industry.

this degree looks perfect, a blend of what i'm already doing + the extra knowledge that will allow me to take on bigger and better positions. does anyone have any experience with it?

"professor not responding to emails about being sick? hi! here is some context 

i have been intermittently sick all quarter, at first it was a respiratory infection, then strep, and through that i was sucking it up, wearing a mask and showing up to classes and exams. however, over thanksgiving break i started to feel even worse and got some blood work done. on top of all of that i have mono!! that week it hit me like a truck and i couldn't stay away for more than 5ish hours at a time, usually just laying in bed. due to various complications, i ended up also getting tonsillitis. through this, i have tried my best to do all of my assignments and i immediately emailed my professors to let them know what the situation was and i even included a note from my doctor. i told them that i was sick, still doing canvas assignments, but wouldn't be able to make it in person for a while.

every single professor responded except for my physics professor. i double checked his syllabus and it says to email him about absences, not a ta. it's been weeks and i've sent a follow up email. his is the only class i'm in with graded participation and i'm worried that the ~17 (to be honest it may be even more) days of missed class will affect my grade.

is there anything i can do to appeal this after the fact? i was in no shape to take that exam. normally i would let it go and accept that sometimes my health is going to take things that matter to me but this might cost me my major. i hate talking about my health with people and grade grubbing but i cannot let this grade stay on my transcript. 

i will go to my professor and do my best but max he gives me some partial cred here and there. 

do you think it would be worth going to urgent care now, a couple of days later to get a note? is there a policy that uw has that i don't know about? can drs help me at all? i'm kind of desperate. i got shot in the foot at the beginning of the race and i don't just want to lay down and take it.

"getting help is not helpful wondering if anybody else experiences this. i’m a stem student, and i rarely ever seek out all the academic help that’s pushed at students. part of the reason is because i often walk away feeling stupid and hopeless – worse than before i tried to be proactive. “go to office hours!” “meet with the ta!” “schedule an appointment with the professor!” “talk to an advisor!” it’s particularly frustrating to me because what i just listed are always quoted as top things you should do to succeed – it’s like false advertising. 

of course, not all bad. some folks are awesome at what they do, and genuinely want to help you learn. but the number of times i’ve really tried to ask for help and got the dgaf repetition of the information i already knew, or the demeaning once-through of an “easy” problem, or just come away having wasted an hour i could have spent watching organic chemistry tutor makes me want to stay in my own space and do what i can alone.

i'm taking chem 241 this quarter, which is my first chem lab since autumn 2022. i've had migraines since 2021 before i even came to uw. physically, i always felt fine in gen chem labs. but it's been 2 days of ochem lab and here's what i've noticed during lab:

i get a bad headache almost immediately. it feels like a migraine headache but without the aura. my head gets super heavy and foggy. yesterday i thought maybe my goggles were too tight so i stepped out to loosen them a bit and it didn't help. i also feel really weak and like i'm gonna pass out (i know i won't, i never do). it's overall so miserable that i can't concentrate and i end up making so many stupid mistakes. last night i felt awful bc i feel like i let my partners down and idk how i'm gonna get through the next ~5 months of this. this happens even though i make sure i've drank water and eaten right before. and then i feel fine within ~1 hour after lab.

i know nobody likes 3 hr labs and wearing goggles and all that, but this is a new struggle for me and i swear it has to do w my migraines getting worse over the past year. 

any advice/tips? i'm rly dreading lab tmrw bc i'm scared i'll feel so unwell during it again and i want to be able to do my best work :(",advice

"bioc 405 study tips hi all,

i am currently in bioc 405 with david veesler, and we have our first exam coming up soon. i have been keeping up with lecture slides, taking notes on prelecture videos and the in person lectures, taken every quiz, and have been doing the practice problems for the post-lecture material. i have also memorized all 20 amino acids and can identify/draw them with no problem, and i know the necessary pka values as well. 

however, with the newer material in the last few lectures such as enzyme kinetics, symmetry, etc., i literally do not know what to write down and study because i have no idea what is being presented to me. part of it is the professors heavy french accent which makes it difficult to understand what he is saying, and the other part of it is the word soup being thrown at us without any practice. we are shown super complex slides/equations and are not given anything really to practice them with. then we are told we need to memorize equations for specific scenarios of enzymes, and pretty much all the rest of the material on the lecture slides as well.

needless to say, despite my diligent studying, i feel quite overwhelmed and unprepared for next week’s exam, and the subsequent exams in this class. i aced gen chem and o chem, but that was largely because the material was presented in a much more interactive way and we were given plenty of practice with the content. here, we are just presented with a ton of info and expected to make sense of it ourselves. i’ve also gathered that the average score for these exams is about 65% or less, which should be an embarrassment to the professors. how do they expect us to understand the content when it’s being presented like this? does anyone have any tips on exam prep for this class? i want to 4.0 it but it does not feel possible. thank you all!

"is it still super hard to get into the cse major now? (presumably, because the faculty are taking in mostly direct admits) i wanna go to a tech company but i am not a direct admit, what are my options? hi, everyone. i hear this a lot throughout any resource i use to know more about uw: it is hard as hell to transfer to cse in uw from a pre-major(eg. pre-science). 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

if you think this post is long, please just read the paragraph after 'overall'!!!

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

when i first got admitted at uw, i was thinking of getting most pre-requisite courses such as cse, math, and physics from an outside institution which may have a relatively generous grading system(i know these pre-requisites are all weed-out courses, so the grading at uw will be very tough). and next, i will try really hard on the remaining 2-3 pre-requisites(such as if i need to take cse 121, 122, 123, i will take 121,122 at an outside institution where the grading could be easier first so if cse 123 really gets tough, at least my average grade will not be affected too much). 

when i first got admitted at uw, i was thinking of getting most pre-requisite courses such as cse, math, and physics from an outside institution which may have relatively generous grading system(i know these pre-requisites are all weed-out courses, so the grading at uw will be very tough). and next i will try really hard on the remaining 2-3 pre-requisites(such as if i need to take cse 121, 122, 123, i will take 121,122 at an outside institution where the grading could be easier first so if cse 123 really gets tough, at least my average grade will not be affected too much). 

will this work for me to get into the cse major or something related to cs? at least if i try really hard, a gpa of 3.7-3.9 is achievable through this method. to take all the weed-out courses only at uw and maintain a gpa like this would be much harder. so will this method work out?

&#x200b;

\###but here is the thing, if getting into cse major would mean a 4.0 gpa + a very good essay, it is very hard but doable. but is it like now a 4.0 gpa and a well-written essay will still be pretty far from enough to get into the cse major? if that is the thing, there are only two option for me:

first is to get into a major less competitive such as applied math-data science option. but the issue is that i wanna get into a tech company. if the market gets warmer and the hiring freeze starts to cease to a degree, will this land me a job anyway or i have to get a computing degree however the current it market is? can i get a good tech job with a applied math degree from uw(i know this is not the only factor to get a job, but lets just compare them)? will this be very different from a cse degree?

when i first got admitted at uw, i was thinking of getting most pre-requisite courses such as cse, math, and physics from an outside institution which may have a relatively generous grading system(i know these pre-requisites are all weed-out courses, so the grading at uw will be very tough). and next i will try really hard on the remaining 2-3 pre-requisites(such as if i need to take cse 121, 122, 123, i will take 121,122 at an outside institution where the grading could be easier first so if cse 123 really gets tough, at least my average grade will not be affected too much). 

&#x200b;

overall, is it now almost impossible to get into the cse major if not being a direct admit? can i get a good substitution for cse at uw such as what i mentioned, applied math? if none of these will actually work, i may start to double-think about getting my degree here because all i am pursuing right now is to get a cs job after i graduate.

"is math 126 possible without ""fully completing"" math 125? good morning,  


i was thinking about taking math 126 spring quarter. the problem is, i never ""fully completed"" math 125 however i do have credit for it. at my high school, our ap calc ab class had an option to take chs credit instead of the ap test. since i planned on attending a school instate, i opted for the chs credits and transferred them here. for the class, **i got credit for both math 124 & 125**, however in terms of curriculum, we probably made it halfway through 125 (or maybe even less).  


in my current position, is it a bad idea to take math 126? for the record i am a first year student and i have not taken a math class since i graduated high school in 2023. i plan on majoring in informatics, and i will be applying this spring. i already have all of my info pre-reqs complete so now i plan on working on pre-reqs for potential backup majors (like statistics).

here are the options i have thought about but i'm not sure any of them are a good idea.  


* my advisor said that i can retake math 125 to refresh on the course content, however this could be a waste because i already have the credit. (also i have been told that this is risky because if i do poorly, i could have both 125 and 126 ruining my gpa)
* my advisor also suggested that i can just take the class now and spend a lot of time at the instructional center because i'm an omad student.
* my advisor also mentioned that if i'm confident in my info application, i should just wait to see if i'm rejected before thinking about pre-reqs for other majors. in this case, he was suggesting i wait until fall. then if i get into info on my first try, i don't have to worry about taking 126.
* i have also thought about taking the course over the summer at somewhere like edmonds cc, and just transferring it in.  


so i guess my question would be, which out of those options is the best? or is there another option that's better that i don't have listed?

"geography data science: everything you need to know hello dawgs,

if you're reading this, you either didn't get into a major or you're a freak that likes maps. either way, it's going to be okay. 

i'm writing this because there is a severe lack of student resources about the geography data science major, and it is an open major which creates a lot of questions.  so from the coursework to the department to the career prospects, i am going to give you everything i know about being in gds.

**how do you know if gds is for you?** 

you need to have a passion for data visualization, coding, and maps. it is a great technical degree in a growing industry.

first of all, the geography department is a relatively small department of students and faculty that is hidden on the fourth floor of smith hall. from what i've seen, geography coursework is separated into two categories. half of the classes are more humanities-based geography classes focused on the historical, political, and socio-economic aspects of geography. highly interesting, but nothing technical. the other half are data science classes focused on developing maps with custom software and scripting languages.

geography data science is a bachelors of science degree. an audit will require that you take a shit ton of 300 level geography classes, intro cse classes, and a machine learning course(s). 

**the classes i have taken in order of importance:**  
geog 360: intro mapping class focused on an open-source mapping software, qgis. somewhat tedious, maybe a little boring, but highly important.

geog 458: taught by the same prof as 328, another class that teaches more advanced techniques for geospatial web programming. the projects you build in this class can be pretty professional. html/css/mapbox/arcgis api js/node.js/postgresql. also a choose your own adventure and teaches you a lot about mapping ethics.

geog 328: teaches you how to create web based visualizations using javascript/html/css and mapbox. great technical add and covers a lot of material. projects are great for a portfolio.

geog 465: introductory sql class teaching you how to map using a postgresql backend. highly important for full-stack coding, a little tedious at times.

geog 450: a python course focused on creating seattle based visualizations that have nothing to do with maps. teaches python scripting, web crawling, d3.js and more. not the most necessary class but certainly helpful.

favorite profs: 

gunwha oh: the dawg, super sweet korean lady that cares about her job, her students, and maps!

bo zhao: the beast, this guy makes maps like a mofo. best laid-out classes in the major. all on github.

&#x200b;

**career prospects:**

* level one: arcgis monkey, using esri products to build out data viz. this is the most simplistic, most common way to perform gis and the lowest paying.
* level two: gis web dev, create geospatial applications using full stack.
* level three: geospatial data scientist, be a god of the domain. basically, just a data scientist with a geospatial stack, creating data pipelines, viz, applications, and ml models. 

there are infinite ways to make money in geospatial. just think, the more skilled you are the more you are likely to get paid.

where can i work?:  
any tier-one company, of course. anything that has to do with maps. i noticed a lot of government jobs require highly specific geospatial web app skills. even pokemon go hires geography data scientists. look up esri as well, this is one of the largest mapping companies.

classes i have heard about:

urban gis, geog 317 and a few others are all esri based classes using arcgis. supposedly teach you some cool stuff with an industry staple software.

"given my unique situation, should i be putting my graduation date as march or june of 2024? hi all,

i’m a senior who will be graduating this year. i’m in a unique situation where this is my last “real” quarter of classes, as in my last quarter where i will be attending classes in-person. i have finished all of the requirements for my degree and major, and i could have technically applied to graduate after winter quarter. however, i will be taking a full-time credit course load in the spring for two reasons: to finish one of my two minors (only one class remaining) and to be able to receive an additional quarter of the generous financial aid that has essentially paid me to attend school. so, i will only be taking one class for one of my two optional minors i have added on, and the rest will just be fun and easy electives to hit the full time requirement for financial aid. 

all of these classes that i am taking are completely online, and my classes for winter quarter will be concluding at the beginning of march. as a result, i have been looking for full-time jobs starting immediately since i have the availability to begin my career early, and to get a head start versus having to compete with many more people who also will be graduating in june.

here’s my question: on my resume, i have been listing that i am graduating in march of 2024, since i will have technically met every single requirement for my degree, both general electives and my specific concentration, outside of the one optional minor. furthermore, i am afraid if i list june that employers will think i am not available until then and would reject my application thinking i don’t have the availability to start right away. this is something that if granted initial interviews, i plan on clarifying right away that while i could technically have my degree, on paper i technically do not, given the reasons above, but that i will in 3 months. i don’t want to “deceive” anyone, but given my unique situation i think i am better off putting march and then explaining my situation if i am provided an interview

i guess what i’m trying to ask is, is this okay to do? am i technically lying? i don’t want employers to possibly think i am trying to be deceitful or something of the sorts. i saw a tiktok about someone who lied and said they had a degree and they didn’t when they were technically 6 credits short. they had gone through 3 interviews without disclosing it, and had their offer rescinded as a result. i’m not sure if that person was still actively in school or not, but now it has left me paranoid. should i be putting june instead, even though i am able to start right now? any and all advice is greatly appreciated. thank you in advance!",advice

"list of tools and apps that make your student life easier. as a graduate, i realized there are many smart ways i should have utilized during my time in school to enhance productivity. i've come to understand that numerous tools exist that significantly simplify student life. allow me to share a few tools here that can aid you (especially freshmen and sophomores) in navigating your student life.

notion and timetable: these are essential tools for organizing your life. if you spend enough time scrolling through tiktok (i know you do), and you're unaware of these tools, you've been living under a rock. utilize these tools and search for tutorials on youtube about how to effectively use them as a student.

remnote: another must-have tool. this application employs common study methods to enhance your studying experience. it assists in creating flashcards and applying evidence-based memory techniques. don't just take my word for it—look it up on youtube; you won't regret it.

insight trunk newsletter: ever feel left out when conversing with friends who seem to know everything? look up this newsletter on google and make it a habit to read. they provide 10-minute reads on various topics that you can peruse on the bus, during breakfast, or before sleeping. two years from now, you'll become the smartest person in your friend group.

myfitnesspal: now, let's move on to health. first up is myfitnesspal, which helps you track your caloric intake. simply use this app to scan whatever you purchase, and you'll know how many calories you're consuming. it's an excellent choice for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

fitbod: this one is optional. if money isn't an issue and you can afford a personal trainer, that's fantastic! if not, fitbod is a more affordable alternative. it tailors a fitness program based on your weight, height, age, and other factors.

classpass: another important aspect of student life is socializing. while classes should be your priority, this app helps you join multiple local fitness classes. instead of sticking to one place, you now have the opportunity to explore various classes, increasing your chances of meeting new people who share your hobbies.

isavemoney: this is a budgeting app, but honestly, any budgeting app will work. this one is my personal choice.",student life

luckily for me, i applied to both american and canadian institutions at that time. i was also accepted by queen's university in canada. and during the time when i took the online courses from uw, i successfully received my canadian student visa, which is kind of a relief for me.

but for me queen's university is good but it is not like udub which has a superiority in stem and cs over almost all universities you can imagine(excluding some top schools, like stanford, and berkeley). i still hope to go there. and that is why i kept taking online courses from uw while i was registered at another university. i still have the opportunity to transfer here without filling out a returning student form or reapply.

so far i had a party on our last day of quiz section and baked cookies. students also brought food. this friday i invited my students out to get some drinks and most are coming! my goal is to break the power barrier between students and tas because we (tas) were undergrads once and i think we are a valuable resource and want my students to always feel comfortable asking me questions/sharing their experiences.

in the case that it isn't possible, i'll probably email the professor to ask about the readings (it's a literature class) and look into the content independently, but if it was possible, i'd much rather have the structure of a class to help me move through/process the content. just thought i may as well ask ",academics

i had a 3.85 gpa my freshman and sophomore year with 1 ap and 1 honors class but i started the running start program my junior year which lowered my gpa😭 when i applied to uw my accumulative gpa is 3.45 (ik it’s pretty bad and it’s not weighted) but i took all classes needed to get my associates degree in business. i took all 3 sets of acct, 2 classes of econ, stats, bus law, etc. i’m set to finish all my requirements next quarter.

i have did not submit my sat scores, not sure if that hinders my decision. i have 7 extracurriculars such as president of key club for two years, member of fbla and honors society, i tutored my junior year and did varsity cheerleading while coaching on the side. i got a job the second i turned 16 and have a pretty good essay from what people have told me.

i’m kind of worried because my gpa isn’t great but overall i’m pretty well rounded, i’m just scared because the previous years have been extremely competitive. what do you guys think?😪

"what are my chances of getting admitted? i am an in state student with a 3.1 gpa. no sat/act. both of my parents have a graduate degree from uw. i took challenging ap classes in my 11th and 12th grade year, including engl 101 comp (college cred class) where i earned a b+. i go to the #1 feeder school for uw in my state.

my extra curriculars: 4 years of varsity basketball & track, where i was captain for both sports during 2 of the years. aau circuit basketball for 4 years. music studio internship. i worked at a construction company. i worked at a restaurant. i volunteered. and i did a foreign exchange program in costa rica.

i am very confident in my personal statement because of the high grade i earned on my personal statement assignment from my engl 101 teacher who is notorious for being a very harsh grader. i got one of the best scores in my school.

i explained in the additional essay that the reason why my gpa is so low, is because i failed 4 classes in the second semester of 10th grade. this was due to my father passing away, and my brother being sent to a psychiatric ward for schizophrenia due to him being very violent.

on top of this, when i came back to school in 11th grade, i earned straight a’s in all of my classes. and prior to second semester of 10th grade, i was a a/ high b student.

"psa for admitted first years about majors congratulations all incoming huskies! 

every year there is some confusion about majors and applying to uw, and i’m seeing some of that here, so i hope this can clear some things up.

when you applied for uw and selected your intended major, if you are admitted that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re actually in the major. only a select number of majors have the potential for incoming first years to be directly admitted, and those are listed at the attached link. most majors at uw do not allow for direct admit, so if you selected any of those majors on your application as your intended major and were admitted, you were admitted to uw as major undeclared, and may be noted as “pre-major”, “pre-sciences”, “pre-health”, or “pre-art” in your portal, all of these mean you don’t have a major.

psychology for example does not have direct admit, so if you selected psychology and were admitted, you are not actually in the psychology major. you would need to look up psychology’s pre-requisites, complete those courses, and apply once you’re here. some majors are selective and competitive to get into, some only have minimum requirements that as long as you complete those you’re admitted, and some majors are open, meaning there are no pre-reqs and you can declare at any time.

please just be aware during your planning for your first year that there are some steps you may need to take in order to actually get into your major, and plan to take those pre-reqs as soon as possible. uw is different than other schools that will typically admit you into your major when you’re admitted to the school, but uw more often than not will admit only to the school and not directly to any major. 

i hope this clears some things up!

"unsure about retaking a math class so i just got my final back for a class i thought i did good in only to see i got 10 points below the average with a max score of 60. this was in math 300 and i knew it was going to be confusing but i went to every lecture except for one and used office hours and frequently asked questions in class and was doing relatively well on the homeworks but seeing that final grade might not only rank my overall grade but hit my confidence as well.

i should clarify by saying that i wanted to do a minor in math and am declaring geography data science next quarter and am a second year. the only other math class i took on campus was diffeq and i got a 2.6 in that as i just never really understood some of the content. i’m essentially trying to figure out if i am the problem and maybe i shouldn’t be taking these math classes or it’s worth giving it another shot as i am planning on doing linear algebra next quarter and i expect that to be a challenge.

"oos affordability (or lack there of) and general advice hi, i just got admitted as an oos applicant into pre social science. i have like a billion questions, so advice on any of them would be greatly appreciated.

in terms of oos affordability, wtf is the deal? i got $4200 from the purple and gold scholarship, so that covers a tiny bit (tysm so so generous 😭) but what am i looking at for total cost? i would look into this on my own but i’m honestly so confused on varying sticker prices. i have around 60k (probably a little less) in college savings, but i know that’s not going to cover all four years, maybe not even one. does the university give any more money based on the fafsa? or am i totally screwed? my fafsa is already messed up because the 2022 information is before my father quit his job and went off the deep-end leaving me in a single income divorced family situation so idk the expected contribution. i think my mom makes around 100k a year but she really only got our house and the cars in the divorce so there’s not a ton of equity there. 

with the financial context set, assuming uw is even an option, how does applying to majors work? this quirky system scares me because i am wholly unsure of my future career and major. i like political science but would probably go to law school after because there’s not a lot of jobs there (especially that pay well). i also like biology and anthropology but don’t want to be in academia. i’m hoping that i’ll find a career that pairs my interests in a way that also pays off my debt lmfao. with my uncertainty in mind, wtf do i do my freshman year. it seems like you have to be proactive about taking prereqs for the majors and that they’re competitive and i feel like it’ll be hard to compete when i literally don’t know where i’ll be competing.

this is a more general question about college trade-offs, but is it really worth it to go somewhere that feels boring and unfulfilling if it’s the cheapest option? i got into umn with honors (i’d have little to no debt there), but it’s only 5 hours from home and i need to get out of the midwest lol. i also found out my ex is going there and i honestly feel like my growth would be stunted if i’m surrounded in the same environment that i’m trying to escape right now. that sounds a little dramatic but the past two years of my life have been hell and this girl embodies all of that suffering lol. also, this is 100% an ego thing, but i’ve worked so hard and academics have been the foundation of my self worth my whole life and i’m going to be dissapointed if i end up at a college half of my hs class goes to.

"should i contact admissions? recently i got accepted into uw computer science. however, im a little worried about my course schedule. when i applied to uw, i mentioned i would take econ and accounting (along with math, physics, etc.). im running start, so i said i would take econ 201, 202, accounting 201, 202, 203. in the spring, winter, and possibly summer quarters. however, when i took accounting this past winter quarter, i realized that business is not something i wanted to pursue, and i don't want to take them. however, this world be a discrepancy in what i said and what i did. also i had to drop out of accounting this winter (gpa dd not get affected but did show as a w in the transcript) due to family concerns.

not to trauma dump, but for a fuller a picture, in my junior year my dad died which messed up my grades quite a bit. i am a running start student and from what i remember i got one n/c, one d, and one c-. the rest were a's and b's. gpa dropped from 4.0 to i believe a 3.6. 

with those grades i still somehow managed to get accepted for marine bio for the 2024 autumn quarter. 

with that this year has been equally a struggle (due to some extra family issues that were caused from my dads passing) i got two c's fall quarter and i believe i will either be getting a d or an n/c (depending on which i decide to take) and a b for winter quarter. my gpa, without winter quarters grades, is currently a 3.4. 

i have reason to believe that the rest of this year i will get a's and b's as all i'm really taking next quarter are pe classes because that's i still need for grad credits. 

i've talked to my therapist and she says she'll write a letter explaining my current situation which we have reason to believe will improve considerably after i move to college. 

i am fully aware that i messed up big and this is fully on me, no excuses. i know that i will probably get a letter asking what happened. what i really want to know is what has it taken for people to get rescinded in the past and how screwed am i really? i know there will be no guarantees but i just want some form of confirmation on my chances.

i always knew the community college transfer route is a great path, but further research made it seem like it's in fact an amazing path.

the main thing keeping me from attending another 4-year is cost savings. not just living from home, but my lenient chill job pays me $24/hour, so staying home while keeping that job could have great financial outcomes. plus, it seems that as long as i maintain good performance in terms of gpa and activities, i may have an excellent chance at ece.",advice

"ucsb vs uw seattle i am stuck between ucsb vs uw seattle. i got into ucsb for pre-economics & accounting, and uw seattle as a direct admit to the foster school of business. i am a california resident but cost isn't that much of an issue.

**school: ucsb vs uw**

us news rank: 35 vs 40

acceptance rate: 29% vs 46%

total cost per year: 40k vs 60k (oos)

location: beach town vs big city

student-faculty ratio: 17:1 vs 21:1

overall, ucsb appears better in every meaningful statistic, however, the specific program is what i am more curious about. in 2023, uw foster's starting salary for undergrads was 76.6k in 2023 with a 94% placement after 3 months, and the average signing bonus was 8.5k. this makes it significantly better than uw overall.

on the other hand, ucsb pre-economics & accounting major has very little data available online and feels like a bit more of a gamble. does anyone have any data on ucsb accounting major? i am leaning towards foster since their mba is ranked 20th on us news (which is still relevant to the undergraduate program) and since i have concrete data on outcomes. some data on ucsb's accounting/econ program and any possible first-hand experience would be super helpful before making a decision.

extra: i have also been waitlisted by michigan and ucsd and was wondering how they would stack up in case i am offered a spot. i am also considering getting an mba in the future and am not sure how that would impact my decision, i am assuming it won't but not i am not sure what mba admissions are like.",admissions

i use a cane as a mobility aid and have to get a basket if i pick up more than like 2 items—i constantly have people walk into me or avoid me because of my cane and the fact that i can’t walk normally like everyone else. it’s difficult for me to get the motivation/energy around my chronic pain and classes to go in the first place and i’m constantly really nervous and uncomfortable there.

not only that but when i go, i go for my weekly groceries because it’s difficult to go every day—and the employees constantly comment on how much i am buying? but i have to, otherwise they won’t give me a bag and i have to struggle to get my groceries back to my dorm. one time, i brought my own bag and they rushed me to get out of there— so much so that while i was trying to put my groceries in my bag (one handed—again, it’s difficult to do things standing with my cane in the other hand supporting me), i dropped a thing of blueberries and had to pick them up by myself, crying and in pain, while another student shoved around me to check out where my groceries were still sitting. 

the north campus dm is even worse, because they do not even have baskets at all. imagine if i was living there and just needed to get more than the two items i can carry in one arm!

"math credit waived for taking higher level class? i’m in a really dumb situation that i put myself in and i so desperately need guidance or advice. i had math 125/126 credit from running start, and throughout college i took math 207/207/224 for my degree. note …. i did not have math 124 credit because of some technicalities. i (stupidly) assumed that eventually i could get it waived somehow, so i put off even dealing with the credit until now as a senior.

last quarter i went to my advisors and asked for waiver, and while they seemed somewhat hopeful that it would get waived they eventually got back to me and informed me that it isn’t able to be waived. and not only that, i’m not eligible to take the course for credit at uw because the math department has a rule about taking a lower-level class for credit … so my only option would have been to take it at a community college or to take a higher level course (either math 209, or upper level amath course, etc) for substitution. i tried looking into a local community college but that would have been ~$1000 i would have had to pay out of pocket for, which i can’t afford, so i tried sucking it up and taking one of the amath courses this quarter.

it’s just not going well for me. the course is so difficult and beyond my understanding or interest. i go to class, and i review the notes but a single problem takes me 1-2 hours just to create a gameplan and understand what to do. my professor’s office hours was full with almost a third of the class there too, and others have made comments about our first homework’s difficulty. i’m also just going through so much in life right now, like i just broke up with my long-term partner of 4 years and now i have to go through the process of moving back home. other stuff also going on in my life but honestly the breakup is the one hitting pretty hard. 

i thought i could just deal with this but to be honest i can’t. this is really difficult for me. maybe i’m being entitled but i was shocked that the solution was to take a significantly higher-level course for credit that i otherwise wouldn’t have been expected to take. 

has anyone ever been in a situation like this before? does anyone have advice? i was thinking of going to the math department’s advising hours tomorrow and asking them directly for help since i haven’t done that yet. i knownit’s such a dumb situation i did to myself, and i need to deal with the consequences, but i’m feeling so hopeless because i don’t think i can do this.",advice

"dropping class with an a? we had a major project in a course due this week and i got it back and received a ~93. while this is a good score, i strongly disagree with the points taken off. some of the points lost were due to things out of my control, or i feel like the professor was not clear in their own instruction. the rubric was super vague and i tried my best given the little time we had to prepare or understand the material (it’s only the third week of the quarter). 

this whole situation left me with a really bad feeling for the rest of the quarter. i’m worried that i will continue to be graded arbitrarily and will remain frustrated with the course. 

i believe i’m still within the time frame to drop a class, however i feel really dumb dropping a class where i am currently at about a 98%. am i being overly sensitive or am i correct in getting out early before there are serious impacts due to the grading system? i’m worried about the grading getting more and more unreasonable as the course progresses and new content gets introduced.

"transferring to uw seattle from 4 year (umich)? hey all,

i’m a freshman and international student currently in umich and i do not really like the environment, culture and people here that much and even the cs department here is a little weird. overall i don’t feel happy or academically fulfilled here.

after some research i am super motivated in transferring to uw seattle because of location, better connections and stronger cs program and the transfer acceptance rate is not as low as other prestigious universities. i am also a cs and stats double major.

i currently have a 3.72 gpa. i know my chances at uw cs are altar super low so i don’t how hopeful be because i really want to transfer out of umich and into uw and i am willing to try my absolute best to stand out. should i also apply for stats or math major for higher chances?

i applied for this admission cycle and was directly admitted to chemistry in the college of arts and sciences. given the relatively early deadline of uw, i was not completely sure of my major at the time although i was sure it was going to be either chemistry or chemical engineering. so i applied as a chemistry major without giving it much thought, but i decided i was going to pursue engineering a while after i applied to uw. now that i am accepted and uw actually it’s one of my top choices, i realize that i should’ve applied as an engineering major if i wanted to pursue cheme. hence my questions are, can direct admits change their major after enrolling? if so, how difficult would be for me to change my major from chemistry to cheme? and how competitive is it to get directly admitted to chemistry? i am an international student, if it’s a factor.

"experience with classics major at uw? i'll be completely honest in that i wasn't the smartest planner when i took community college classes to get my aa degree whilst in high school and rarely took classes that i had checked would transfer well as prerequisites for my intended majors: psychology and english. so when i was done with cc, i looked and realized i could only apply to get a degree that had no prerequisites. even english had a long list of prerequisite classes i had never taken. i'm pretty stupid for not preparing. i also don't intend to waste more money on taking those prerequisites at the cc, i am not in the financial position to do that and then wait another year for admission at uw. 

for a little context i will be a lawyer, and i just knew i would take a major that was focused in humanities and arts and then head out to law school. so i chose classics(as a transfer) and will start this year. 

so now i'm curious on what to expect for this major. i love history and reading so i'm not worried i won't like it, but i wonder, what type of people take these classes? it was clearly not my intended major and i don't know anyone that's taken a major like this, it's even more ""out there"" than philosophy. 

i know i sound ignorant asking ""who takes this major"" really i just want to hear if some of you have had great experiences with this major. i'm fresh out of high school by the way. ",discussion

also, i personally feel like the vibes of shows has changed. they use to all be about inclusivity and being yourself and i use to have a lot of fun at them and enjoyed talking to people, but i feel like the last couple times i've gone to the bakery i have felt very unwelcomed and like no one wants to talk to me. one clear thing i have noticed is people dress up way more for the shows, i feel like i can't just wear what i wore to class that day anymore. i have to put on some elaborate trend setting outfit with cool eyeliner just for people to not cut me i the bathroom line. i understand self expression, but its gotten to a point where it feels like i have to perform and present a certain way just to attend. honestly it feels like i'm back in high school except in high school i was too queer for the cool kids and now i feel like i don't present queer enough, but now all the cool kids are bi in a het relationship and don't like the word lesbian because it ""sounds too harsh"".
