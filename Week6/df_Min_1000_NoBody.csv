"revised study advice **foreword:**

because some people have contacted me privately and legitimately thought my advice was helpful i am putting a toned down version here. i will elaborate more in the comment section.


**grading system:**

for curved classes, the median grade will be fixed to a certain gpa. for most weed out courses this will be in the 2.8 to 3.1 range. in a class of 200 about 4-6 people will receive a 4.0, 6-8 a 3.9, and so on up to about 20-25 receiving a gpa in the 3.5 range. this means to get a 3.5+ gpa you will need to be in the top 30% of your class.


**maintaining focus:**

a common complaint is that students are spending lots of time studying but with no payoff. when you study you will need to achieve a point of focus. put away your distractions and stay put at a desk and when you take a break only do it to use the restroom or take a quick bite. refrain from doing activities that have the potential to distract you. i personally recommend staying at a desk for 4 hours at a time. two 2 hours sessions without getting up with a break in between should work as well. at first you will feel bored and will not be able to concentrate. that is normal. push through it, and eventually you will be able to ""zone out"" and study effectively.


**in regards to lectures, textbooks, and videos:**

for the weed out classes i personally think the textbook is all you really need. yes learning form a textbook can be hard and confusing that is all part of the process. as things become more complex, your textbook is going to become your main source of information so i think getting used to it is going to be of great benefit. as for lectures there's really no point in showing up unless you are going to actively follow along and take notes (preferably handwritten). and finally, i think people should use youtube videos cautiously as they can be a time consuming and passive way to learn that works out to be not as effective long term.


**what to study:**

a lot of people think that studying consists of reviewing notes and reading the textbook. while this is a good way to start, it really only gives a lay of the land. you will need to do what is called active learning in order to be able to tackle the wide range of problems professors will throw at you. i recommend forming a study group with regular meeting times so that everyone is held accountable. each person should create problems in the form of a scenario that uses a concept from the class. refrain from asking simple things like ""what is x"", but rather aim for ""something y is being affected by object z, why is that?"". the process of forming questions and discussing the answer with others i found to be highly effective.",academics

"should i stay at uw (neuro) i'm currently a sophomore (soon to be junior) majoring in biology, and i recently got accepted to ucsd as a transfer majoring in neurobiology. i also plan to minor in applied math (have taken 301 and am planning on taking 3 more classes), and chemistry (if possible). currently i have a 3.5 overall gpa, with a 3.3 average across the bio series, so i think my chances at the neuroscience major are somewhat slim. however, i have had a year's worth of research experience in a neuroscience lab, and i've been involved in some neuroscience related clubs for quite a while (i'm also president of a non-neuro/bio rso). is it worth staying at uw, considering i probably won't get into the neuroscience major? how much does the major (biology vs. neuroscience) matter for graduate school (what i'm leaning towards) and/or medical school (something i'm considering but am not entirely sure of)? i'd like to do something with neuroscience in graduate school, so that might be important.   


currently the factors that are keeping me staying are: i have leadership positions at uw, uw has better/more neuroscience related clubs for undergrads, i have another lab lined up at uw that's very undergrad friendly/good for my transition into independent research, i can have minor(s) at uw, and uw might be better for my gpa because i can take less classes/have a less intense schedule.   


the factors encouraging me to transfer are: tuition (i'm a ca resident), weather, major (neurobiology vs biology), and the fact that ucsd is super good for neuro.  


considering everything, is it worth staying? what would you do, or if you've been in this situation, what did you do?

now that registration is right around the corner, i started looking at the schedule my advisor suggest i take (ee 233, ee 235, ee 393), but all the professors have terrible rmp ratings, times are really messed up, and they just seem to be extensions of ee 215, which i'm not enjoying.

"from cheating in cse 143 to a full time programming role **as i am seeing that many admission decisions are coming out i thought now would be a good time to share the (success) story of my journey at uw, which is coming to an end this quarter.**

  
like many hopefuls i came into the uw hoping to do computer science. i had built my own computer in high school, i thought coding was fascinating, i saw that it was a field that was employable and paid well. like many up until i started at uw i didn't really realize the work it took to be successful, and i wasn't prepared for the competitive nature that uw cultivates. 

by the end of **my first year** i knew i would never be a cs student. i took cse 143 that winter with my roommate, we were both struggling on an assignment and he sent me an ""example"" of a past quarter's submission found online. as i soon found out, you can change every single variable name and you will still get caught. the program they run is able to see the structure of the code and compares it to their database of submissions. that crushed me, and was one of the hardest lessons i had to learn my freshman year. having to own up to my own mistake and look past it shook my world for the better. we both got caught and i don't blame my roommate at all.

i was able to finish the prerequisite courses to informatics just in time to apply my freshman year. i wrote a piss-poor essay which i was revising with 10 minutes left to the deadline. in retrospect of course i'm not surprised at all that i wasn't admitted, but at the time i was still partially in the mindset that life would just work out for me. 

after getting rejected my **sophomore year** with an actually well written and revised essay i was heartbroken. in my head i still was set on info as my backup major and didn't have another backup, i didn't have the prerequisites or grades for acms or any math heavy major. a friend of mine had recommended gis in geography as a tech-related alternative and by the end of the year i was a declared geography major. i still wanted to program for a living and still was hoping to get into info my junior year. i had it calculated that i could take info classes on the side and still graduate in 4 years if i was admitted then.

so many students i see on this sub-reddit put an incredible emphasis on getting into their major. which is a great goal to work towards, but it isn't the ""end all be all""! i finally came to realize around this point that *my major wasn't what was going to get me that desired job after college, it was the skills was able to gain and retain from my studies*. this was when i got my first internship paying minimum wage at a research center downtown to help add data visualizations to their website. i got this through applying to nearly every data science related *undergraduate research program listing.*

for my **junior year** informatics essay i was actually so ticked at the system that my essay was about how my major and grades don't define my capabilities in life. haha! long story short i didn't get in then either, and was officially going to be graduating as a geography major. i continued to take informatics and the non-major cse courses that i was able to get into and began applying like crazy to internship roles for the next summer. i likely *applied to over 100 roles mostly on sites like glassdoor*. i got my second internship at a recreational equipment company working on their employee management system/database. around this time i also secured a part-time engineering internship at a telecommunications giant that would go throughout my senior school year. when i applied and accepted these internships my resume still had informatics as my intended major even though i was denied from the program a few weeks afterwards. 

this might apply to tech more than other majors but *don't think that because you didn't get into your major you aren't qualified or able to get that role you want or be successful in the future*. fight through it and apply everywhere! **work experience is so much more valuable than any major title or course.** 

the geography major is not incredibly technical and even though i'm seeing this data science option that has been recently added to it, after looking at the courses, it's not that much more intensive. geography courses all hold your hand through the material and if you do major in i highly recommend going above and beyond. i was able to take every single non-major cse course except for ai and the photography one. in informatics i was able to get the android, ios, and server-side courses (don't take professionalism), many people assumed i was in the major.

for a while i regretted not transferring when the geography major initially disappointed me, but in retrospect two factors made staying worth it, the reduced in-state tuition (probably saved over $50,000 in debt), and simply *the amount of opportunities in seattle*. all my internships were located in seattle and being able to be at school so close gave me the opportunities to go to interviews (of which i got rejected from many) and eventually find internships. 

this summer i start work full time as a diagnostics engineer writing programs that monitor and help to maintain cell phone service around the country, i get to work with massive amounts of data, and am making a 6 figure salary right out of college. to everyone who has been rejected from any major, know that it isn't the end of the world and you can and will bounce back. stay positive and fail forward.",advice

"""easy 4.0"" classes review - winter and spring 2020 i was thinking this would help you all with future class registrations. this school year i took a few of the suggested easy classes on our megathreads and i'm here to provide an updated review. this includes psych 101, ais 103, ais 270, and drama 215.  


**winter 2020:**  


**• (i&s, 5 cr) psych 101 w/ judith l. mclaughlin:** honestly, i loved every second of this class. mclaughlin is so sweet. she was always open to scheduling meetings outside of office hours if there was a time conflict with my classes. the tas also had office hours. in terms of grading, she graded based off of 3 online assignments (for completion), poll everywhere in-class questions (for completion), and 4 non-cumulative multiple-choice exams. i was also able to raise my grade up to a maximum of 0.3 gpa points by participating in psychology studies outside of class (as the test subject). for the workload, i spent around 2 hours studying and reviewing notes everyday and got a 4.0. i didn't find it necessary to read everything in the textbook; she provided a study guide for us to focus on specific concepts and sections. her exam questions gave a scenario and we needed to match it to a concept we learned in class. given this, we didn't need to do that much rote memorization since she gave similar scenarios in her lectures. unfortunately, i never fully paid attention (my own fault) so i just made quizlet sets to remember the concepts. you can find them here if you want to get a feel for the content: [https://quizlet.com/kpolful](https://quizlet.com/kpolful)  


overall, i wouldn't call it an ""easy 4.0"" since you need to put a good amount of effort in every week to get one. for perspective, she revealed the score spread after every test and only 30-40% of the class consistently got above 90%. however, it's definitely an easy 3.5+.  


**• (i&s & div, 5 cr) ais 103 w/ dian million:** imagine the coolest aunt you could ever ask for. that's dian. lectures consisted of dian telling stories about her inspiring indigenous origin and watching films. our work consisted of four ""quizzes"" that each had around 5 long answer questions (250-500 words each). they're based on 3-20 page readings she posts to canvas. why quizzes is in quotation marks is because we had 2 weeks to answer them. there was also an assignment for us to go to burke to research indigenous artifacts and a final art project to convey our emotions for a topic we learned during the quarter (graded on completion).  


""easy 4.0"" approved. although she's not teaching for fall quarter 2020, i'm sure any introductory ais class will be similar in workload.  


**spring 2020 (keep in mind the online format may have significantly affected the workload):**  


**• (i&s & div, 5 cr) ais 270 w/ charlotte cote:** imagine your other coolest aunt. that's charlotte. our work consists of interacting with two discussion boards and a final quiz. charlotte explicitly said she was planning on assigning two quizzes but kept it to one because of how much stress we're going through. bless her soul. in the discussion boards you have to write an answer to questions related to the lectures and readings (similar to ais 103) in around 500-600 words total. after that, you post a question and respond to three other classmates. we're getting an entire week to work on the final quiz so i assume it's also long answer.  


""easy 4.0"" approved (online)  


**• (vlpa, 5 cr) drama 215 w/ skip mercier:** this was never mentioned, but somebody should add this to the list of easy 4.0s. skip is passionate about set/costume design and always strives to pass on that passion to his students. did you know he worked on plays for alice in wonderland and finding nemo? seriously, cool guy. it seems this class is fairly new and shows up every spring quarter. every week we have a few assignments (1-3) that have us test and improve our skills with a new concept of theater design. some examples include drawing a building with the use of perspective and drawing our own rube goldberg machine. there's also a final group project. it's all graded on completion so...

once the registration office puts informatics as my major beginning autumn will that remove my registration hold or is there anything extra i need to do?

"questions about physics 141 and cs 300 level for freshman schedule. hello,

i am incoming freshman cs major to uw, and have been contemplating possible schedules for fall quarter. 

currently, i’m considering

math 134
physics 141
some english gen-ed currently unknown

i have a couple of questions, the two big ones being
1. is it worth taking physics 141? i am set on math 134, but debating if physics 141 will be a good fit. my reasoning for considering it:

- i like physics, and the regular intro series will have some repeat material from high school but i don’t get credit to skip it, and i’ve heard 12x is horrid. 
- i would significantly prefer a harder and  more time consuming class that is interesting than one which is straight busy work and weedouty. i haven’t been able to find out if the new physics 141 or the honors version of 121 are signficant improvements over normal 121 (if honors is still weedouty or a very large time increase, i will probably not take it, so experience here is really appreciated!)
- it will only be worth it to me if its actually a different class. like math 134 is really different from 124-126, but if phys 141 is just more convoluted problems rather than more interesting problems, its a huge turnoff.

my second question is: 
2. should i take a cs class first quarter? math is a must, and i’d love a physics class, but cs is first priority long term(4 years). its the short term i’m debating

my reasoning for not taking a cs class first quarter are:
- i will have credit for cs 143, so i have a bit of breathing room to take some other classes i want to take first quarter (like physics and math) and start 300s in winter.
- the workload seems daunting. college will be a big transition even without the possibility of online classes in the fall, and it might be better to save my core foundational major classes for the winter after i’ve adapted a bit in. also, 3 stem is already hard i’ve heard, let alone honors.

these have led me to decide between the previously said schedule above, an alternative with cs instead of physics, or an extreme workload one.

math 134
a useful cs 300 class (351,331,341 depending on whats available to me)
some english class


math 134
cs 300 class
physics 141

so what are your thoughts? comments that provide anecdotal experience with any of the classes above or advice backed up by some form of evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, are really appreciated. i’m set on math 134 because i’ve talked to friends with experience, but i haven’t been able to find that with phys 141 or the previous honors section of 121, so i’m lost on that front.

"i need some advice as a preface, i would like to acknowledge that there are multiple things i could have done along the way to prevent this and also to take full responsibility for my mistakes.

last september i was accepted to uw and directly admitted to foster as a freshman. i did running start and was able to complete almost all of the required lower division classes. as a result, i’ve had the opportunity to complete my degree (finance) within 2 years, which i am currently working towards.

under my current plan, assuming nothing major changes, i am on track to graduate next spring. this would normally be great if it were not for the fact that i don’t have an internship this summer and will be graduating without ever securing one. doing running start was great, but applying to summer finance positions as a small town high school student made it very difficult to secure an internship then.

when i was admitted into uw at the fall, i was admittedly overwhelmed with all the networking and recruiting and was a bit of a mess. eventually, i got things sorted out, granted later than most, but was able to get an internship offer. although i got an offer, i ended up turning it down. i turned the offer down because 1) i was still talking with several other recruiters and things looked promising and 2) i had a very short timeline to decide on the offer without the opportunity to postpone. unfortunately, things didn’t work out with the other companies and in the end, i have been left without an offer.

it would definately lower my overall gpa. should i pull the trigger on the s/ns or does that look worse than a 3.0-3.2 on a transcript? i know from previous posts that an s is regarded as basically a 2.0 but given the circumstances is it any different? *note im already in my major but im concerned if it will affect finding jobs or possibly grad school which im still uncertain about.",advice

"cc courses to sub for courses at uw seattle? (incoming freshman advice) pre-science: acms (engineering + physical sciences/scna) and applied mathematics (new major)

hi all, i was wondering if any of you could advice me on something. i was considering taking some cc courses (for math 126 and cse 143) but now i’m not sure because 1. i missed the deadline for summer 2020 and 2. i heard that for acms, the gpa that i receive from my cc courses doesn’t appear on my transcript. 

thus, i wonder if 1. i should still take them in fall 2020 for the same courses or not? 2. would it be wise to take cc courses for math 126 and cse 143 considering they’re program core courses? if not, then which courses should i sub w/ cc credits?",academics
"potential uw freshman questions hi! i’m looking at/applying to colleges soon and uw seems to be one of the schools i’ll most likely end up at. i’m from the seattle area right near uw so my parents are really pushing for me to go to uw and live at home to save money. i’m pretty social and love meeting new people and hanging out, but i’m still super worried because i’ve heard that the social life is not great at uw especially if you don’t live right on campus or join greek life, and i’m not that interested in joining a sorority. 
so i just wanted to hear some opinions about parties and making friends as a freshman if you don’t live in the dorms or go greek, because honestly i feel like it would make for a very depressing college experience and i would hate it :( 
basically, i’m not sure if i should save money and sacrifice my social life and happiness by living at home, or if it is worth it to dorm freshman year.

"sevp requires nonimmigrant international students to leave the country if taking all online courses in autumn a friend of mine just shared [this broadcast message](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during) with me and i was really shocked reading it. an important takeaway is:

>nonimmigrant students within the united states are not permitted to take a full course of study through online classes. if students find themselves in this situation, they must leave the country or take alternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant status such as a reduced course load or appropriate medical leave.

&#x200b;

update: found [this more detailed document](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcm2007-01.pdf). it specifically states that:

>for the fall 2020 semester, continuing f and m students outside of the united state, whose schools of enrollment are only offering online classes, may remain in active status in sevis if they are taking online courses and are able to meet the normal full course of study requirements or the requirements for a reduced course of study. only students enrolled at a school that is only offering online coursework can engage in remote learning from their home country. in this case, dsos should annotate the student’s record to make it clear that the student is outside the us but taking full time online courses as that is the only choice offered by the school.

as per this, it seems like there would be two cases:

1) if uw went completely online, then all nonimmigrant international students must leave the united states;

2) if uw remained hybrid, then all nonimmigrant international students who are currently outside the united states must stay in the states for autumn quarter to maintain their status.

well, i'm failing really bad right now. i got a 51/100 on the first test and my professor's had to give me so many accommodations already because i missed the first quiz and a discussion post. at this rate, i'd be lucky to get a 1.7. none of this is curved. the emails i get from the professor always sound so passive aggressive, and he doesn't sound like he trusts me very much because of how much he's had to go out of his way for me. i just feel... deflated.

i've been debating on dropping the class. the deadline to drop the class and get any sort of refund on tuition was the 13th, so if i drop, i lose about $600. i still haven't paid for webassign. the trial ended yesterday, so i can't even check my grades, and there's an assignment due tonight. if i drop, i won't have to pay for webassign. if i try to tough this out, i'll have to fork over for webassign and have to rush to finish the assignment today, while i might not even pass the class.

i asked a psych advisor today, and he said i can afford to wait until next summer to take calc again, which is great to hear. but i don't know how next summer will look for me. i may not even be in the country to take classes. and even then, i live kind of far away from any community colleges as it is, which means i'd have to find a place that offers online calc classes that are transferable to uw.

every da i talked to were taking classes like cse 311, 331, math 126, 308, etc. and i felt shame saying i'm only taking math 120 and english 131 my first quarter. i felt so disconnected from the rest of the da's because they took higher level classes than i did.

when i took cse 142 and 143, there were so many dedicated students who knew more than i did who were trying to get into cse themselves. a couple of those people told me i don't deserve to be in cs.

all these weedout classes have such a gloomy atmosphere to it. and all of them are curved. i want to learn and track my progress. i don't want to be compared to others. it hurts to know that even tho im doing fairly well, other people are failing the classes because of the competiveness. i hate weedout classes and taking them has really hurt my mental health.

seeing all these denied from cs posts on reddit and seeing how they have 4.0's in weedout classes and how they have all these cse extracurriculars but still got rejected makes me feel unqualified. i don't have any cse extracurriculars and i have a around 3.5 gpa currently.

i'm ashamed of my resume and my college numbers. i tried very hard and work tirelessly for  my 3.4+ in my math and cs classes at udub. i don't have cs extracurriculars, i had very little cs knowledge coming into this school. i came to udub and had cs as my first choice major because i wanted to start learning computer science.

im taking summer quarter, i have a projected 2.5 in biol 180 and i had a poor score on my first math midterm this qtr. i very ashamed because of this. i don't think i'll get good grades this quarter.

"help with picking classes for freshman (figs) hi,

i'm an incoming freshman and a foster admit. i'm not sure which online classes to sign up for especially for the upcoming fall quarter. i'm not that strong at math or science but i need to knock out the english requirement, microecon (econ 200), and math requirement but i don't know when i should take them in addition to taking figs? is there a figs cluster that you recommend taking that combines easier and fun courses that fulfills any of these requirements?

i'm thinking of taking the ""taking your first steps in business"" fig which includes: **engl 111** f: composition: literature, **math 111** b: algebra with applications, and **math 111 ba** (all worth 12 credits)? is that doable along with taking drama 101 for fall quarter? then taking math 112 winter quarter and econ 200 spring quarter or winter??

is there a benefit to just taking a fig with the gen st 199 and one other class like econ 200 or is it worth more to just take a cluster of classes within a fig?

i'm also interested in the fig called ""future lawyers"" taught by fig leader: sam eden. **lsj 200** a: introduction to law, societies, and justice, lsj 200 af (quiz section), **engl 131** x4: composition: exposition, **gen st 297** w: pre-law 101. i'm kind of interested in law (although it's not my major) but would the workload for this fig be too much?

another fig i'm thinking about taking is ""future lawyers: introduction to law, societies, and justice and interdisciplinary writing"" which has **lsj 200:** intro to law, societies, and justice, lsj 200 ai (quiz section), and **engl 298** linked writing course: lsj 200. would the workload for this fig be too time consuming?

what about fig: ""understanding social problems"" with courses: **engl 298 g**: linked writing course: soc 270, **soc 270** a: social problems, and soc 270 ad (quiz section)?

second to last, what about fig: ""future lawyers: introduction to law, societies, and justice and interdisciplinary writing"" with courses: **lsj 200 a: introduction to law, societies, and justice**, lsj 200 ai (quiz section), and **engl 298 j: linked writing course**: lsj 200. would the workload for this fig be too much?

lastly, what about fig: ""understanding social problems"" with classes **engl 298 g: linked writing course:** soc 270, **soc 270 a: social problems,** and soc 270 ad (quiz section)? so far this fig is open for registration. would the amount of writing for these classes be too much??

&#x200b;

also, which english class do you recommend taking in terms of difficulty? is the english 131 class difficult? what about engl 121 and 111??

anyone have any tips to cope? is everyone here just insanely competitive and fast? will i have to peel my eyeballs everyday for every opportunity and to be able to get into the classes i need? will every meal have to be half a granola bar that i finish in 20 seconds before smashing my keyboard to (hopefully) get into a popular course? do people end up not graduating on time bc they couldn’t get into their necessary course on time? i was a top student at my previous university and have always been so from elementary to high school as well. but i am still lowkey scared. there’s just so. many. people. especially online! it was much more overwhelming than i initially imagined.. either way. i’m going to always give my best. and never give up.

"created a personal finance cash flow projection spreadsheet - uw themed for the upcoming school year! so...i have been utilizing a paid financial tool for a long time that allowed me to input financial events in a calendar that displayed projected account balances on each day of the month forecast however long in the future that i would like based on the expenses/income that i input. yesterday i had the thought that i could do this pretty easily in google sheets instead of paying a monthly fee. naturally as i was working, i thought to utilize uw's brand guidelines which led me to think that maybe, just maybe i could put it out there and help some people with financial woes for this upcoming year!

the spreadsheet is formatted like a yearly calendar. you can start by entering your starting balance for your savings/checking accounts at the top of the month of august tab (or if you're getting to this late, you can start in september). each day you can input as many as seven financial events, all sorted into checking expense/income or savings expense/income. each time you input a financial event, the balance at the bottom of each day will reflect that days events and any previous events. the first tab on the spreadsheet is an example of a months expenses and other features explained within a couple of cell notes (marked with a black triangle in the top right of a cell).

any questions/comments can be posted here and i will try to keep the sheet updated with anything that might be incorrect/needs improvement!

we're building a new feature that lets you listen to short snippets of wisdom and actionable advice, specific to your issues and challenges, from people who've stood where you're standing. you can think of it as 2-5 minute mini-podcasts for what you're going through today.

for user testing, we're looking for current students or people who graduated from uw within the last 12 months. this will be a \~45 minute call with out head of product, [chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robeck/), who will ask all sorts of random questions about mental health and audio listening, and we will compensate $10 for the call. we also have some longer term involvement options that we can touch base on at the end of the call.

i’ve read loads of posts here on the harsh curves for weedout stem series (i give you chem 142, which boasts a median gpa of 2.6-2.9), but i’m curious about grading for humanities/non-stem courses. i ask because

music 120 needs 96%+ for a 4.0

but then

engl 197 (interdisciplinary writing for w credit; tied to music 120) needs 99%+ for a 4.0

there is the option of finding a new major, however i already completed most of my general reqs for uw and the business school. this would mean giving up my dream of attending the business school and completing my bachelor’s degree by 2022.  

i can join an open major and try reapplying into the busines school, but i fear that i would not get in again. also, there is no open major i am exactly interested in. unless someone knows a certain open major that ties well with business.

i've noticed many of my high school classmates some of them failed a class, graduating uw, (those who failed a class in hs probably did running start, and did well in it and transferred to uw).

i don't belong here in washington or seattle, apparently the vibe here and i are completely opposite. if you knew me in real life, i guarantee you'd hate me. (serious) please don't post things like ""oh hate is a strong word"", please i've dealt with too many people who are either secretive, sugar coat things too much, or even bully.

i dropped out of uw because i flopped after 3 successful satisfactory academic progress appeals, and after failing the 4th quarter (i needed to pass all 3 classes, but only passed 2) the 4th appeal form was denied. (so its 4 strikes you're out not 3).
in case you're wondering the really hard classes that i struggled with is math 124, math 125, music 116, astr 101, pols 201.

i didn't go back to community college, because i was dealing with some minor case of ptsd. well not really the ptsd you understand from military but you know, bullying and racism at uw campus.

honestly, i did use all 4 years of grant money, and somehow i flopped. i did okay in the first 2 years but couldn't decide on a major, only decided on one to remove the 105 credit rule.

could someone explain to me the difference between a dog person and a cat person? i figured not, this is the wrong subreddit for that.

i dunno maybe i didn't realize back in high school that i hated school. its something i learned in ap psychology called repressed emotion. or maybe its not even that, maybe i didn't know how to take care of myself but my mom knew what foods to feed me.

"consequences of taking a late drop hey dawgs,

i feel really screwed over this quarter by the fact that it’s online. i’m normally a 3.6ish student in my math classes, but this quarter i’ve really slipped on one and i don’t think it’s a great indicator of how i am as a student under normal circumstances. i’m planning on taking the next two quarters off for an internship and to earn some money.

i think i’m going to drop my math class. i’ve never done this before, and unfortunately my advisor is useless so i don’t think i’ll get an answer from him before the deadline.

will taking a w fuck me over with major admissions? i’m banking on the fact that it’s during and caused by the pandemic.

"faq for astr 101, 150, and ess 102 these are some pretty popular classes people take for either nw or i&s credits. i've taken all three so i wanted to provide some helpful information that i've seen people ask now-and-then on this sub.

these questions apply to all three classes (or where otherwise stated):

* are there math/physics pre-reqs?

>no. you need no knowledge or understanding of physics whatsoever for any of the classes. you don't need anything more than knowing arithmetic. **all physics and math necessary to pass the course will be covered in class or in class materials.**

* how much time lecture/study/etc per week?

>for all of these classes, you should expect to forfeit a mere 6-8 hours of your time most weeks.

* asynchronous?

>yes to all, but ess 102 moves a little faster, so i wouldn't postpone the work too much

* lectures necessary?

>100%. these classes are completely covered in the lectures. don't worry thought. that doesn't mean your hands are going to fall off at the end of each lecture. the profs are very clear in what information you should be taking away.

* how good are these online?

>the astronomy department has had astr 101 and 150 online since 2015, so it's super streamlined already. ess 102 doesn't have that same history, but it already seems to have most of the kinks out of the system. either way, all of these courses are super lenient in helping you get the grade you want.

* what is the homework like? (ess 102)

>**weekly labs that take 15-30 minutes.** the labs appear to be really long at first glance because they typically have a lot of questions, but most of the questions are asking you to either regurgitate information from the lectures or are asking for information that proves you did some of the physics activities.  
>  
>note: normally the class would be taken in person and thus would have labs at the university; using tools provided by the university to demonstrate the physics covered in the lectures. i'm taking the class right now and would say they have done a good job at creating labs that require nothing more than your cell phone, a ruler, and access to internet.

* what is the homework like? (astr 101, 150)

>astr 101/150 both have weekly discussion questions (dq), which you basically find a article that relates to a prompt, and then write a few sentences summarizing the article you found. i found astr 101 dq's took on average less time than astr 150. 150 is a lot more technical than 101, so sometimes it took me like an hour or two just to find an article that was long enough to write about. **expect 10 minutes or more on the dq**.  
>  
>on top of that there are ""labs"". astr 101 labs are generally more interactive and involve using some pretty fun programs. in those labs you basically answer questions that proved you messed around with the programs. both astr 101 and 150 also involve questions that involve using equations learned in class and writing short answers that prove you understand how the math/physics works. **expect 10-30 minutes on the labs.**

* do i need to read the textbook? (astr 101, 150)

>no. you do not need to read the textbook to pass, however, i found the textbook especially helpful  for getting more information on topics that weren't quite clear to me.

* is the textbook free? (astr 101, 150)

>astr 101 textbook pdf should be provided on your class canvas page for free. paper copies are also available for purchase (relatively cheap too!). astr 150: iirc textbook wasn't free, but also wasn't necessary either. so...

* how do i get help with the class?

>not exactly an faq, but something i want to make clear to people who haven't taken any astronomy related courses:  
>  
>the professors and tas who are in or associated with the astronomy department are **super** nice and helpful. it's a niche department at the uw, but i think that makes these people some of the most eager to make sure you understand the material.

&#x200b;

**course content:**

* astronomy 101
   * great detail into all of the laws of physics behind gravity and planetary motion; different types of stars and galaxies; and the origins of the universe and star formation
   * also covers good amount of the history of astronomy, but it is not really tested on
   * vague on formation of planets
* astronomy 150
   * very brief and vague on all of the information covered in astr 101. could potentially be confusing for people who have no understanding of the laws of physics, but that being said, you really only need to know how to use the equations. also this material makes up a fraction of the course as a whole.
   * great detail into the formation of our planets; the different types of planets, their chemical makeup, and why they contain said materials; how to identity the age of a planet's surface.
* ess 102
   * the first half of the class is basically a crash course on astr 150. thus the laws of physics and more general concepts which were briefly covered in 150, are covered exponentially faster in ess 102. that being said, you can always get help from the ta's.
   * the second half of the course is geared towards preparing you for the final project. thus the topics shift towards orbital mechanics and planetary research missions.

&#x200b;

**tl;dr**

* astr 101 can be taken by anyone. super easy class that is all about understanding the concepts (as opposed to the math and physics).
* astr 150 can be a little more challenging. since the course is designed for people with no background to be able to take the course, some necessary material covered in astr 101 has to be covered rapidly in order to make time for the prime material of the class. both classes offer the same credit, so i would recommend taking 101 before 150 if you can or have little to no understanding of how the universe work.
* ess 102 involves material from both astr 101 and 150, but mostly 150. since ess 102 has to involve all of that information in addition to orbital mechanics and planetary missions (like probes and robots), the course can feel super fast at times. that being said, just like the astr classes, this course technically provides you with all the information necessary to pass. it just comes down to how well you are able to absorb and understanding the material. if you need nw credits on top of the i&s provided by the class, i would recommend you take astr 150 at a minimum before this class.

"foreign language requirements question i only finished two years of spanish in high school and was planning to take spanish again throughout college. i am for sure not the greatest in spanish where i will place into the fourth quarter and not have to take the course, but i am a bit confused on how the courses work.

if i were to be placed into a second quarter spanish through my placement test would that mean i only have to take two more courses (second and third year spanish)? 

is a third-quarter course just like spanish 103? or do i have to take three quarters (101, 102, and 103) worth of spanish to count towards my foreign language requirements?

i’m not entirely sure what order i’m supposed to take the courses and how placement exactly works so i can receive the foreign language credit. is it safer for me to start on a brand new foreign language to get my credits over with or wait until i take my placement test and go from there (although i can only read and partially write in spanish)?",advice

the thing is, i'm concerned about the pacing or difficulty of uw japanese courses. for comparison the 102 equiv course at my cc took around a little bit more than 2 weeks for each chapter in genki 1. my counselor said it goes quick, recommending i could take 102 again should i need to. however i emailed kaoru ohta sensei and he said i should just take 103 in spring since i've already completed chapter 8 of genki.

"who do i contact about issues with a professors grading? tldr: i couldn’t answer for a 4th of the questions on my exam and my prof would not help me. who do i talk to?

i had an exam the other day and couldn’t understand a question. even worse the work for said question was needed for other questions and i effectively was unable to answer a forth of my test. i emailed my professor asking for clarification and never got anything back. i emailed again after the test asking if i could have some sort of retest or if i could have those questions ignored from my score and she refused and said she would not say anything else to me until grades were posted. 

i don’t know about everyone else, but any time a test question’s wording was confusing for students that question was either clarified or removed from grading. the one time i was testing at the drs and they couldn’t get ahold of the prof for clarification before the test ended they exempted the question for me. 

i have autism so it can be hard for me to understand or explain something when it comes to words. it’s not the first time i was unable to get clarification for a test question and then it happened that question was not counted for me.

plus several other students posted in piazza with confusion too. 

who do i talk do about this? 

some more details that might matter?:

this is for stat 311. my prof’s reasoning for rejecting my request was that it didn’t look like i understood the concepts for the question in the first place when i originally asked for clarification. from what i understood, the question asked for a description of the sampling distribution, and to find the mean and standard deviation for a histogram that showed the age range of voters vs what percent that age range made of all voters. what confused me was that it asked for the distribution of the 55-64 age voters, not the distribution of all voters, or so i understood it. so i messaged my prof asking if there was supposed to be a scatter plot for this age range because the question asked for a description of the distribution. i then understood it to mean i’m supposed to compare the distribution or in other words percent of voters that were ages 55-64 vs every other age ranger. of course you cant compute a mean or sd for that, but i ran out time, i just wanted to have proof that i was confused on how i was supposed to understand the question, and i needed to put down something. 

i emailed professor again and she said that because i asked her if i was supposed to have a scatter plot, i could have not understood the concept in the first place as this is a question about sampling distribution, which has nothing to do with scatter plots. the reason i asked for a scatter plot was because part of the question asked to describe the distribution which made me thing of that. regardless, as i mentioned in the above paragraph, i then understood the question to ask to compare the percentages of voters age 55-64 vs every other age range which is categorical and would technically give a sampling distribution. however i never mentioned it to her during the exam because she never responded back, what are the odds she would respond this time, and i never mentioned it after because i through it was irrelevant as the bottom line was that i was confused by the question and couldn’t actually answer it. i can’t explain it to her now because the last thing she said to me was that she would not respond anymore until grades were posted.

"warning for new students coming from high school (ap credits) tl;dr: don't apply ap credits to your transcript until you know know you need them to graduate.

edit: there are some insights in the comments that are contrary to what i have in this post, so if anyone is facing this situation, look below for more experiences!

i wanted to make a warning that i really wish i heard from someone before i entered the uw.

once you apply ap credits to your transcript, you cannot take them off.this is an issue because once you reach 225 credits, you are ineligible for financial aid for the credits you take after that.so if you decide to pursue a minor or a double major, which you need to take more credits for, but bring in a bunch of ap credits beforehand, that cap will prevent you from receiving financial aid when you take classes that exceed 225 credits.

my advice is:

* don't apply your ap credits to your transcript until you know:

1. exactly what requirement you are applying them to
2. you will not take a class during your time at uw that would eventually satisfy that requirement anyway

* don't apply ap english(both lang and lit) unless you only need to fill a certain number of credits. they don't fulfill any requirements and are just empty credits.

i have no idea how running start works, so i can't say anything about that.

i'm double majoring and won't be eligible for financial aid during my senior year because of the cap.when i made an inquiry about removing ap credits that i don't need that would put me under the cap until i graduate, the admissions office told me i couldn't.

if anyone has advice for me, that would be much appreciated, but i had no idea this could be an issue when i entered the uw. i was always under the impression from everyone around me that more ap credits were always better. this is not always true, so be wise before sending your scores in.

"questions comparing uw vs wwu from prospective student hi everybody. i'm getting out of the army and am looking at heading to school for environmental science. i've got wwu and uw (all 3 campuses) in mind and i'd like some insight from the attendees about the differences between the two as a whole campus, pros and cons, and key insights into details of the environmental science program.

specific questions:

-let me hear your insights on comparing the two.

-what does the job outlook like for environmental science after graduating wwu vs. uw

-part time opportunities. how accessible are they between the two universities both on and off campus?

-i'll be living off campus and commuting in. any significant considerations for either uni/campus on housing or commuting?

-veterans/va support. a bit specific to my situation, but what kind of veterans support stuff is on campus?

-the city. i'm from portland or but have lived in upstate ny for the last few years, what's the general vibe of bellingham vs seattle/tacoma/bothell?

-class size. i know western is far smaller than uw. how does it affect you at your school? is it an issue or a boon?

-extracurriculars. mature students. i'll be a 23 year old off campus freshman. any insight into that experience.
-kind of tied in with the above - internships, research opportunities. i've read into hiring demographics for my desired major and it's essentially decided by your fieldwork/internships. what sort of opportunities have you guys had access to at your various campuses?

-any further advice on anything surroundimg the above, sage life advice, college advice, picking class. its all welcome and i'm all ears.

full disclosure, this is a blanket post between the wwu subreddit and the uw subreddit so i can get a range of takes. i hope that's not an issue.

"story of my fall quarter. this quarter started off so well (i thought): interesting classes, reopened restaurants and gyms, and relatively returned social life around campus.

however, looking at myself now, i'm agonized over failed exams, messy living space, fucked up schedule, non-existent social life, receding leanness, and little motivation. i have a few friends whom i used to rely on so much for social life who left the state of washington and won't be back for a while. ima used to be my coping method against stress and anxiety and that's not of any possibility for me. i hate living alone, so i would go out and wander around but even the most ordinary activities like 'having a sip of coffee sitting down' have been taken away from me after nov 17th. where is the laughter in the hub, where is the studiousness in suzallo, where is the constant chatter in kane, where are the smiley faces at the quad. i'm not seeing them and it's breaking my heart.

i know that people say hardship in life teaches one to be stronger and more resilient but i'm inundated by so much inopportune experience all at the same time and i don't have time to recover myself from one to move on to another. to be candid this has arguably been the worst time so far of my 20 years of life. i'm easily irritable, anxious af, depressed, unstable, confrontational, agonized, hopeless, and friendless. my soul is teared apart, i'm a walking cadaver.

i tried to get therapy but since everything is online, i'm not feeling its healing power as it should have given to its recipients if done offline.

i hope everyone of you who's reading this realizes having the company of friends, roomates, family, or even significant others during such harsh times is a luxurious privilege to people like me, and being able to just finish school work while still having a basic schedule is also a respectable achievement that you should be proud of yourself. acknowledge yourself and people around you, be grateful of how life is still moving on although it might seem frivolous for me to say.  at last, smile and be happy for people like me who are unable to do so.

i'm in disbelief, i don't think (alot) of people do that. & even if people did look up solutions - whatever, that's thier choice. that doesn't effect my learning, do what you gotta do. its just that if that is true, the mean and median grades are skewed and do not represent the classes true understanding of the material. and maybe more ppl are  struggling like me??

i'm in my third year, majoring in physics and music, and last quarter i failed two of my classes for the first time in my life. i completely lost my motivation for school after my daily routine being identical for 9 months straight: all day is spent in front of the computer. my desk is my classroom, where i relax, where i hang out with friends, and where i do homework.

this was after i auditioned to major in music in september and didn't get accepted on the instrument of my preference.

this quarter started off promising, i was hoping to find my motivation for academics again, but after a few weeks of missing and assignment here and there and occasionally missing a lecture because it feels pointless to get out of bed, i've found myself failing 2 classes again. i even took only 12 credits this quarter and it's still too much to handle. i only have enough in me for one class. i've tried again and again to put as much effort into all my classes online as i did when they were in person and i've come the conclusion that after this long i just can't. if they didn't introduce the s/ns option for quarters taken during the global pandemic i would have probably dropped out by now.

"new spring 2021 music law course  

interested in music? interested in law? consider taking law p 536, music law & policy, in spring quarter 2021. this innovative, interdisciplinary 3-credit course, which meets synchronously on zoom on mondays and wednesdays from 1:30pm-2:50pm, will focus primarily on u.s. copyright law as it relates to musical compositions and sound recordings, with some attention paid to the ways in which trademark law and the right of personality are relevant to music and musicians. before delving into the nuances of intellectual property law as it relates to music, the course will provide students with an overview of what, exactly, it means to *be* music, with students receiving a crash course in the basics of music theory sufficient to understand musical terminology as it arises in legal disputes. students will then learn about existing music law precedents and current legal controversies not only by reading doctrine and case law, but also by examining the musical scores and listening to the musical sound recordings at issue in those cases. no prior knowledge of music theory or intellectual property law is required as the course will teach both of those subjects from the ground up.

non-law students interested in taking the course can contact the professor directly at pnicolas \[at uw dot edu\] for questions about the course or for assistance in obtaining an add code. although law students are the primary audience, it is open to students in any department. sln for non-law students is 21506.",academics

"questions on drinking/partying/social life/housing from an exchange student from the uk obvious covid disclaimer, any questions related to partying assume it'll be safe to do so next year.

i will (most likely) be studying as a junior at uw next year as an exchange student from the uk, and my only knowledge of drinking/partying/social life at us colleges comes from tv and movies so i've got like a dozen questions. male, will be 20 for most of the school year.

given the drinking age of 18, ""partying"" at uni in the uk involves just buying alcohol and drinking in halls, or going to university bars, or going to clubs/bars in the city (i live in london) like any adult. pretty standard at my uni at least would be clubbing or going to student bar 2-4 times a week. how does uw compare?

the consensus from previous posts seems to be that if you're not ""in the greek system"", as a guy you're not going to get into any frat parties. is this still/actually the case? also, what does ""in"" mean? do you have to actually be in a frat, or if you are friends with fraternity member(s) will you be able to reliably get onto guestlists? or is having friends get you on guestlists more of a sometimes works/sometimes doesn't thing?

if to reliably (like every week or fortnight) get into frat parties you actually have to be in a frat, is this an option for an exchange student? 

what are the non-frat options like? do people under 21 generally have fake ids and go to clubs/bars in the city? how common are non-frat house parties, and how is it to get into them? is it just a case of knowing people?

do most juniors/seniors live off-campus? i don't really want to have to try to organise private accom abroad, so assume i'll apply for halls/apartments, so would i live predominantly with people younger than me?

are any halls more/less social than others? (the reputation seems to change year by year from previous posts). what are apartments like, as in do they have staff, or can you just drink as if it were private accom?

"thoughts on phys12x i've been hearing a lot about how awful the phys12x series has been in the last couple quarters, so if anyone is interested, here are some study tips for physics from an upperclassman.

note: i took phys121 and 122 in person, and 123 online. this advice applies to both cases, but focuses on characteristics of the class itself and not on the zoom experience.

&#x200b;

**stuff about the physics series that you probably know already (but if not, you really should):**

the intro physics series are some of the hardest classes to take while you're getting used to a college-level study routine...as you’ve probably noticed. it might help to hear that it's not just made that way to torture you and make the averages low. the material goes so fast because it's basically throwing an entire four years' worth of undergraduate physics at you in a condensed format. i think the idea is that you get exposure to all the topics, so when they reappear in your later classes, you're a little more familiar with them, even though they'll be reworked at a slower and clearer pace as you go more in-depth. is this a good policy? probably not, but that's how it is. sadly, we don't run the physics department and we have to work with what they give us.

all three classes in the series are tough, but it’s generally said that 121 is medium, 122 is hardest, and 123 is easiest. a lot of us find phys122 challenging mainly because a.) things don't make visual, intuitive sense like they do in mechanics, and b.) the transition from electricity to magnetism can catch you off guard. if you don't have a good grasp on electricity by the time you start magnetism, that's when things get really confusing. phys123 is probably the easiest just because it's a grab-bag of different topics, instead of units that build on each other. so, if you're lost on one topic, it's less of a catastrophic cascade event and more of an ""i can review this later"" situation.

it is (unfortunately) possible to spend hours and hours ""working on physics"" and not making any actual progress. (speaking from experience here.) you do need to build some good study habits and focus on understanding concepts before you do homework problems. bashing your head against a wall isn't going to earn you anything but a headache. it doesn't mean you're stupid or that you're bad at physics, just that you’re misdirecting your efforts, which is something you can improve on as you get experience.

&#x200b;

**homework:**

imo, mastering physics is the worst out of the evil trinity that is mastering, aleks, and webassign. that little progress bar in aleks might be demoralizing as hell, but mastering is the most likely to give you a homework problem in three parts with concepts building on each other and no way to check where you got the math wrong.

the advice that worked for me is this: never feel bad if the homework doesn't make sense immediately, and (seriously) don't try to brute force your way through a problem if you're stuck. if you haven't made progress for more than 15min, it's time to set that homework aside and hunt for a similar practice problem in the textbook, rewatch the lecture, or take the problem to clue/study center/office hours. you might be surprised at how much more efficient this is.

&#x200b;

**exams:**

you know that handy equation sheet pdf everyone gets? don't just use it on the exam - print it out asap and use it when you do the homework. making the equation sheet your friend is one of the easiest ways to speed up your problem-solving. get familiar with where the equations are located on the sheet, annotate it if you need to, and you'll be much less likely to overlook the equation you needed or plug it in incorrectly on a midterm or final.

an annoying decision from the physics department is that you only receive two practice tests per exam, but clue gives out more, and lots of students might have extras that were available from past years because of friends/siblings who took the class previously. it's a stupid system - you shouldn't need to network just to get access to study materials. maybe you all can push the department to end that policy. boycott them or something, i don't know.

&#x200b;

**office hours:**

go to office hours. that is all. if you already understand why this is important, you don't need to keep reading. if you need convincing, here are some thoughts:

* if you're confused about a thing, you may as well ask the person who has a phd in that thing to explain it to you. (i remember being in e-fig and being told that it's better to go to clue/study centers before bothering your professors. that is a fat lie. get the information from the source.)
* even if your professor's lecture style doesn't really make sense to you, you can still learn a lot from office hours because you're able to ask questions or hear other students ask questions. if you really don't like your professor, at least try going to office hours with another one - there are usually multiple professors teaching each intro class.
* a lot of professors will actually work through problems step-by-step if you ask them to. hint hint: this is good for those tough mastering physics problems.
* if nothing else, go to office hours on the week of the exam. your professor is likely to give you hints on what will be covered.
* networking!!! it is completely possible to take a huge weedout class like phys12x and have your professor remember your name, one year and several hundred students later, when she's worried about the midterm averages in her current classes and thinks advice from a student might do some good. (busted; yes, i was asked to write this. see? your professors do care.) why does she remember me? she wrote me a recommendation letter that helped me land a summer research gig. why did she do that? you guessed it; i went to office hours.

&#x200b;

i think i'm done ranting, but while we're at it, here are three online resources that may help you out if you don't use them already:

1. **course evaluation catalogue:** it's like rate my professor, but less salt. may give you a better sense of the average student's experience. [https://www.washington.edu/assessment/course-evaluations/cec/](https://www.washington.edu/assessment/course-evaluations/cec/)
2. **dubhub**: see the average grade distributions per class, per professor. [https://www.dubhub.pub/](https://www.dubhub.pub/)
3. **libgen:** free textbooks. use it. it will save you money. not in phys12x, because pearson is viciously protective of its copyrights, but definitely in other classes. [https://libgen.is/](https://libgen.is/)

i could potentially stay with my family in bainbridge and commute via ferry/bus and/or bike every day, but i'm not sure how realistic that is or if there's a safe way to store a bicycle on campus. my family and i may also kill each other by the end of the year if we spend much more time together (quarantine has all driven us insane i think, but maybe leaving every day for school would give us more space from each other).

"hcde: graduate school? hi everyone,

i wanted to post this question because i feel that i get many mixed responses regarding graduate school for people going into the ux field. as an undergrad in the hcde program, i was considering applying for the department's masters program, but i'm worried about the prospect of paying off student loans that i feel will accumulate too much over time (note: im a oos student). 

a lot of people i've talked to say that graduate school is unnecessary, particularly in the ux field, and developing a strong portfolio is much preferred. however, my question is that wouldn't going to graduate school strengthen your overall portfolio and resume? additionally, when searching for careers, it seems many of the positions seek for people with more work experience and preferably a degree higher than that of a bs. i feel that i would stand no chance compared to much more experienced candidates with refined portfolios when it comes to the competition for jobs. 

it also seems that much of the ""prestige"" of the hcde dept. lies in their master's programs as i can't seem to find too much information regarding the bachelor's program. maybe i'm wrong. but, i just feel really lost about this subject because i've really yet to figure out my career track, let alone figure out if graduate school is something i should consider. i'm panicking because i'm going to be a junior soon, and i have no idea what i want to do with my degree or have even started a solid portfolio. 

for hcde people, how difficult was it to find a job, particularly with a bs degree? is graduate school worth the financial investment? for those going into hcde ms program, why did you choose to do so? what differences are there in bs and ms programs for hcde? do you have any advice on how to get started on your portfolio early?

if you're a freshman or sophomore (or honestly anyone this applies to) at uw, and you're not doing as well as you thought you would because you were a straight-a student in hs, but for some reason, you can't seem to perform as well at uw, this post is for you.

i am currently a junior majoring in engineering, and these are my grades for this quarter. it might be hard to believe, but my gpa for my first quarter at uw as a freshman was a whopping 2.23, with two out of the three classes with a gpa of below 2.0, i felt stupid, incompetent, and embarrassed. i thought that since hs was a breeze for me, college would be the same. i never needed any type of help in hs, so reaching out for help was never something i was comfortable with, along with my flawed studying habits i was also working 25-30 hours a week. this continued for a couple more quarters with me cutting down my work hours to 13 hours a week, while i was trying to figure out how to succeed at uw, until i eventually ended up being on academic probation, and at risk of losing my dtc engr status. i thought it was over, and maybe i should just drop out. but i didn't. i decided to quit my job and work my ass off devoting all of my time to studying, as well as reaching out for help whenever i needed help. my grades started to slowly go up, and eventually, here we are.

the moral of the story is to reach out for help, don't be embarrassed, reach out to your professors, tas, advisors, classmates, and tutors, they are there to help you succeed. adjust your studying habits to help you succeed in your courses, stop prioritizing things that aren't important (for me, it was my part-time job at a grocery store).

don't give up, you've got this, i believe in you!

"university gpa before military service and applying afterwards first, i apologize for bringing up what has likely been plastered all over this sub with varying personal context.

&#x200b;

for background, after high school graduation, i applied and was accepted to the university of arizona. through a complete and utter lack of motivation and self discipline, i preformed extremely poorly, ultimately withdrawing after 2 years. i joined the navy almost immediately afterwards to take some of the burden off of my parents, who were supporting me entirely financially, as well as my younger brothers who were just starting college themselves.

&#x200b;

my military service gave me plenty of time to figure out what i was doing with myself and how i could fix what went wrong before. as banal as it sounds, i believe i've been able to build a foundation of self respect and work ethic that i didn't have before i enlisted and i want to prove that to myself by going back to and finishing a degree.

&#x200b;

because of my previous performance at the ua and the impression of me that my transcript would undoubtedly give, i'm admittedly very nervous of the fact that my application could be rejected due to my shortcomings in the past. my plan is to go to a wa cc for 2 years before applying as a transfer student to the uw with the intention of maintaining a competitive gpa there.

&#x200b;

i know that a lot of this post probably seems ""poor me""ish and desperate but i really am a bit scared and i wanted to give some info of where i'm coming from with my question. with the end of my 5 year active duty contract coming up in less than 2 weeks, i want to be sure i'm making a decent decision to do all of this.

&#x200b;

have any of you had a similar experience with doing poorly either in high school or otherwise and successfully applying? what are the chances that my previous grades would keep me from being accepted regardless of how well i do at cc? are there any specific steps i should take beyond putting my full effort into my gpa to improve my chances?

"in need of housing 2021-2022 help so me and my friend are planning on moving in to the dorms in the fall of this year, but we have some questions. we’ll be sophomores in the fall & we’ve never lived on campus. 

we have a few questions regarding housing as applications are coming up:

1) is it better to have two or three roommates? pricing wise, it’s definitely cheaper to have 3, but is it a good idea? especially since we don’t know anyone as of now who is looking for a 3 person dorm, we’d likely have to find someone who we don’t know to move in with us. should we stick to us 2 living together and pay extra, or find a 3rd roommate to pay less?

2) are any halls better than others, and would you suggest north or west campus? pricing looks to be the same for all halls, and the “amenities” are all that’s different (such as a gym vs a grocery store). we’re wanting a private bathroom for sanitary reasons so with that in mind, which hall would be the best, if any?
    - or should we get an apartment? money is a pretty     big focus of ours, we’re trying to save as much money as possible.
• also, if we were to do the apartment, how would this work if we went home for summer?

3) is there a dining plan level requirement? is there a minimum level we have to buy based on the hall we chose + the price of the hall?",advice

"japan 203, japan 234, or japan 301? i previously took 2 quarters out of a 3 quarter 2nd-year japanese sequence at a community college back in 2017-2018, though i never got around to taking the 3rd quarter due to schedule conflicts. i took a placement interview last summer after transferring in and was told that i could either place into japan 203 or japan 301.

i'd originally planned on just taking japan 203 this quarter, but i later changed my mind. however, when i asked again recently, the instructor raised concerns about starting directly from japan 301 due to the length of time since i'd last taken japanese classes, saying that it would probably be too difficult.

i know my screw-up probably could've been avoided if i'd simply asked earlier. could anyone give any advice on what i should do from here on out?

i could take the 2nd-year intensive over the coming summer, but i transferred into uw with a lot of credits, so i'm worried that doing so would push me to the credit ceiling much sooner. alternatively, i could just take japan 203 next spring.

would it be worth trying to convince the instructor to let me take japan 301, or is this a bad idea? while i haven't been actively studying during the gap, i've still managed to retain most of my vocabulary, listening comprehension, and reading/writing due to a combination of using anki fairly intensively back in the day and semi-regular usage. if i go down this route, i would be devoting a lot of time this quarter and over the summer to reviewing.",advice

▪︎i'm social to some extent but i really don't want it to interfere with my studies. basically i prefer some place where i can focus on studies, academic clubs and stuff.

▪︎also i'm coming as a cs major... would be great if housing was close to my classes

▪︎i don't mind if housing is 2 person, 3 person or whatever. i don't prefer single housing.

▪︎communal or private bathroom, anything is fine as long as it ain't nasty lol.

▪︎as of now, i'm not considering cost as a factor. i hope to work on campus to try to cover up the cost a little.

hope you guys can help me :)))",student life

"hansee 3 person suite vs mcmahon double room + general north campus advice hello! 
incoming freshman here. 
i'm considering north campus dorms...

out of the 6 dorms, 4 are extremely similar in pricing and dorm layout... and i'm not too sure about these 4 cuz a 4 person or 3 person suite i feel is pretty small and not worth it??? the doubles and singles here are just outta my reach :(

*i'm not striking of these 4 options, still considering them*

so the remaining two are hansee and mcmahon.

♤ in hansee, i'm considering a 3 person suite which is 6k per year. i just want to know your opinions. 

i've heard hansee is very quiet and everyone is not that social??? but a 3 person suite will be more social i think?
do many freshmen live in hansee?

also it has a bicycle storage room (unlike mcmahon) inside which is a big plus for me. i plan to get a cycle to go to class as well as for recreation.

♤ in mcmahon, i'm looking at the double room which is 7k per year.

i've heard mcmahon is very social due to the cluster system. do many freshmen live in mcmahon?

there is no cycle storage... we have to keep it outside the bldg on the rails... very likely to be stolen.

☆☆☆ the thing is i like quiet environments to some extent, where i can focus on academics... not extremely noisy and stuff.
hansee and mcmahon seem to be on two extreme ends. i believe some sociability is important which a 3 or 4 person suite in hansee will facilitate???☆☆☆

i'm sorry for the long post but it would be very helpful if you can drop me your opinions. 

should i choose hansee, mcmahon or any of the remaining four dorms?",student life

"list of a potential violation by asuw's bod president camille hattwig to start with, i am an incoming graduate student from out-of-state with no involvement in asuw, however, i do have multiple years of experience serving in my undergraduate university's student governments. after reading the recent situation with asuw and the daily, i believe camille hattwig and any other officers involved in the sending of the mass email, should face some consequences for their targeted harassment and bully behavior. i have compiled a basic list of *potential* violations. the elections rules seem to be applicable if is she is affiliated with or advocates for any of the candidates, but i included them in case y'all know more about her campaign involvement. i make no guarantees that any of these necessarily apply, but i do believe publishing a list is necessary for anybody wanting to make a complaint. here's a list of potential violations:

&#x200b;

from the [asuw constitution](http://records.asuw.org/getdecision.php?id=5):

article 8 § 4a: ""the student senate has the power to consider and approve resolutions of student opinion, which stand as the official opinion of the asuw in the manner prescribed by this section. **no other body of the asuw may formulate official\* asuw student opinion.**"" \*see below

&#x200b;

from the [asuw bylaws](http://records.asuw.org/getdecision.php?id=6):

article 1 § 2g: ""\[the president shall\] serve as the **official** spokesperson of the asuw in campus, community, and inter-school relationships;""

article 1 § 2t: ""\[the president shall\] handle major public relations efforts with national and local press **in coordination with the communications director**;"" did she coordinate with the communications director first?

&#x200b;

from the [asuw communications policy](http://comm.asuw.org/files/2018/10/current-asuw-communications-policy-edited-spring-2018.pdf):

section 4 § 1e: ""asuw employees remain expected to use their assigned asuw email accounts to communicate with individuals and entities external to the asuw."" instead of using her personal email to share her individual opinion, her use of the main asuw email account for the accusations suggests it was an official communication.

section 5 § 3.b.ii: ""**no negative language about any group, person, or entity shall ever be posted by any entity or initiative pages associated with the asuw**.""

&#x200b;

from the [2021 elections policies and procedures](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/):

section 5 § 6: ""no asuw employee, volunteer, appointee, entity, or committee may make endorsements in their official capacity such as using their title or position; and no asuw equipment or supplies, including employment time or office hours, phones, office machines, office space, and email accounts, may be used for campaign purposes, except as authorized by the eac. any candidate or ballot measure advocate receiving an endorsement from an asuw employee, volunteer, or appointee in personal capacity must, when campaigning with such endorsement, clearly state that such endorsement is in the individual’s personal capacity only.""

section 6 § 2.2: ""\[campaigning includes\] addressing crowds to promote or oppose a ballot measure or candidate.""

section 6 § 2.5: ""\[campaigning includes\] use of electronic or social media to publicly promote or oppose a ballot measure or candidate.""

section 6 (weird formatting): ""candidates, affiliates, and ballot measure advocates may not campaign while acting in an official capacity of the asuw.""

section 6 § 3.7: ""\[no candidate, candidate’s affiliate, ballot measure advocate, or ballot measure advocate’s affiliate may, in the course of campaigning\] **use electronic media to interfere with the neutrality of the ballot**...""

section 6 § 3.10: ""**violating any applicable law, whether federal, state, or local is a severe violation.**"" depending on how liberally you interpret her email and the laws, one *could* argue it was a libel against the daily as an organization.

section 7 § 8.7: ""\[no candidate, candidate’s affiliate, ballot measure advocate, or ballot measure advocates affiliate may\] **use any force, threat or unlawful means to hinder or deter any voter from voting, or to obtain a vote for or against any candidate or ballot measure**.""

section 9 § 6: ""**liability exists for even unintentional or unknowing violations**, unless intent or knowledge is an essential element of the provision violated.""

section 10 § 4.2: ""**\[complaints may allege a violation by\] an entity of the asuw**.""

&#x200b;

to conclude, this is not a personal vendetta against camille. i do think, as someone who cares about student body representation and making serious, progressive change, her actions as an asuw official should warrant repercussions as outlined by asuw's governing documents. if you are making a complaint, please follow the procedures laid out in [section 11](http://vote.asuw.org/rules/). **please do not harass or violate the privacy of anyone!**",student life

my parents are encouraging me to apply for the graduate student housing on campus, and i'm not sure how to feel about it.  i lived on campus for all 4 years of undergrad, so even though the grad student housing are apartments, i still feel like i'm trying to put off being an adult by living on campus *again*.  additionally, (and this sounds really stupid) i wouldn't be able to have a pet, and that makes me sad.  literally one of the things that got me through being away from home during undergrad was looking at pictures of my cat and reminding myself that i'm seeing her again in x amount of weeks.  especially since i'm moving cross-country, i feel like having a cat to cuddle or something when (if?) i get homesick will really help me mentally.

i'm legally disabled, so i *technically* qualify for an emotional support animal (esa).  the worst part of my disability is the mental toll that can come with it, so an esa would help some in that regard.  however, looking at the uw housing website, it seems i have to not only have a current relationship with an animal in order to register it as an esa (so, i couldn't adopt a pet and *then* register it as an esa), but when i apply, i have to be ready to submit documentation for disability requests.  i *could* register my cat as an esa, but she's almost 12 years old and i literally do not think she would survive a move from atlanta to seattle. so, based on all this, i don't think i'd be able to live on campus and have a pet (if i'm wrong and someone else knows more about the esa process, please correct me!).

current uw students (graduate *or* undergrad), what do y'all think?  i'm still trying to weigh being happy but cash-strapped vs being more financially secure but longing for things i couldn't have if i lived on campus.",advice
"anyone here like making music? i'll be straight with you: i haven't been able to develop much of a social life at this school. covid struck  right as i was starting to climb out of my shell, and meeting with rsos through zoom just hasn't been working for me.

anywho, i'm now living around north campus, and i spend most of my time writing and producing music (i play guitar, drums, and make digital music), and aggressively studying japanese, which i'm also super passionate about.

if any of that sounds cool to you, please don't hesitate to hit me up. i am eager to collaborate or even just chill and get high or play minecraft or call of duty or something. just looking to make the rest of this quarter a little less solitary.

"why is gh 101 so hard? dont take?! quick rant/advice for people who are going to take this class. i find gh 101 to be extremely difficult and as someone who has taken weed-out courses at the uw, i don't understand why the staff is being so unhelpful. we have weekly quizzes worth 10% of our grade but they're just fine. for some reason my ta finds a reason to take a couple points off each assignment for a little reason like spacing, formatting, or something related to not answering the whole question even though there's only 150 words and i mentioned all of the different factors like structural adjustment programs. i don't know why they're treating a 100 level class like a 400 level one, and believe me i've taken 400 level global/public health classes. the weekly assignment are super time consuming and it would be nice of them to make them more creative to do. or clarify their high expectations. 

also, i just looked it up, but the professor has like 1.9/5 reviews on rate my professor which makes sense considering how i see more of my tas than the the professor, and all of the lectures are online lectures with a speaker talking over the slides which are photos. besides tuesdays lectures, you never even see the professors or get feedback/advice/help from them which i understand! they are just active on the discussion board. and yes they seem like nice people just not good professors. also, i don't think they create a very inclusive environment for poc but that's another thing. racism in the healthcare field is also an important topic to discuss. if i'm sounding negative i apologize, it's just that i expected more from the class and i'm putting in a lot of work in the readings taking notes and the lectures. i've also attended office hours but my ta doesn't give me advice on how to improve or what their looking for. i enjoyed global health before taking this class, and unless they change the structure, i wouldn't recommend it for incoming freshman or anyone interested in global health majors or minors.",academics

"amath 35x or math 20x series hi all,

i'm currently a freshman engrud hoping for meche placement in the fall. since meche requires amath 301, i figured i should consider doing the optional replacement for math 20x with the amath 35x series which would guarantee me the amath minor with no extra work (assuming i'm placed into meche). i have some questions about the difference between the two different tracks, though. i was wondering what is the difficulty difference between amath and math for these series, as well as if amath 351 requires knowledge of python/matlab yet. i was planning to take amath 351 this summer since almost any engineering placement i'm interested in allows for it to fill a grad requirement, and then taking amath 301 in the fall since it isn't a guarantee i'll need that course if i don't get into meche. does amath 351 rely on python/matlab knowledge, or is it fairly similar to math 207 (307)? thanks in advance!",academics

* how to implement either/or logic in the graph. this is a big one, and will probably take a while.

* positioning when adding new courses or using undo/redo is still buggy.

* no tests, so there are definitely more bugs out there that i haven't found yet.

"what exactly is ""gender-inclusive housing""? i understand generally what the gender inclusive housing option entails, but i'm a little confused about the details.

in my case, i'm a cis-gender woman and i wouldn't want to live with someone of the opposite sex, but i wouldn't mind living with someone who is non-binary, gender fluid, or a transwoman. basically, i don't have any preference between living with another cisgender woman or living with someone who isn't cis, as long as they don't identify as male.

i only see a ""yes/no"" option for this, no ""no preference"" option. does choosing yes mean that i'm  saying i only want to live with someone else who chose this option or just that i'm open to the idea? does choosing no mean that i'm saying i wouldn't want to room with a transwoman or non-binary person? does choosing yes mean that i'm saying i would be fine with living with someone who identifies as male (cis or otherwise)?

i wouldn't want to create an uncomfortable situation for me or anyone else by not fully understanding what this entails before checking yes.

"random advice for freshmen here is a random jumble of advice and info i wish i knew/thought of before coming to uw (much of this is dorm related)

 

* 8 am in high school is very different from 8 am in college. unless you are absolutely sure that you are a morning person--like the type of person who wakes up at 6 a.m.--do not take classes before 10 a.m.! 
* get the lowest level dining account. if you find you need more money you can always level your account up, but if you start with an expensive dining account and you don't spend the money, you're screwed.
* you might not like your roommates. it's fine. even if you talk to them for months before, sometimes it just doesn't work out and that's okay. it happens to a lot of people.
* closet measurements: that rack for hanging your clothes is 32 inches. (hope this helps y'all not overpack)
* worried about storage space? grab yourself one of these bad boys at a very reasonable price from target: https://www.target.com/p/11-8-cube-organizer-shelf-room-essentials-153/-/a-51256587?preselect=15113339#lnk=sametab 
* don't know who needs to hear this, but you do not need to bring that many pairs of shoes. 
* bring several towels. ideally thinner ones so they dry properly.
* clothes you *need*:  a good rain jacket. ideally two. two pairs of rain shoes, either waterproof or water-resistant. that's right, you will thank me for this.
* don't bring tide pods. the washers don't get hot enough for them to melt. 
* bringing posters? scotch mounting putty works great for hanging them on dorm walls! tape… not so much. 
* get a minifridge, get a good one! you do not really need a microwave, every dorm floor has two microwaves so you're not going to have to walk super forward to access a fancy and high-quality microwave. 
* you will in fact need a power cord--the outlets are few and far spread so if you plan on having a lamp, your computer, a clock, and phone plugged in at your desk, you will need this. 
* buy one of those eye masks for sleeping and practice sleeping in it. well look stupid and it's not the most comfortable at first, you and your roommate will thank me when it's 2 a.m. and you want to sleep, and they need to have the lights on so they can stay awake and cram study for a test.  no matter the brightness or what time of day it is, you put that sucker on, and it's pitch black and perfect for sleeping.
* there is no ac in the dorms. you have a heater in your room but the highest i can go is 74 degrees. it autoshuts on at 55 degrees. thus far it has not gotten hot enough that i would want ac but just a heads up it isn't an option.
* bring lights. lamps, string lights, anything. the dorm lighting sucks and the rooms are so gloomy, dark, and depressing. 
* there will be very little daylight during the winter months. some days, if you sleep in late and wake up at 3 p.m, you open your blinds to find it is already dark outside. during these months make sure you get up and experience a few hours of sunlight a day or you will get seasonal depression. it's very real, and it sucks. 
* aleks is evil. learn to fear and hate the name, chances are you'll understand later. 
* sometimes there are homeless people wandering around west campus. most of them are chill, some of them are weird. sometimes the front of the dorm buildings smells like human urine.
* the dining hall food sucks. buy yourself a pan, pot, spatula, knife, mixing bowl, and cutting board from target or ikea or somewhere in case you ever cook. that's honestly about all you need....
* bring a vacuum. and a duster. the dorm's floors get so dirty so fast, and the room gets so damn dusty from the vents. 
* do not overload your schedule! college classes are a lot more self-taught than high school. balance is important, for everyone hard class you're taking, balance it with a passion class or a fun class your first quarter to allow yourself breathing room to adjust. pair your chem class with a film appreciation class or psychology of human sexuality, and your bio class with ceramics or creative writing. you get the idea.
* do not hook up with someone on your dorm hall floor, rookie mistake and it is awkward for the whole year. i did not do it but i know too many people who did eek
* spreadsheet, spreadsheet, spreadsheet! canvas and it's annoying to use in my opinion, the only way i kept from forgetting assignments as i spent hours the first day of school making a spreadsheet ordering all the assignments, tests, quizzes, and projects to speak to a spreadsheet organized by date. then throughout the quarter i just stayed ahead and crossed stuff off the list.",advice

background: i did well and really enjoyed in ap chem in hs (got credit for 142 and 152, but have to retake sequence for med school) did honors physics and 1 quarter of ap physics mechanics (which i didn’t like but was ok at). i am finishing intro bio series this quarter. i want to be able to take the mcat at the end of junior year, so i should be done with gen chem, physics, o chem, and bio chem by end of junior year. 

what i “should” do: take accelerated chem (143/153) this year &amp; and physics 114 sequence. next year take o chem and bio chem. this is think workload-wise makes the most sense, right?

what i want to do: take honors chem (1x5 sequence) this year, o chem and bio chem junior year, and maybe phys 114 sequence next year? or this year?

i was looking into honors chem and honestly it really speaks to me content-wise - i got really excited. i’m not worried so much about the difficulty, rather the work load. if i did honors, when should i take physics? and should i just not do honors and do the more reasonable accelerated sequence?

sorry this is really long if you read this thank you you’re awesome. 

also to any other pre-med kids out there, if you take med school pre-reqs you will be only 1-2 chem courses away from a chem minor (depending on if you take reg vs accelerated/honors chem sequence)

2) rc students need to take 1 year of ""transition"" to achieve 105 credits and 5 quarters before being able to declare a major. i think this factors the required cadrs not completed in high school. is this normal for all uw freshman to need 105 credits before declaring a major? am i literally paying a year's worth of college for high school credits??  


3) i read that if you're not a direct admit, then there is no point going to the computer science route. as a rc student, i can't be counted as a direct admit because i can't even declare a major until after 1-2 years. how will being a rc student affect my chances?  


i am super confused and disillusioned at the prospect of this since rc never really described all the cons of the program. maybe i'm just being dumb but if everything i said above is true, then i don't understand the point of rc. i know that uw is a really good computer science school, but i don't see the advantages of rc over running start, or just finishing 2 years and applying to mit or stanford. any help is appreciated! i feel so lost.",advice

"advice for grad student housing hey everyone, 

i’m a grad/mpacc student starting this fall. i’ve been looking at apartments and applied for a complex in north seattle (bitter lake area ¿?). i was accepted and have the lease agreement, but haven’t signed yet.

i’ve been looking into it a lot more and i’m questioning whether or not i should sign the lease because 1) i’ve been reading questionable things about the area, 2) the rent is ~1,600 w/o utilities and 3) it’s a bit of a drive to uw, i think around 20 mins with traffic.

the apartment itself is pretty nice, a 1br with a balcony and such, i’m just worried whether or not it’s worth the drive and i really don’t know anything about the area, or if i can find something cheaper/closer to uw.

just want you to know you’re the best ta i have ever had. you’re kind, patient, always available, knowledgeable, prepared, professional, fun, and helpful. you care so much about your students’ learning and success. your passion in chemistry helped me grow my passion for chemistry. 

your powerpoint slides are more than amazing. they’re really artistic and informational. the examples you gave in class to connect chemistry to real world problems and industry made the class enjoyable. i can’t imagine how much time and effort you put into those slides.

you always replied email so quickly and with detailed explanation. there was one time i emailed you at 1 pm asking a question about the lab, you not only replied immediately and answered my question but also said ‘go to sleep, don’t stay up late’. it just shows how friendly and caring you are as a ta.

for our final project, you had made such an effective learning environment. i just can’t imagine how you would meet one-on-one with more than 20 students every week to chat about our progress. my friends in other sections said they were put into groups of 5-6 to talk about their project. you also made the project so enjoyable by creating a kahoot game instead of making us presenting.

on top of all the above, you did all of those with your passion for teaching and cares for your students. i know you’re a first year grad student, who is busy with taking classes, doing research, and life. 

i wish everyone could have you as a ta.

"i'm genuinely not okay hi dubfam. i hope summer's been going well for you guys.

this post is going to be all over the place because i don't even know where to start in terms of remedying my situation (i think it's hopeless to be honest, but i've got to get this all off my chest) so i'm very sorry in advance.

the 2020-2021 year was my freshman year at uw. since i had come in from a highly competitive public school in california with a history of nearly all a's, i did not think that this year would turn out the way that it did. though it's no excuse, i would say that my experience with having to adapt to college life in the context of a life-changing pandemic had significant repercussions on my mental health, and so my academics have been beyond poor in my opinion for the entirety of the year.

autumn quarter ended with a 3.6 in my bioe intro class (i'm not dtc either, hence why i wholeheartedly believe i've now sentenced myself to go nowhere in life) but i decided to s/ns the rest of my classes that term (rest were s's). i thought that would be the end of my dissatisfaction with my performance, but winter quarter took a turn for the worst—i failed all of my classes that quarter, got on academic probation, and subsequently chose to retake the winter courses for the spring term, which i now deem to be a fuck-up as well (2.8, 3.0, and 0.0/r).

i was considering making use of the former quarter drop (fqd) policy for winter quarter because my performance was especially poor; sometime near midterm season, i was roofied and consequently hospitalized—i actually almost passed away (which caused a lot of psychological trauma) but, given the nature of the situation, i feel as if the circumstances are a bit murky and so i've been hesitant to follow through with the entirety of the petition process because i feel like it'll all be in vain.

i'm so sorry for the pathetic ranting but i am truly broken at this point and i am thinking of ending it. i'm not even able to register for autumn 2021 at this point because of administrative holds. honestly, i'm not too sure about what my intentions even are with this post—part of me is desperately searching for reassurance and hope, but i'm crying myself to sleep every night because i know that not only is engineering completely out of the question, but that i'll most likely have to drop out. this is not who i am. i used to be an honor roll student in high school but now i'm on my own with all of my financial aid revoked, planning out how i'm going to leave my family and friends without hurting them too much.

&#x200b;

edit: i've already began the process of trying to lift my registration/financial holds by speaking with my adviser but it's all still... so hopeless

changes since last month:

* more context menu options

* new minimap

* new ability to edit course data

* new option to add courses from text search, which should make it easy to add batches of electives/concentration courses.

* new course table to view all course data in one place.

* added natural sciences, environmental, and informatics majors. but, i'm pretty sure the [data](https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) is outdated, so check before using.

* updated [degree course lists](https://github.com/awu43/prereq-flow-degrees) with course names.

what's still missing:

* grouping — unfortunately, the library i'm using to generate the graphs doesn't support grouping at the moment so there's no easy way to represent a condition like ""10 credits from approved electives"".

* dark mode — it would be nice to have, but fiddling around with colors isn't something i enjoy at all, so probably not going to happen anytime soon.",academics

"best time to take biol 180? hello everyone! i'm an incoming freshman trying to plan out my courses for this year. i need to complete the chem 142 series and biol 180 series to meet my prereqs for my major (microbiology). i've already decided on taking chem 142 this fall quarter. however, i'm not sure when to take bio 180 since i've heard it's quite difficult and i don't want to take the hardest bio course in the series with the hardest chem course in the series. it probably doesn't mean much but i think i'm pretty strong in both chem and bio so i'm more concerned with workload than the difficulty of concepts. any advice?",advice

"what action should i take for an advisor telling me to take the wrong class? my girlfriend is starting her final year before graduation. she decided to set herself up to become a physicians assistant or go to med-school. the decision to take the pre-read for pa school was made recently. so, she spoke with an advisor about what classes she could take this summer quarter to meet the requirements for pa school. this advisor told her she needs to take uw’s physiology class to meet the requirement. long story short, we found out today that pa schools don’t accept this class as a pre-req. uw doesn’t even offer the needed class.

we feel that there can be some sort of action taken because it was pretty obviously bad advising. does anyone have any suggestions?",advice

"has anyone taken honors pchem (chem 475)? out of curiosity, i am wondering what chem 475 (honors physical chemistry) is like. i took/am taking the rest of the honors chem courses (gen/ochem/bioc) and they've been some of the best classes i've taken at uw so far, but it seems like a surprisingly small handful of people take honors pchem (lack of interest from most bio/med students who make up most of the gen/ochem series perhaps?). 

if there's anyone who's taken it, what's the workload like (hrs/week, type of homework?) and what were the main topics covered (if anyone has a syllabus i'd greatly appreciate it). 

on the unlikely off-chance you've taken any of the phys stat mech courses (224/328) and/or the phys quantum courses (225/324/325), how much overlap was there between the material? i'm wondering if it's still worthwhile taking honors pchem if i'll be taking phys 324 and phys 328 already, or if i'm better off taking, like, pchem for biochemists and learning about cool applications that aren't covered in the physics courses. thanks!",academics

"i took cse 143 years ago and i'm still pissed about it the way reges teaches that class is peak bs. it's taught in a way that makes it way, way harder than the material actually is. every assignment is testing you on arbitrary style-points and gotcha-questions. it's literally just some oop and babby's very first data structures but no, let's grade it like a 500-level class just to scare off the riff-raff. if all you cared about was learning java you could just ignore him and go through the book exercises on your own, you'd learn 95% of the material with maybe 10% of the headache.

"in state college or uw? uw is my dream school and i accepted my offer for fall 2021. while i've been planning on going to uw for the last 3 years, i can't ignore the debt that it would put me in, especially being an out of state student. yet i keep getting opportunities to have a cheap tuition if i attend a college in my state, which sounds wonderful, but not as wonderful as attending my dream school. 

i've bought uw merch, visited seattle just so i can get a glimpse of uw life, bragged, came to terms with pre majors and weed off classes, made uw friends, and already found roommates and an off campus apartment to live in. 
but i'd be financially restricted going to uw, i wouldn't be able to enjoy a life aside from college like travelling here and there or during the summer.

 but then there's the option to attend college where i live for two years then transfer to uw and my debt wouldn't be as big plus i'd have more money in my pocket for whatever. i know it would be a huge financial relief and my future self would appreciate it but it would also be a personal let down for me.

advice please.

edit: 
thank you all!!! i really appreciate the advice and all the input you guys gave. it was a lot to think about and also a lot more factors to consider. just thank you guys so much! 

my final decision is that for my first two years of college, i'd spend it at uw. while this doesn't eliminate the chance for debt it shouldn't be too high either. then after uw i can transfer to my state school. it sounds backwards, i know, but this way i at least get to experience being a student at uw (and have a legit reason for my uw merch) and after having my fill, i go back home where the cheap tuition is.",advice
"help! looking to rent in the fall but reading terrible reviews of apartments and freaking out hey everyone, so i (23f, grad student at uw) will be moving to udistrict on september 1st and i am looking for a 2 bedroom apartment to share with my roommate. we had narrowed it down to 2 places called college place apartments or campus view apartments. i just thought to check reviews before picking one to begin the application process for and they are appalling.

both apartments are located on the west of campus which seems to be rife with theft, crimes, break-ins, and homeless people? reviews are either really good (like, 5-star good which seem kind of fake or written by management, i don't know what to believe) or they're horrid, lambasting every feature of the apartment. i couldn't find any other apartment with a decent rating in a 0.75 mile radius of the campus either. is this the reality of off-campus housing in seattle? i have night classes and need to be within walking distance (<1mi) because i don't have a car.

"advice for students moving to campus for the first time that i wish i was given when i was a freshman. hfs gives stupid advice and product recommendations. your ras are knowledgeable, but they're not the ones in control of the handbooks or websites. this is a collection of random tips i've accumulated in my time living at uw, and from friends of mine at uw and other colleges.  

&#x200b;

dorm supplies:

&#x200b;

***do not waste your money on ocm. i assume hfs gets a cut of sales, because the products are garbage.***

&#x200b;

for bedding, look on amazon, there are tons of twin xl (the size uw beds are) options there for far cheaper and with a better return policy than ocm (the company hfs shills for). buy a pillow online, at target, or bring one from home. i promise you they will be higher quality than ocm.

&#x200b;

for towels, go to target or, if you can, costco. the towels at costco are dirt cheap and very high quality. buy two bath towels and a dish towel. you can buy a bath mat, but i would just dry off in the shower and save the $8. 

&#x200b;

**for any kind of kitchenware, go to target.** i was able to buy one bowl, one plate, one dish, one fork, one knife, and one spoon for cheap. i recommend bringing some kind of thermos or travel mug to fill up on the free coffee in the dining halls in the morning to avoid buying the exact same coffee at starbucks for $5. 

&#x200b;

miscellaneous tips:

\-***don't buy the expensive dining plan.*** i was duped into thinking it was the best option before i set foot on campus (you've probably read the hfs guide saying that anything less than the level 4 will leave you without food half the time, that's complete bunk.) the food on campus is ok at best and very cheap. a meal costs around $8 at most, more with sides, so the $1100 or whatever the level 1 is plan will cover quite a lot. 

&#x200b;

\-additionally, you're in seattle. you're a 10 minute walk or a 20 minute bus ride from some of the best food in the world. don't waste all your college meals on a greasy sub-mcdonalds quality burger. 

&#x200b;

\-your dining account can be used at the district market (on-campus grocery store). i wouldn't use actual money here, as its almost all 10-40% more expensive than any other grocery store, but it's a good way to burn the money you won't want to use on junky fast food. 

&#x200b;

\-**amazon is your friend.** you will forget things. you will break things. you'll be living in seattle so 90% of packages will be able to be delivered next day, or if you're really lucky, later the same day. if you don't have prime but your parents do, have them set up amazon household, which will give you access to free prime shipping.

&#x200b;

\-**bring batteries and lightbulbs.** these are both weirdly expensive around the university, so buy them and bring them.

&#x200b;

\-**lighting is a must.** the dorms can get really dark and depressing, especially in overcast seattle winter, which is all of seattle winter. i wouldn't necessarily go so far as to spend $50 on a ""mood lamp"", but some fairy lights, desk lamps, floor lamps, or, if you're so inclined and your roommate doesn't object (ask first) tiktok style leds.

&#x200b;

\-on the same line as lighting, **bring a plant**. studies have repeatedly shown increased mood, energy, and focus in people who have leafy plants in their environments as compared to those who do not. pothos, lucky bamboo, and fiddleleaf fig are all pretty cheap and easy to care for. spend 10 minutes researching them so you don't kill them instantly and you'll be golden.

&#x200b;

\-laundry. doesn't have to be tide, but **any laundry pod is a lifesaver for dorm laundry.** you don't want to haul a 2 gallon jug of detergent up 5 flights of stairs (unless you're trying to get a leg workout in, in which case go for it). i have a collapsible hamper so i would often bring my laundry down with a pod or two, start it going,  put the hamper in my backpack, then go get lunch on the ave.

&#x200b;

\-**if you need a mini fridge, see if you can buy used.** i paid $50 on facebook marketplace for one that retails for $200. it's a little late now, but graduates often get rid of theirs at the end of the year. facebook marketplace is a great place to start looking. 

&#x200b;

\-**get a coffee maker / electric kettle.** either of these will pay for themselves in a month if you drink a lot of tea, coffee, or cocoa (also good for ramen).

&#x200b;

if you're not sure if you'll need something or not, err on the side of conservativism. dorms are small. you don't want to be like i was and have a bunch of storage bins full of junk i never used, or even wanted to use. save your money on the front end, don't buy a rice cooker and a, instant pot and an air fryer and a frying pan and 50 other things ""just in case"". if you realize you need something, buy it on amazon, or go to the store. if seattle seems expensive, hop on a bus (if i recall correctly the 522 or the 255 will work) and go to bellevue, kirkland, or redmond. on top of seeing more of the area if you're not from here, these towns can be much cheaper (also typically safer for walking alone but that's another issue for another post) than anywhere in seattle, and unlimited bus fare is included in tuition. 

&#x200b;

**off topic but maybe helpful bits of wisdom**

&#x200b;

**-**i always keep a few $1 bills in a pocket with nothing else in it when i'm walking around. this way, if one of the many many beggars around the ave or seattle in general comes up and asks, or worse, demands money, i can hand them a small amount without pulling out my whole wallet or risking dropping stuff. you will be asked for money. sometimes, you will be asked for money in a very forceful way. one wants to assume these are people down on their luck with the best intentions, but the reality is some are dangerous. **never pull out your wallet when giving an unhoused person or beggar money.** many are good people on bad times, some are not. 

&#x200b;

\-this applies to anyone, but especially those who are women or minorities of any kind, and those who are less physically intimidating. **avoid walking alone** off or near campus. the campus proper is fairly safe, but you go one street in any direction and all bets are off. do not walk alone, do not walk with headphones on, and do not walk at night. ensure bags are secure and closed. probably, you'll never have a problem. expect the best and plan for the worst. 

&#x200b;

\-**don't study in your dorm**. i could wax poetic about sleep hygiene all day but it boils down to this: don't use spaces for all purposes. sleep in your sleeping space, relax in your relaxation space, study in your study space. there are libraries for studying. they're very nice. use them. you will be more productive, i promise.

&#x200b;

\-**find your people.** don't rely on highschool friends alone for socialization in college. join a club you're genuinely passionate about, not that you think would look cool to be in. personally, i've made all my friends at uw through dungeons and dragons. anything that forces groups of 3-6 people together to interact on any personal level will absolutely build relationships. i might make a whole other post about this later. 

&#x200b;

i didn't set out with the intent to write this long of a post (in fact this was originally going to be a 1 paragraph psa about the dining level) but these are genuinely all things that if i had known going into college my first year i would have been much better off. hopefully this will help at least one person with at least one thing and if it does, it was worth it. if you have any other tips (the real lpt is always in the comments) i'll add them to the list with credit. feel free to repost or plagiarize any of this, if it would help more people know what they're doing.",advice

"advice to deal with exam regrets hello everyone,

i need some serious advice right now. so about a week and a half ago, i had a physics 116 exam that didn't go as well as i expected. i was super bummed because the exam seemed easy enough when i was doing it but my score said otherwise. the answer key was released over the weekend and i made the unfortunate decision to take a look at what i got wrong. i don't know why i did this to myself but now i can't stop thinking about it.

for those who don't know how the physics exams work - we have 20 questions, each 5 points so essentially each question is worth 5%. after looking at my exam, i realized that i somehow made 3 of the stupidest mistakes ever which caused me to lose 15 points and hence 15% (i got 75% but could've gotten 90%). i don't even know how i missed those because i got them correct when i redid them and i have been feeling really guilty.

now, every time i try to study physics, that keeps popping up in my brain and i feel like its eating m alive - honestly.

i just feel so guilty and am so scared about the next exam and what might happen there. because of my bad score here, i need to ace my next exam so that i can still get the grade that i want/need in that class.

for instance, if you pay $200 per quarter, they say that means you have about $9/day. but if you pay 3x as much ($600) you have only 1.2x as much budget per day ($11). or if you pay 11x as much ($2,339), you get 3.5x more per day ($31).

so… what am i missing? how exactly are the dining hall accounts translated to available funds for the dining halls?",student life

2. i’ve been looking at the pathways for my desired major on the uw website and how do i know whether to choose the general/honors pathway (ie. for chem) i plan on emailing an advisor to hopefully provide some advice but tbh i’ve heard they’re not always that helpful. 
3. i think i will take 15 credits total this first quarter because of the transition from high school to college. do u think 1 stem class is adequate? i don’t want to take 2 and overwork myself

"why does it feel like it is impossible to find furnished housing in the area? i am an incoming ph.d. student, and i am finding this housing search to be way more difficult than it was for my undergraduate institution. in particular, for some reason, furnished housing seems to be incredibly rare for anywhere besides the on-campus apartments (which are all booked up anyways). 

this is quite inconvenient for me because i intend to work internships every summer that would very likely not be in the area, during which time i would (ideally) like to either have my place leased out or only sign a 9-month lease. in either case, a pre-furnished apartment would make things a lot easier.

right now, i'm in engrud and finished all of the requirements to place into 6 engineering majors (hopefully aero/astro) except for engr 101. a lot of the next classes i would be taking for aerospace engineering were already full when i registered, so i did what i could to find classes that would still be interesting:

"my advice for incoming freshmen attending uw (part 1) going to college is not an easy thing because you'll face numerous invisible challenges starting your first quarter or semester. and your first year is the foundation for the entire undergraduate career, so some silly mistakes will cost you. as a rising sophomore this fall at the university of washington, here are my genuine advice on how to effectively and joyfully spend your first year. i hope it's helpful!

​

# 1. start connecting your classmates before the year begins

you'll very likely to find the group chat on the internet after you accepted the enrollment, or even before the admission cycle closed. social media platforms like discord, facebook, or loopchat usually have a big group chat that includes every member of the incoming class (if they get admitted), and some of the people in the group chat may still waitlisted. getting to know each other from here is a great opportunity, you will know people with various majors. later in the spring, you'll start to apply for the housing, and the best way is to reach out people, as many as possible. having your first group of college friends makes you advantaged than those who do not. simply, don't wait until the fall and panic.

​

# 2. do not pack your entire home to the dorm

as an international student from china, i was worried that i cannot get specific items abroad when packing for my first year of studying in 2016, so i literally squeezed as many things as possible into two 28-inch suitcases. unfortunately, my assumption was wrong. i can purchase all my stationaries, cookware, bedding supplies, and any general items at walmart, target, and many grocery stores. i understand you concern about cannot getting something you desire, but the university of washington itself is urban-setting, which you can get things you need within walkable distance. lastly, things like power outlet, bedding supplies, and clothes are made differently in the u.s., and i do not want you to unwillingly throw your stuff away if it doesn't fit.

​

# 3. the best way to beat homesickness is stay active

if you're an international or out-of-state student, you will probably hit a wall at sometime during the fall or early winter due to a combination of factors, which could be homesickness. this could happen anytime during the year when you feel unable to handle the cultural differences, language barriers, academic pressure, and loneliness. at this point, don't freak out. negative emotions and attitudes can adversely affect your mental health and academic success. now it's the time to talk to people around you, attend collegiate athletic events, join the student organizations, and do not stay inside your dorm 15 hours a day! social life and self-adjustment are the only ways can help you. once you get engaged, you will realize time pasts really fast.

​

# 4. take the entire core sequence courses if possible

lots of public flagship universities may have introductory sequence courses, especially for stem subjects, and those classes can be extremely challenging compared to some upper-division classes. the math 124-5-6 (introductory calculus sequence, also called math 12x) at uw is known for its rigor and students with ap calculus scores can directly jump into math 125 or math 126. but i strongly recommend you restart the sequence even you have ap calculus credits. math 12x courses are taught twice as fast as typical high school ap classes with higher expectations, if you don't get used to the college teaching style, you will not doing great even you already know the entire curriculum of math 12x. you need study skills to survive.

​

# 5. tenured professors are not always have fantastic teaching skills

sadly, you're less likely to have a ""teacher"" at uw or any large public universities, especially in stem classes. universities like uw and uc always hire professors to do specific researches for their departments, and the departments rarely offer specialized training on teaching. this results some professors are expertise in their fields but have zero experiences on teaching. they can teach classes, but not as good as your high school calculus teacher. they are paid for the research, not all the classes taught during the academic year. you cannot flip the professor's teaching style, so i suggest you either switch to another section, work hard with your classmates, or wait till next academic term. complaining doesn't solve anything.

​

# 6. make friends with common interests and hobbies only

college campus is huge enough to have people from different cultural backgrounds, so it's obvious that we will meet lots of ""weird"" people around. i know some incoming freshmen tend to blend in no matter what, to get them socially engaged. socializing is really fun, but sometimes it can be devastating if we used inappropriate manners. if you made a bunch of friends and found yourself unpleasant, steer clear. found something that fits your interest, go for it. in college campuses, the quality of your friends could influence your future development. a high-quality friend circle will help you building solid network beyond college, even for the entire life. ",student life

"dorm inspections? i asked a few weeks ago about the viability of bringing a large ant farm with me when i move on campus. the resounding consensus was that hfs would not approve of this in the slightest. while i am currently in negotiations with a buyer in oklahoma, he won't be able to take it until october, meaning i'll have to have it with me in my dorm room for at least a few weeks. furthermore, i am currently conducting research involving alcohol's impact on ant tunneling patterns, and would need to have a bottle of vodka with me in the dorm room at all times. i imagine getting caught with these things could prove disastrous. do hfs people actually come inspect people's dorm rooms regularly? if so, is it easy to conceal things (including mini-fridge sized ant farms)?

"my advice for incoming freshmen attending uw (part 2) again, those are just my personal perspectives, not accurately reflect everyone's situation,

&#x200b;

# 7. stay conscious all the time when off-campus

many public universities such as the university of washington (seattle), university of minnesota (twin cities), and new york university, have its campus in urban settings, which means the campus is no difference from a city neighborhood. there's no fences around (columbia university in nyc is an exception), so you're responsible for protecting yourself. regardless when you're walking on the ave (university way), put away your cellphone and headphone and refrain yourself from carrying large amounts of cash (anything exceeds $200). also, for those who have chemistry or physics lab sections ending past 8:30pm or want late-night social life, i recommend not to wear some luxurious or attractive outfits. don't make yourself being a target, it's not good.

​

# 8. buy a cheap bike with an expensive lock (even multiple)

getting your bike stolen creates unnecessary burden to your life, but bike thefts are preventable. i reviewed all the incidents reported to uwpd from september 2020 to july 2021, most of the bike thefts were happened in west campus dorm and its surrounding, parking lots, life science building, light rail station, and the medicine building. those places are either have beautiful scene or always crowded. the best way is to buy a cheap bike (from walmart, or less than $500) with a few expensive locks (one u-lock and one combination lock). and never set password as something like 1-1-1-1 or 1-2-3-4, those passwords not help. lastly, put your bike with others, or take a picture if possible. once you noticed something suspicious, report to uwpd immediately. one of my friends in minneapolis suffered from bike lost this summer multiple times, so i want give a warning on those who want to get expensive ones.

​

# 9. some good professors may not be help for your grades

the stem weedouts at uw have horror stories, and most of it comes from phys 12x and math 12x sequences. and lots of my friends were seeking professor andrew loveless' class (math 126 this past year) after seeing some comments on ratemyprofessor. however, if you're not smart as those applying for cs or acms, rusty test-taking strategies, or want stellar grades, then a good professor may not help you. first, good professors making the concepts digestible so most of the class can easily understand. second, grades are curved, so if you made some silly mistakes (like 1+1=3), your grade will be lower than you expected. lastly, great professor usually has brutal curve, especially in math 12x. terrible professors have hard exam but more rooms for making mistakes. my math 124 professor yu yuan was terrible at lecturing but i ended up with a decent grade.

​

# 10. never staying up late when you have exam in the upcoming day

before the midterm or the final exam, we're all stressed because we want to do well. however, if you desire the best performance on the exam, then please do not be the ""all nighter"" beforehand, even your exam is not in the morning (before 10:30am). cramming exams will only increase your anxiety rather than calming down. when i know my midterm is coming, i start learning and reviewing about 5–10 days ahead and on the day before the exam, i sleep at latest 12am. you don't like the drowsy feeling when taking the exam, do you? college is already stressful enough, adding extra stress will adversely affect your exam performance and mental health. in general, regardless of when your exam starts, never stay up late and begging for retake afterward.",advice

"potential vaccine difficulties hello uw people,

i wanted to mention that the policies of the uw and/or wa may require students to have either: 1) proof of full vaccination or 2) proof of a negative covid19 result within the last seven days (using pcr). these policies may be in lieu of a mandate, and instead may increase vaccination adoption due to the inconvenience of getting a pcr test each week. the biden administration is requiring businesses with federal contracts and federal workers to have either proof of vaccination or negative covid19 test via the [july 29th order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-new-actions-to-get-more-americans-vaccinated-and-slow-the-spread-of-the-delta-variant/).

other countries have similar policies, but they are generally for the entry into their borders, and not necessarily for each entry into a building. czechia [has a similar order to the biden administration](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/file/protective-measure-of-the-ministry-of-healthcare-against-sars-cov-2.aspx), in which residents and foreigners may be asked to present either a negative covid19 pcr test within the last seven days, or proof of vaccination. the link above will take you to the czechia pdf, and i believe the applicable order is i. 4c.

"an open letter the university of washington the university of washington has condemned me and other disabled students with immune deficiency, as well as their families. every 12 hours i take two medications to prevent my body from recognizing foreign solid organs that i received as part of a transplant. because of this, i am more susceptible to covid-19 and other infectious diseases, something i have known for a long time. what many don’t know is that an additional consequence of these medications is reduced vaccine efficacy. i have received two doses, a booster, and have had covid-19, and i still lack the antibodies to fight the disease.

the university of washington, like many other universities across the country, has opted for in-person learning this fall. most students and faculty are eager for the opportunity to be back on campus. however, the harsh reality for some is that the options provided by the university are subpar, dangerous, and are directly against access to learning for all students. i know i am not the only student with an immune deficiency, and i know that there are students with family members who are immune deficient.

the options before myself, as presented by the drs, are as follows: hope that professors are willing to alter their course structures significantly to accommodate a single student, take less courses, request accommodations through the drs which they have stated will be extremely limited and hard to acquire, or take the quarter off. most of these place undue stress on students and instructors, both emotionally as well as financially.

with little over a month until the beginning of fall quarter, myself and my living partner have had no access to resources to protect ourselves from covid-19 on campus. i have options, as listed above, however, my partner  — who sleeps next to me — has been told that there are no options for them, because they have no disability, making what little accommodations provided to myself useless so long as my partner must return to in-person learning.

i thank all the professors and advisors who’ve been corresponding with my partner and i this summer, trying to help in any way possible, and informing us that the university refuses to provide professors with guidance and resources for specific cases. this is the direct responsibility of the university, to provide guidance for student and faculty guidance, and reassurances that they will support all types of learning to guarantee that students can become educated in the safest and most effective way possible.

so while summer winds its way to a close and we continue to sit at home keeping our minds and bodies as active in any safe manner possible, the fall looms with unanswered questions, anxiety about more than assignments, and a sadness that the university i was once so proud to be a part of has become such a risk.

"advice to my younger freshman self... ...from future you, who's been on campus for less than 2 quarters

1. please read up what panic attacks and anxiety looks like. cause when you took only half an edible and freaked out, you could've saved money by not going to the hospital. general rule of thumb, don't do anything new drug wise by yourself 

2. i don't care how cute it was when your first date with that junior was watching atla, trust him when he says he doesn't want a relationship. you're only hurting by staying and he is definitely not changing for you lol

3. make multiple friend groups. not just that group of people on your floor who gush about superbad. because trust me if (actually when) that group falls apart you're going to feel like the whole world is ending. make friends everywhere and you're going to be just fine

4. that best friend 3,000 miles away from you? not worth staying in your room convincing her to video call when friends at your door are holding snacks and ice cream because they wanted to support you during that friend breakup. sometimes you outgrow people from your past and that's ok. it just means you're getting closer to being the person you're meant to be 

5. don't walk alone at night on the ave and greek row. if that boy cared about you, he would've cared about your safety

6. flick the bean in the morning. don't care how horny you are because 2 seconds away from finishing you're going to accidently make eye contact with your roommate who also thought you were sleeping...

7. 4am at ode with friends and strangers is going to make you happier than that one frat party 

8. stop taking school so serious and get out of your room. trust yourself that the after class revision was enough 

9. water and center table's scrambled eggs the next morning. your keys are in the fridge btw

10. ice in that drink! don't grind on the guy dressed up as harry potter! go with three friends if you anticipate going home with some other girl!

10. actually no take your studies seriously. after that first midterm, midterm season doesn't stop until 2 weeks before the end of quarter. get back on that smh

11. just know no matter what you did your best. you aren't perfect and no one is. even that girl who seems to have everything (4.0 in cse, a bf, perfect outfits, perfect body, etc.) focus on doing your best.

12. stop taking everything so goddamn personal. you aren't the moon kissing the night sky. you have to sing under the sea with all your heart. you have to shovel cheerios 2 mins before your 8:30 because you know you aren't going to function later. you have to pause for a minute and just admire those corgis. you have to stop spending hours after a test figuring out your grade and then your back up major. you've got to stop trying to make your neighbors like you. fuck it kid. you've got to love yourself.

13. i'm proud of you even if mom doesn't tell you. your value doesnt go down when she yells at you for not carrying your tracker (sorry i mean cellular device) everywhere. you aren't a whore

14. that guy from madrona? that girl from calc? those people you randomly met? i can't wait for you to get to know them because you're going to find so much love. open your heart to then and watch how you heal in a healthy environment. you deserve this

15. be boundless even if the campaign ends next year",advice

"how to get a credible esa letter (that works for uw on-campus housing and maybe off-campus housing)? hi, i have mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and i'd really like to get a pet during college to relax and ground me, especially because i'll be moving on-campus and having college classes in person for the first time. last year was my first year in college and i did distance learning living at home with my dysfunctional family :') and a week or two ago i went to the mall with my friends and got really burnt out for approximately two days just because i had too many ""hello, welcome to the store, are you looking for anything today?"" ""no, we're just browsing, thank you so much!"" interactions 💀, so the prospect of moving on-campus and having classes in person is very stressful for me. 

i messaged my doctor about having an emotional support animal as an option to support my mental health (they were the one who diagnosed me and also prescribed me medication, which has improved my baseline level of stress and speed of recovery from things like spirals, but i am still mentally ill, i'm sure), but i was told it was their organization's policy to not provide esa letters and they referred me to another organization to connect me to a therapist who would meet my needs. however, that organization told me that ""most providers will not see a patient just for a letter but are willing to write one after a few sessions if the patient plans on continuing seeing them for long term therapy"" and i'm not really certain that long term therapy is for me in terms of my finances and my specific relationship with my mental health. 

when i told them about my situation and ambivalence about long term therapy, they said that they could help me find a long term therapy provider, or if i only want an esa letter, to get one through esa doggy. however, some quick google searches say that esa doggy is maybe not legit and other esa letter websites say that they're legit, but other's aren't (and they throw shade at each other, though they also all claim to connect people to a local licensed professional who is qualified to write an esa letter), and some places say that no esa letters provided through online means are legit so 🤡.

i'd really appreciate if a current or recent uw student could tell me about how the process works and how i can obtain a legit esa letter. i'm also going to be rooming with some friends this year on campus and one of them is on the fence about having a pet in their space because we have to share a room (which is fair and i respect that) so we wanted to wait until the end of autumn quarter and get an esa during the winter break, and i wanted to get the approval process done ahead of time because i thought it might take a while, so i have some time to find figure out what's best for me and to deliberate. the esa will also likely be a crested gecko because my one of my roommates is allergic to furry pets and after a lot of research, i currently feel like it would be the best pet i could care for that also fits my needs.

 tldr: can any current/recent uw student tell me about the process to getting a legit esa letter",advice

"going back on campus (rant + advice for incoming students) i have been abroad working in a few countries in northern africa the last few months and i am so excited to come back for fall quarter. i am genuinely giddy. my god i miss everyone so much. not just my friends that i haven’t seen the last few months but the pre-covid university atmosphere and every little great and shitty thing that comes with it. 

like many people here, i am definitely a little nervous going back in person. but my sheer joy currently is overruling every other emotion i am currently experiencing. 

for those of you who are anxious though and have not been on campus previously, here is an (unsolicited) message for you: you are not alone and don’t let the overwhelming, big school atmosphere paralyze you. 

while i don’t believe in fate, i believe that because uw is so big and provides so many opportunities that there truly is a community for everyone, you just have to take the time to find it. 

if this is your first quarter on campus, slow down, remember to breathe, and remember that everyone takes different periods of time to adjust to new environments. 

also, if any new foster students have any questions about getting adjusted or just want to talk, dm me. i am also always free for a coffee chat in paccar :) 

much love and hope to see everyone on campus",student life

"everything we learned at efs some of the freshmen i've met online have a lot of questions about moving on campus, so my friend and my roommate and i got together and created a master list of everything that we learned at efs. 

**what to pack:** 

1. bring more masks than you think you’ll need.
   1. bring all the masks. you will wear them all the time. bring disposable ones for emergencies, and reusable ones so you don't go broke buying disposable ones. right now, uw requires students to wear masks in lounges, laundry rooms, basically anywhere that's not your dorm or outside. you will need masks. 
2. a fan. 
   1. it will probably cool off soon, but climate change is kicking my southern butt right now. there is no air conditioning, so it can get hot and sweaty in the dorms. if you have room, bring one. 
3. hand sanitizer. 
   1. especially the mini-bottles that you can carry with you. 
4. card games, if you have them.
   1. they’re a great way to make friends. the best ones are cards against humanity, catan, and uno. so far, i've made, like, five friends with cah. 
5. headphones. 
   1. invest in nice, noise-canceling ones if you can; it will be helpful if the dorms are a little loud. they’re also essential for zoom calls in rooms you share with other people. 
6. deodorant. 
   1. this is a no-brainer, but please bring deodorant. because the dorms get hot, people get sweaty, and when people get sweaty, people get smelly. my roommate gets very sweaty, and their use of deodorant is very much appreciated. 
7. a cart/bin/drawers to use as a pantry/medicine cabinet.
   1. check with your roommate(s) if you want to share one. my roommate and i share a chart that has our snacks and meds on it and it is very useful. 
8. a very basic toolkit; you’ll never know when you’ll need a screwdriver. 
9. toilet paper (if you have a private bathroom)
   1. the bathrooms don’t come with toilet paper and you’re going to need a lot more than you realize. 
10. cleaning supplies 
   1. you'll also like having a clean dorm, so bring clorox wipes, or cleaning spray, or magic erasers, or whatever you use.  you also may need wipes to clean up the kitchen when someone inevitably leaves half their lunch all over the counter. 
11. extra phone/computer/ipad charger.
   1. currently, my friend gage has a dead phone and is sitting in my room charging said phone because he locked himself out of his dorm and forgot his charger. don't be like gage. also, get a portable charger if you can. good for long classes and long days out. 
12. a surge protector extension cord (maybe even two?)
   1. there are like, two power outlets per person in each dorm and you will be plugging a lot of stuff in. 
13. slides/slippers.
   1. shoes that are easy to pull on. they’re good for going to do laundry, running out real quick, etc. 
14. britta water filter pitcher 
   1. the tap water here sucks booty. water filter pitchers are great because you can put them in the fridge and have cold water for your water bottle. if you don't bring one, you can get one at target. this is also a good thing to buy with your roommate, as you'll *both* be using it often. 
15. reusable bags. essential for grocery shopping, farmer’s market runs, thrifting, etc. 
16. shower caddy.
   1. if you have your own bathroom, get one that you can stick to the wall or hang on the showerhead. there’s not much space to put your soap in the shower, so a caddy is essential. 

**what to buy here (or bring beforehand, i'm not stopping you)** 

1. mini-fridge
   1. some people recommend renting a mini-fridge, and that is helpful because you don’t have to worry about installing it. the only downside is that one person on our floor still hasn’t gotten his mini-fridge yet and it's been three weeks. not sure what's going on there. if you do decide to buy a mini-fridge, make sure to check in with your roommate to make sure they didn’t get a mini-fridge yet. 
2. microwave
   1. see mini-fridge. on a side note, if you’re cheap and want to save money, check to see if your floor lounge has a microwave. some do, some don’t, and sometimes the ones that do are used a lot. a good thing to consider. 
3. cooking supplies. 
   1. you won’t cook too often, but it is nice making your own food or cooking with friends once in a while. for those occasions, one pot and one pan are enough. again, it may be a good idea to buy and share cooking supplies with your roommate. 
4. extra hangers. 
   1. if you like hanging your clothes up, you may need extra for when you buy school t-shirts or go thrifting. 
5. paper towels
   1. you will use them all the time. you’ll clean with them, use them as plates, use them as emergency toilet paper, etc. very, very useful. 
6. air freshener if you have a smelly roommate (or if you’re the smelly roommate).

**general tips**

1. you won’t use as much husky card money as you think, but also note district market is hella overpriced. 
2. please. for the love of jesus christ superstar clean up after using the kitchen. don’t be the asshole who puts his leftover rice in the goddamn sink and not in the garbage disposal or trash and leaves sauce stains all over the stove. 
   1. i’m not salty at all. 
3. don’t feel obligated to talk to people on your floor who make you uncomfortable. you don’t have to talk to them; hang out with people you actually like. 
   1. furthermore, never be afraid to leave a social event where you don’t feel comfortable. 
4. get used to walking and walking a lot. 
   1. also, figure out how long it takes to get to places you’ll go often, especially target or starbucks. seattle is very hilly, so half a mile can feel more like two miles. 
5. eating out is fun, but make sure to keep an eye on how much you’re spending. you will probably accidentally spend more than you realize. 
6. there is a difference between your husky card balance and your dining card balance. 
   1. your husky card balance is for laundry and the bookstore. it is easy to load up with the money. your dining card balance is for any food on campus and district market. they are two different accounts but you use the same card. 
7. light-rail is very fun. going to phoenix comic bookstore in capitol hill is also very fun. they have magic the gathering commander nights on wednesdays but get there early because spots fill up quickly. 
8. figure out where your classes are before your classes.  
9. have a diverse diet. eat the occasional fruit/vegetable you heathen. that way you don’t feel like shit all the time. 
10. steal your parents’ netflix password before you leave for school. it’s awkward to ask for it after you get to school. 
11. the varsity theatre has very cheap tickets for popular movies, but the movie theatre is very dark and the picture is usually very dim and hard to see (especially if it’s a darker movie like a dc flick), plus the speakers are painfully loud. 
12. don’t isolate yourself first weeks. no one has friends the first week. go and talk to people you friggin bean. everyone is looking to make friends the first week so don’t be shy. 

there's also a lovely google doc master post that was super helpful for my packing experience: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/19i1ucnsehjyqmesolgorspw7boudkube-tuude6kmvg/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19i1ucnsehjyqmesolgorspw7boudkube-tuude6kmvg/mobilebasic)

"kinda regret the choices i make 
i’m an international transfer student who is supposed to come to campus this fall but there is a covid outbreak in my city so the chance of me traveling to the united states is very low. the government closed the highways, train station to general public so it’s extremely difficult for me to leave the city, but it’s still possible. and the government is not likely to lift the lockdown before september 29 which is the time the classes start.

also, i won’t be able to travel after sep 29 because the cbp will most likely deny my entry.

i emailed the admissions several times and they got back to me with the same response: 
“in general, uw does not grant deferrals. if we do not offer any remote course options and you are unable to travel to the u.s. by september 29, you may request a deferral.”

with the shitty things happening, i don’t feel like attending the uw that much though it was my dream school.

here are my options:

1. register for one online class and retain my admission spot and see if i can travel to the united states in winter. but then i’ll have to pay thousands of dollars in tuition for a class i don’t even need, and 3 months of expensive housing because of the lease contract. or defer the fall admission which is very unlikely according to the admissions.

2. withdrawal from the university and reapply for another university i favored in canada. by doing this i’m essentially taking a gap year, and i might do some interns during this time. 

i’m considering the second option because my plan was to study in canada when i graduate from uw, so i might as well go there two years ahead and i get to study in the major i like instead of the back up major at uw. but that would definitely extend my time as an undergrad.

i kinda regret the choices i made this year and i really don’t know what to do. things suck",advice

"stay safe on the ave guys! so, yesterday, after a night of fun and excitement, i decided to refill my stomach with some late night tacos at memos and headed over there. while i was waiting in line, one guy was pushed into the shop by a shirtless guy violently. the shirtless guy started pummeling the other one with punches around and around the floor for what seemed like a good five minutes before he was called out by his companions and left. during the fight, plastic signboards were thrown, chairs shoved and the customers of the restaurant were invisible to the attackers eyes.

but that wasn't the end of my crazy night. immediately after the scene and the actors cleared up, another guy entered the shop through the open window, moved a chair around to the garbage disposal at the center of the restaurant, dug though the trash and started drinking something he found in there. he ambled around for a few minutes, picked up and pocketed what seemed like a knife to me and tried to sneak away with takeout boxes. he was stopped by one of the restaurant workers on his way out and gave up though.

i had to wait a good five to ten minutes for my order to be complete and then left for home. on my way out who do i see? the same actors still roaming about on the ave. with a lot of new students coming in, this is just a reminder to stay safe, avoid sketchy areas, not venture out too late alone or to move in groups at such times. be boundless guys!!",student life

"advice/guide to new uw students this is dedicated to people that want to maximize their college experience and either come from nothing and/or really just wanna run it up 💰make the most of all the tuition you’re paying already lol might as well 🤷🏽‍♂️

i’m a senior my final quarter in uw cse. i’m mexican and my family efc is $0 so i come from the bottom of the bottom. this has been the biggest advantage for me going into uw cse, as i’ve found more doors opened for me than i could have ever dreamed of. i’m a grinder, so i spent so much time maximizing the resources here.

you're gonna meet the smartest people you've ever met in your life, and once you graduate you're gonna have connections to every big company all over the world. here’s some of the things i’ve learned over my years here:

\*note this is especially helpful for cs/info majors but doesn’t mean you can’t look into it too :)

&#x200b;

1. **social + study**: use the pomodoro study technique or find something that works. talk to as many people in your classes as you can, f\*\*\* being shy it'll pay off pretty hard early on you'll see. make study groups whenever you can, a lot of people don't talk to each other especially in the beginning so just ask anyone to study w u and they'll almost always say yes. you can reserve some of the really nice study spaces around campus here (not all are open cuz covid): [lib.washington.edu/services/spaces/study](http://lib.washington.edu/services/spaces/study). use the academic support programs! its free homework and class help from people that know their stuff that can get you through basically every intro class and well into your major: [academicsupport.washington.edu](http://academicsupport.washington.edu/).
2. **more social:** there’s even a bowling alley, e-sports room, and arcade to hang out at: [hub.washington.edu/play](http://hub.washington.edu/play). canoes and kayaks at the waterfront: [washington.edu/ima/waterfront/boat-rentals](http://washington.edu/ima/waterfront/boat-rentals). explore the ave w someone, find your fav food places.
3. **fitness:** go to the gym please. don’t even have to go crazy hard, you’re already paying for it in tuition so go on the treadmill for 30min after class every day. you’ll be feeling amazing in no time. there’s intermural sports leagues for anyone that wants to play a sport regularly but isn’t pro. there’s rock climbing, swimming, martial arts, yoga, archery, even a golf range, you name it they most likely got it: [washington.edu/ima](http://washington.edu/ima).
4. **clubs**: there’s an insane amount of clubs so just spend a day going through this directory and find something that interests you: [huskylink.washington.edu](http://huskylink.washington.edu/). you can make electric cars, bikes, your own canoe, and a bunch of other clubs that look insanely good on a resume + there's some just plain fun ones (find people in your niche like movie club).
5. **health:** use hall health’s resources. schedule times during your quarter to talk to a psychologist, getting your mental on point is key to everything. you also get one free checkup per quarter. also they got free condoms (stay safe y’all)!!
6. **food:** there’s a really nice free(!!!) food pantry that every uw student get access to once a week: [washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry](http://washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry). you can also sign up for snap benefits (free money to spend on food every month) if you’re at least part time: [washington.edu/financialaid/types-of-aid/food-stamps](http://washington.edu/financialaid/types-of-aid/food-stamps).
7. **electronics:** you don’t have to buy almost any electronic. you can rent really nice cameras (started me off on my pro photography journey), laptops, lighting equipment for potential yt channels or tiktoks, calculators, tablets (including the new ipad pro), speakers, projectors, mics, and even vr headsets: [stlp.uw.edu](https://stlp.uw.edu). allowed me to save up enough money until i could get my own (theres also student discounts at the microsoft and apple store among others). i’m a computer expert so lmk if you need help buying something.
8. **maker space + studio:** uw maker space ([hfs.uw.edu/the-mill/maker-space](http://hfs.uw.edu/the-mill/maker-space)) offers 3d printers, vinyl cutters, computers w free adobe software, sewing and embroidery machines, and even circuit board stations among others. between this and #7 you can literally start your own online company. there’s also a **music** **studio** w all the equipment you’d ever need to record songs or just mess around in. pretty crazy.
9. **credit card:** drop whatever you're doing and get a credit card (start once you’re 18), get this one its for people that don't have credit yet: [**discover.com/credit-cards/secured/**](http://discover.com/credit-cards/secured/)
10. **coding\*:** literally spend your free time on [**leetcode.com**](http://leetcode.com/) just practicing coding questions, the earlier you get an internship the easier it'll be to get future ones. look through harvard cs50's course to get a good start on fundamentals. sign up for dubhacks even if you don’t know s\*\*\*, i met a bunch of really cool juniors and seniors that guided me my first year even though i didn’t have experience: [dubhacks.co](http://dubhacks.co/). also cs kids use the labs pls they have 4k monitors, nice ass chairs, remote desktop, snack bar (not free but cheaper than the rest of campus) and free printing (unfortunately it costs money on the rest of campus).
11. **research:** find a field you're interested and find the contact info of faculty members and ask for research positions in their labs or w grad students they know. the earlier you do this the better but you might struggle to find a position early on, just keep trying.
12. **student jobs:** you can do work study and you'll get extra money every quarter (you can work up to the amount that's included in your award letter under the work study section), an example is working in local pointe. there's also jobs that are on campus but aren't work study, they're limited to uw students and its separate from work study so you don't need to have that offer in your aid letter to apply, an example is the allen school ambassador position.
13. **college tax credits**: american opportunity tax credit, can get extra money from the gov for two separate years during college (as long as you're full time), worth filing your taxes even if you don't have a job for this reason.
14. **internships\*:** find a list of freshman internships/opportunities on reddit and apply to all of them, they're specially designed for people just starting college so you have a higher chance of getting in + you'll meet dope ass people. check out microsoft new tech especially i did that and it was a great experience.
15. **financial aid:** you can get enough financial aid/scholarships/grants that uw pays you every quarter for your expenses, i started off with receiving $2k every quarter and got all the way to $6k/quarter. there’s a cap on this (i think 8k for in-state but i could be wrong), so apply to every scholarship that you can. apply to emergency aid when you’re in financial need: [washington.edu/emergencyaid](http://washington.edu/emergencyaid) (will open when quarter starts, can usually apply a couple times a quarter).
16. **finances + investing:** once you start making money start making your money work for you, forget about spending it. move all your money to an fdic-insured high interest savings account (bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/). or spend it on niches/things that will retain value. i wasted a lot of it on video games and other things that didn’t hold their value. if you play your cards right you could easily have 50k+ before you even graduate (i didn’t have loans). more financial advice at the bottom of the post if you’re interested. if you're interested in **options trading** check this video out: [**youtube.com/watch?v=sd7sw0bf1ms&t=1588s**](http://youtube.com/watch?v=sd7sw0bf1ms&t=1588s)
17. **license + car:** get a license even if you're not planning to get a car, it'll drop your insurance rates by hundreds when you got that 🔥 internship money to get one. use zipcar to get around seattle, theres a discount for students so you don’t even need to get your own car.
18. **uw student discounts:** here’s a website that lists all the discounts uw students receive: [thewholeu.uw.edu/tag/discounts/](http://thewholeu.uw.edu/tag/discounts/). you can go to the zoo for cheap and visit some of the museums around seattle on a discount.
19. **textbooks:** you don’t necessarily have to pay for textbooks (especially in your later classes), you can find plenty of links online just search reddit. some classes unfortunately tie their participation grade to online versions of the textbook so just take the l on those.
20. **scholarships:** you can get scholarships for study abroad so you can basically go for free, checkout the gilman scholarship, also the allen school has a lot of scholarships (some departments offer scholarships for in-major students, usually starts your second year as the application period is during the summer).
21. **and most importantly, for everyone but especially the bros**: up your fashion/general glow game i see too many damn people rocking sweats and tech t-shirts for all 4/5 years they’re at uw. go to h&m or pacsun or literally any decent place at the mall, get a beard by using minoxidil (i went from baby face to full facial hair) or learn to trim it pls get a philips norelco ($50), use teeth whitening strips, go to the dentist, (**girls** wash your hair yes we can see the oil + fix your **anterior pelvic tilt** (google)), look up videos on fixing your posture, use chapstick, pls use deodorant, find fashion yters, cut your damn nails, get basic skin treatment products, go to the barber at least every other month, get your eyebrows done, get a tongue brush, use floss, get separate body wash and shampoo (i’m looking at you irish spring 5000 in 1), get a korean body scrubber or loofah (you’re welcome, no your hands are not enough it helps w body acne), get a nice perfume/cologne at sephora, use moisturizer. i found all this info cuz i was sick of lookin like a scrub, looks aren’t everything ofc but these are the basics and they’ll help get your confidence up.

bonus: apply to this [**foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/undergraduate-entrepreneurship/lavin-entrepreneurship-program**](http://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/undergraduate-entrepreneurship/lavin-entrepreneurship-program), which is now open and closes october 24th, its a program that lets you meet ceos around the seattle area and meet a bunch of amazing people, also consider doing the entrepreneurship minor they give you money to make your own company.

this isn’t a definitive guide but it should help you navigate uw and set you up for success. also don't drink too much alcohol it makes you sluggish and will decrease your physical wellbeing (i notice even one glass in the gym the next day) but remember to have fun every once in a while (finding a balance is key tbh you're prob gon struggle for your first few years w this).

as recently as last quarter i was an allen school ambassador so i’d be down to schedule some relaxed office hours to answer any questions y’all have. thanks and good luck y’all! dm me here or on ig if you have more questions: [instagram.com/geov.cas](http://instagram.com/geov.cas).

edit: more bonus stuff, if you gotta gaming pc use it to mine ethereum, or better yet look into crypto lending exchanges, you basically lend whatever crypto you own and earn interest off it. look into registering an llc and you can start your business credit score if you're ever thinking of opening up one in the future.

edit 2: for those interested, here’s the approach i took to financials. what i’d recommend is: 

1. i transferred all of my money from becu (0.5% interest rate up to $500) to varo bank (this gave me a rate of 1.5% up to 10k, which was considered high during the pandemic, there’s probably better ones out there now) 
2. learn about stocks and options in general ofc but especially learn the greeks (youtu.be/sd7sw0bf1ms) 
3. learn technical analysis (youtu.be/eynxyokgpng)
4. develop a trading strategy (mainly for long term stocks)
5. get some graphing software (i recommend trading view)
6. stocks: place 80% of your whatever amount you’re comfortable investing into long term stocks
7. options: once you’ve learned your stuff place 20% in options. i chose to implement a 20% gain target and a -20% stop loss (tune to your risk level)
8. remember time in the market beats timing the market after all. at the end of the day i know jack shit compared to big investors but this is what i’ve been able to learn during the pandemic, educate yourself and hopefully the concept at least piques your interest!",advice

"[u-pass] remember to tap on and tap off on light rail for some students who use the light rail in wa for the first time, please remember to tap on before you board the train, and tap off after you leave the train.

if you fail to tap on before you board the train, when a fare enforcement officer comes around to check that you paid your fare,  **you might run the risk of a $124 citation.**

# if you’re transferring to a bus or another train? 

# should you still tap off? 

**yes!** if you get off a link train without tapping your u-pass, when you tap your u-pass to get on another train, the reader will actually register that as a tap off. if a fare enforcement officer checks your card now, it will show that you haven’t tapped on for your second train. there’s that citation risk **of $124** again.

here is what you should do:

1. tap on before boarding any transit vehicle using your u-pass.
2. if you’re riding on link light rail or a sounder train, tap off at the end of your ride.
3. if you’re transferring, just follow those steps again on the next leg of your trip. that orca technology inside your husky card will be able to tell that you’re transferring. it’s that smart!

another reason for tapping on and tapping off your husky card is to **keep the cost down** for everyone. if you fail to tap off and are charged for a more expensive trip than the one you took, the u-pass program has to pay the difference.

for example, if a u-pass member takes a ride downtown from uw station to do some shopping, the cost of the trip should be about $2.50. but if the u-pass member doesn’t tap off, the program is charged about $3.25.

"am i screwed? tl;dr: how much do i have to pay to cancel my 12-month apartment agreement right now?

i had first signed up for the 9-month dorms, then i was waitlisted so i switched to 12-month apartments, for which i was waitlisted again. i had absolutely no experience with hfs or any college housing (i was freshman last year when everything was online), so this made me pretty anxious the whole process was a hassle to get through.

i ended up finding off-campus housing and signed a 12-month contract for it and moved in last week.

after that, i sent an email to hfs asking to cancel my application, foolishly thinking that they would adjust my account to cancel it without fees like they did when i emailed them regarding my 9-month application. i was afraid to cancel it manually on the hfs home page because i thought they were going to charge me the cancellation fees if i just did it myself. i only recently realized that the reason they asked for my student information in the email interaction was not because they used it to adjust my account, but solely to look at my waiting list status and tell me what i already knew. 

the next part’s on me - i didn’t really check my emails for the past week because i was busy figuring out living in my off-campus apartment and such, and today i checked for the first time in a week just to realize i was apparently assigned a room despite them telling me they didn’t expect to assign me until late autumn quarter, and i’d have to pay full cancellation charges if i wanted to cancel it. 

my question here is what they mean by “$500 + full housing agreement charges.” again, i’m totally inexperienced with hfs, and i sincerely hope this is just a stupid newbie question, but does this mean they want me to pay them the whole ~$5000 that i’d pay if i was using the apartment for the whole year?",advice

that doesn't make sense to me, because the main point of physical contact between my things and the cafeteria things is my hand, not my bottle/cup. i also don't like wasting materials, even though (as the staff pointed out), they're compostable. compostable containers still take resources to make, transport, and actually compost, and i don't see the need to use more than necessary in this case.

"how do u get friend at uw? i saw posts about two people wanting their bf or gf by trying post on here, but i noticed no one asked how to make friend. 

i mean, i'm slowly recovering from covid quarantine aftermath by trying to be more outgoing and talking to people but i noticed that the friendship doesn't last these days which happens all the time. 

but the fear is still there; i mean after all, i'm transferred senior but i have no experiences of being on campus for longer than a month before this term so i know absolutely no one so far. and really i feel like i got nothing out of this university because of how much opportunity i have lost to network with people. i'm sure most of you feels the same. 

and plus the fact that i'm little older than an average student here doesn't help; most of people immediately dropped me after telling them that i'm turning 26 this year. that literally made me devastated for few days thinking that i literally can't make friend here. everyone is smarter than me and young, and people i encountered were people who wants to talk to people around their age. 

i don't know where to even start. thinking about these just makes me feel pathetic. i know i shouldn't complain, but i ran out of idea. i tried talking to classmate, posting things here, going to club, and overall tried my hardest to engage with them but it wasn't any useful. at this point it feels like i'm thrown in a cell except i can freely go home.

"screwed up schedule hi y'all,

i'm suppose to graduate this spring and i only have 5 class left to take, not including this quarter.   
my problem is, i was planning on taking these two classes at the same time next quarter (class a and class b). but, i just learned that class a is actually a prereq for class b.   


i'm currently freaking out because i was not aware of this, nor did my advisors let me know despite me going to them for academic help. i do not want to wait a whole year to graduate just to take one class. if i were to take class a next quarter and then class b, i'll end up being a whole quarter behind because class b is a series class that requires me to take one more class after it (class c).   


i already emailed my advisors about this situation but do yall think i'll be able to still take both classes at the same time? class b has three class prereqs that i needed to take, two of which i already took and did above a 3.0 on. class a is the third class in a series and which i did very well on in the first two quarters.",academics

"it's that time again; guys if you're going to approach a girl in public, here's how to do it we're back on campus and haven't talked to people on campus in over a year. it's weird and we're all socially (and probably touch) deprived. if you want to make friends or find a potential partner, chances are you've considered the cold-approach of just walking up to a cute stranger and asking them out.

for reasons you may never fully understand, this can be scary for women. always has been, always will. as a woman who's had this happen a not-insignificant number of times, it really depends on the situation. sometimes it's straight-up predatory, and even if you aren't a creep, we still have to be prepared for that. we get that some people are really trying to be nice, but it's awkward because of the timing/location/lack of social skills so here's some advice:

the best of intentions can still make moments like this plenty upsetting! pick your time/place carefully-- if she's near the front of a 30 min line at the suzzalo starbucks, she's not going to be able to leave if she feels uncomfortable. also 9am is a little early to get hit on, at least let her finish her coffee.

don't open with a comment on physical appearance (unless it's to compliment a specific piece of clothing or pin or something you have in common). we already know that's what got your attention. you can work in a compliment whilst flirting, but don't start there-- there are plenty of things more interesting about her than her physical appearance, and she'll be very impressed if you manage to convey that in the first 20 seconds. instead, start with a greeting that gives her a chance to answer how she's doing and importantly, if this is a good time to talk (you're not more important than cramming for a midterm, so if that's what's happening at the library then don't drag it out). if you get a conversation going, offer small bits of information like what/where your housing is or what your year/major is-- just things that turn you into a real person in her head instead of a random stranger from who-knows-where). keep this convo brief-- even if she seems interested, a) she's probably also still in the middle of something, and b) you don't want to play your whole hand at once-- leave her wondering more about you. the more you talk the more likely it is she'll hear something that kills her interest. if your goal is a date, wait til then before you start diving into how compatible you might be.

now for your exit strategy-- this is the most important part. even if it's going well, if it's not a good time or she seems uncomfortable here's what you should say/do: ""anyways, i'm \[insert name here\], i should probably get going but i'd really like to get to know you better. can i give you my number/snapchat?"" (if you managed to find a common hobby, invite her to participate in said hobby with you). and then here's the kicker- do not give her your phone or ask for hers. give your number/snap to her on a piece of paper, old-fashioned style (but write it out in front of her so it doesn't look like you've been handing out business cards to every other girl). you don't really have to wait for an answer, just hand it to her/leave it on the table, and make a swift exit (throw in a ""have a nice day"" or even a ""talk to you later!"" if you're feeling bold).

it may catch her off guard, but in a good way-- it'll make you stand out and seem classier, more like the male lead of her fave 2000s rom com and less like someone who just hits on girls as a hobby and collects numbers like pokemon cards. this also gives her the chance to decide if she's interested without the fear of someone she doesn't know having her contact information, or having someone hover over her to make that decision on the spot. less of a chance of a knee-jerk ""no"" reaction. if she's interested, she'll reach out. if not, drop it. you don't want to chase after someone who isn't interested in you anyways.

a few final notes on flirting/the conversation itself:  
\- confidence is by far the most important thing-- if you seem nervous, she's gonna think you're swinging out of your league and she shouldn't settle (related-- don't swing out of your league; aka don't pick the hottest person you see, pick someone who might pick you too)

\- smile and try to get her to smile; you don't have to be funny but be nice

\- plan what you're going to ask her before you approach, but don't try to memorize a script-- find something specific about her to ask about, it's much easier for her to talk about herself than follow a random topic of conversation

\- again, keep it brief. the longer you interrupt her day, the greater the chance of annoying her to saying no for reasons unrelated to your charms

finally, this is not the ideal way to meet someone-- you should really use this as a last resort if you don't have any opportunities to meet people in your classes or at a club meeting or through friends

y'all are gonna shoot your shot anyways though so hopefully this'll save everyone involved from a very awkward encounter. good luck gents",advice

"i've seen some posts looking for friends on this subreddit, and i'd like to start a friend application thread👌 i've been trying some rso's and interact with classmates and even tried to interact people from online, but for some reason everyone left and it didn't motivate me to try for making friend. i tried everything for it to work including being understanding, be nice etc,  but sometimes there are times that none of them works. 

i've been pretty hesitant to upload anything regarding to friendship thread on this subreddit because it's usually used for academic specific, or just people trying to gather for specific purpose. but seeing and knowing that everyone is also seeking for some sort of connection here made me relieved and know that i'm not alone here. 

so i'd decided to be little different (although it's not original idea) and creative about making connection; making this post to be a self introduction thread where you comment your brief introduction about yourself on this thread and reply to people that you are interested in being friend with. and if you got replies from people on your intro, you could possibly take your discussion in dm 👌

i'd start off myself for the intro:

my name is jae, who is transferred senior and going to turn 26 next month. currently in communication major, and pursuing entrepreneurship minor. i like that i'm easy going, understanding and try to be considerate. i'm little shy and can be awkward time to time but i like to think myself that i'm fun person to be around. i laugh a lot so maybe some of my happy energy might pass onto u 😀
i also play drums and spend quite a bit of time listening to music. if you are ever interested talking about musics or video games, let's vibe 👌 feel free to pm me if you are interested 👀


and of course you don't have to leave an intro if you don't want to! just thought this would be a fun way of making connections 👉👈",student life

"ultimate guide to uw seattle campus (registration, buildings) as the registration for winter 2022 begins, you will take another batch of classes at different locations. however, college campus is huge compared to high school campus. here's my ultimate guide on how to not get lost on uw campus. i divide the uw seattle campus into six regions: up north, montlake east, red square, fountain, waterfront southwest, and far south.  


**the up north region (6)**

* ***buildings***: *parrington hall (par), denny hall (den), paccar hall (pcar), dempsey hall (dem), hutchinson hall (hut), and bank of america executive education center (exed)*.
* ***tips***: buildings at the up north region are typically on the top of the hill, which you need to walk or run uphill from anywhere on the campus. except for parrington hall, all the buildings are next to each other. i recommend you walk fast, not run, when going uphill so you can save more energy before class starts.

**the montlake east region (8)**

* ***buildings***: *loew hall (low), mechanical engineering building (meb), mueller hall (mue), more hall (mor), bill & melinda gates cse center (cse2), thomson hall (tho), clark hall (clk), and communications building (cmu)*.
* ***tips***: mostly downhill, except for the segment of east stevens way from mueller hall to loew hall. those building are the closest to the ima fields and building but far away from the ave. some recitation sections or seminar-style classes are held at either loew hall, mechanical engineering building, or thomson hall. if you do not want to walk uphill, then take bus route 372 or 75 and get off by padelford hall. not recommend using the burke-gilman trail, you will climb lots of stairs (unless you like it).

**the red square region (9)**

* ***buildings***: *kane hall (kne), savery hall (sav), gowen hall (gwn), smith hall (smi), miller hall (mlr), raitt hall (rai), music building (mus), art building (art), and meany hall (mny)*.
* ***tips***: since these buildings are clustered around the red square, so there will be lots of people walking around from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. when walking at the red square region, please walk gently while speedy, and don't push or mess up the crowds. bricks at the red square can be slippery at times, be cautious. also, from kane hall to art building is a hill.

**the fountain region (10)**

* ***buildings***: *mary gates hall (mgh), sieg hall (sig), johnson hall (jhn), bagley hall (bag), guggenheim hall (gug), electrical and computer engineering building (ece), chemistry library building (chl), nano science building (nan), atmospheric science-geophysics building (atg), benson hall (bns) and chemistry building (chb).* 
* ***tips***: hill climbings at johnson-mary gates hall walkway and rainier vista. if you're going from ece building to miller hall, you need to speed walk. walking fast at an uphill slope is easier than downhill. mary gates hall has multiple exits on the first floor. walking towards the hub-sieg area and making turns to avoid the crowds. for those classes at either bns, chl, atg, or bag, take the west stevens way to the red square or west campus dorms and buildings.

**the waterfront southwest region (11)**

* ***buildings***: *marine studies building (mar), fishery science building (fsh), fisheries teaching building (ftr),  hitchcock hall (hck), physics/astronomy auditorium (paa), physics/astronomy building (pab), kincaid hall (kin), condon hall (cdh), gould hall (gld), architecture hall (arc), and social work building (sws)*.
* ***tips***: they're far away, and i do not recommend having another class at those buildings back-to-back (paa and pab are not terrible in term of the distance). if you have to take it here, then you could either speed walk, jog, or come late to the class (not recommended), especially for the fishery science building. hitchcock hall is located next to life science building and kincaid hall, the second overpass bridge from the west. for condon hall, take the 41st street to avoid traffic lights. for gould hall, jaywalk campus parkway and take the overpass. 

**the far south region (6)**

* ***buildings***: *bloedel hall (bld), anderson hall (and), wickenwerder forest lab (wfs), health science tower (hst), health science building (hsb), and roberts hall (rob)*.
* ***tips***: far away. walk fast or jog.",student life

individual study spaces?? i’ve been trying to find rooms in different buildings where i can study independently without any distractions. i have social anxiety so it’s difficult for me to study in areas like odegaard because i end up walking around for hours trying to find a secluded area. i’ve found the ecc to be pretty helpful however it’s more of an open area rather than a room. if you guys know any areas that aren’t super populated it would help me a lot.,student life
"how cutthroat are stem majors at uw? i'm currently a first-year thinking about majoring in bioengineering, however i was not admitted directly into the college of engineering. am i shit out of luck for getting bioe then? should i torture myself by taking extremely hard courses in pursuit of this major, or should i aim for a different one? also considering acms, biochem, and public health.

i haven't had stellar performance in my weed-out classes so far (out of math 125, 126, and chem 142 my highest grade was a 3.6). however, i've done well in all my other classes and i'm about to publish my first research paper.

do you guys feel like you're here because you want to be, or because you're obligated to be?

i'm just curious if anyone else is feeling just... dissatisfied, really. like this is really pointless or not doing anything for you. why is that? what are your solutions and thoughts? transfer to another school, transfer out of school into a trade or apprenticeship, just taking a couple years off to work and find yourself... whaddaya think? and if you used to feel that way but have found inspiration, what is it that drives you to succeed here?",advice

however, we also have in-person exams which you are required to attend. the professor doesn’t offer make up exams (one exam is dropped from the final grade) so there is a lot of pressure to go even if you are sick. lots of people coughing, sneezing, etc, in a lecture hall where there isn’t space to socially distance.

this is mildly frustrating normally but you can kind of work with it, just lay low for a few days after the exam and get a covid test. however the next exam is the day before thanksgiving. many students are concerned about contracting covid during the exam and then exposing their families when they go home. is there anything we can do other than just take the l and not show up to the exam?",advice

now not every school is open for the public, and even if it were, i wouldn’t know what’s special about the school. as of now, i’ve only done the business school, since it’s where i study.

\*

after lots of research, i have found that if you want to be a uw cs major as a running start student it is most important that you get the cs major [prerequisites](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/currentuw) finished ([with nearly perfect grades](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/transfer)) so you can enroll for direct admission into the cs major as a freshman because as of 2019 the cs major became a [predominantly direct admission major](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm). you should only go for an associate's degree if you have enough leftover classes after finishing the prerequisites for the cs major with high grades. an associate's degree is good for your resume and working before you get your bachelor's. i don't think most people will work at more than minimum wage jobs until after completing their major anyways, making the associate's degree seem nearly pointless for uw cs majors. after completing the prerequisites it is important to get as many [cs major graduation requirements](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/ugrad/curriculum/cs_reqs_wi22.pdf) as your community college offers as possible to finish the required courses at an easier and cheaper college.

from the title it probably seems like i’m insecure about my grades and feeling like i’m behind everyone academically, but i’m actually pretty confident in my intellect. what i am insecure about it the way i dress. lemme explain . . .

ok so i’m a cs major and we all know the stereotypes about cs majors being lazy and dressing in gross t-shirt and jeans. now that’s partially true, but not everyone dresses that way. i, for one, like to dress up whether that’s at school or outside. but for some reason i feel like as a woman in stem i’m judged for it.

a few weeks ago i dressed up a little more than usual. nothing crazy i just put in more effort in my makeup and outfit. i felt so good and was so happy that day until i walked into my cs lecture. a group of guys were looking at me in a way that seemed super judgmental. out of the 120 people in that room i heard at least 25 ish people scoff and stare at my outfit. that doesn’t seem like much but it made me nervous. some of them were girls too which just made me sad. i had a pretty bad panic attack and went home early. that day i went straight home and came back the next day in a plain sweatshirt and jeans.

here’s my dilemma: my mom surprised me with a beautiful and i mean beautiful tote bag that i’ve been wanting for some time. problem is it looks pretty “grown up” and “dressed up”. i feel like people will just make fun of me again and i’m scared to wear it. my mom was so happy to give it to me though it makes me so sad that i’m hesitating to wear it.

why are people just so mean sometimes?

i guess i just want some advice on how to stop caring what other people think about the way i dress. easier said than done, huh?",student life

so i'll start off by saying that i thought this quarter being in-person would help me adjust to a more consistent sleep/wake routine because i'd have to actually come to classes instead of rolling out of bed and slumping into my desk (ahhh, how i miss online year now...)

needless to say this quarter hasn't really made things better for my sleeping habits, and i know a lot of folks are also struggling with maintaining a normal schedule. to anyone reading this at 2 am, i feel your pain.

has anyone got any suggestions for how to go to sleep and wake up at a better time?

i'll start off with a few ideas that i thought of but can't really get rolling yet:
1. have an enjoyable part to your morning routine like watching a short youtube video while sipping your cup of coffee
2. cut off or reschedule late-night habits which includes screens
3. reduce screen time in the evening in general
4. make a habit of brushing your teeth, showering, etc. significantly earlier than you go to bed so you feel like you can just slump in at any time
5. read a (paper) book for 20 minutes or so half an hour before your ideal bed time

anyone have any other suggestions? i'm stumped",advice

"how much of a “college experience” can be had living near campus i despise commuting. i commuted this year for financial reasons and wish i didn’t have to. i never have time to finish homework. my only social interaction with uw students was through instagram pages or study groups, and even then, i would leave campus with most of my work unfinished and come home too tired to finish it. i have no time to attend club meetings either. i want to live on or near campus but i am debating whether to dorm or live in a studio. i don’t know anyone who is looking for a roommate for one thing. for another i want to have some semblence of a traditional college experience. i was “homeschooled” from k-12 at a hybrid parent/school system teaching resource center, and never got to develop socially as i would have in a normal school, as it was next to impossible to be anywhere without your parent or someone elses breathing down your back. most people there were neurodivergent (i am as well, but an environment of 100% nds is… something) or religiously fanatic, and that didn’t help things. i made the mistake of doing running start. i spent three years only to come out with 60 relevant credits, no breathing room for electives to fill the gaps between courses at uw, a social environment worse than high school, and crippled mental health. (i never saw my mental health improve faster than the period immediately after i left community college) i am technically a junior but in standing i am a sophomore. i desperately want to meet people, attend a few parties, and feel like i am part of my university community. at the same time i recognize that hfs provides pretty piss poor value for money, and that a studio would be substantially cheaper than living on campus. there are plenty of options near uw, and it would allow me to stay on campus to work longer, and attend club meetings. it would give me much more privacy and comfort as well.

"a tool to authenticate your class discord! i've just graduated a few weeks ago. however i created an open sourced tool during my independent study for a professor's class discord.

as uw starts the first week via online, i believe that this may be helpful for students who are creating their online class discord communities. this tool authenticates students using their uwnetid. upon authenticating, they will be given a predefined role in the class discord. the role may be used to grant additional access to the server. this is so that that only students and/or other uw affiliated people with a uwnetid may access their class discords. there is an optional logging mechanic which may also be used so that the one who created the server may know which student is whom in the server for additional security.

[demo: the process to authenticate into the server](https://preview.redd.it/y40s5sbau5981.png?width=2102&format=png&auto=webp&s=84dbdec42a9fdda3581678731ef1674bf7401240)

here's the github repo that students may clone and host independently on the uw web publishing server (vergil/ovid/etc). [**https://github.com/endendragon/uw-discord-auth**](https://github.com/endendragon/uw-discord-auth)

for those who are familiar with uw web publishing process, the setup is easy, straight-forward, and are written within the readme.md file of this repository. however i am also able to accept dms on discord if anyone would like to contact be for more questions or info regarding to this project. you may find me on uw discord, endendragon#1337.",academics

"subsidized loan help hi yall i took out a subsidized loan for the school year though i’ve been working, so i have enough to pay the loans back. however, then i’d be pretty short on pocket money for emergencies and stuff. my understanding is that i don’t have to pay interest on these loans until 6 months or so after graduation. 

does that mean they are technically “harmless” so long as they are paid before then? does accepting the subsidized loans and paying them off before the gov-paid interest expires cost me any more than not taking the loans out at all?

my objective is to not have to pay anything extra in the long run, but accept the loans if i can to have more financial breathing space. if the loans will cost me more even if they’re paid off before the graduation grace period ends, i’d rather just pay them now and live frugally each quarter.

"[advice needed] transferring to electrical engineering to computer engineering? hello, need advice :d

i was a direct admit to engrud but was placed into ece (i know it can be used, etc etc but i'm far more passionate about the content covered in cmpe). 

i know people work super hard and get rejected so i am sure it is pretty hopeless but thought i might ask for a second opinion if i choose to reapply:

* gpa: my gpa was tanked with covid and especially phys 12x and family situations - it was absolutely brutal. my gpa is a 3.1 at the moment. >\_<
* cs courses: 
   * i have taken cse 142, 143 (while the grades aren't super high, they are higher than all my other grades by far except vlpa, div, w)
   * cse 190: lab that went with cse 142 and helped with fundamentals
   * cse 390h: i was one of 18 students to take an honors cs course with professor reges where he talked about how cs people approach problems, common issues, etc.
   * cse 331: i was lucky and secured a spot today in this course (i really wanted it and worked super hard to get into it with my petition, emails, etc)
   * cse 373: also taking this course this quarter with kevin lin - so far, i really enjoy the content.
* research
   * i am currently a member in a research lab of 100+ people and have quickly became a high ranking technical writer with grant proposals being funded for the lab.
   * i am also the finalist in two competitions for a project i'm working on (i am working with 1 other but i am definitely pulling my own weight for the competitions). it is quick possible this project is becoming a startup within the next month, in which case i will be a startup leader? that's wild.
* extracurriculars
   * i am currently the director of a hackathon that is later this year and leading committees, securing sponsors, obtained mlh status, etc. i have spearheaded this.
   * i am an ece ta where i work with assignments, exams, course materials, etc.
   * i have continuously worked since sophomore year in high school and have worked at a grocery store since the start of covid for 20hrs a week
* internship
   * i am desperately trying to get one and just got the book cracking the coding interview to assist with interviews
* family
   * i have a disabled sibling that i also help my family care for 3 days a week. :)
* high school stuff
   * fbla president and 4 statewide awards and national finalist
   * asb treasurer, link crew, nhs, tri-m honor society
   * 3.7 gpa and then 4.42 gpa weighted
   * 12 ap courses with scholarship with distinction twice, even during covid senior year
   * orchestra
   * a killer personal statement

i have very strong writing skills so i am sure my personal statement would be as good as possible - but i do not feel my application is enough (will it ever be?) i only discovered my passion for cs when i got to uw and i am so annoyed - i feel i was a stronger applicant back before covid, when i applied to uw (but regrets dont help) 

if there is no chance for uw cs or cmpe, i am strongly considering switching to uwb csse which has coursework that aligns with things i very much would enjoy ...

"re: what keeps you going? i made effort in typing my long af response, but then op deleted their post. :< 

hence this post now exists. y'all can drop your tips and aspirations and whatever else below too! maybe some of you guys can end up being friends in the comments and whatnot--that would be neat. anyways, how have y'all been? i haven't posted here since graduating so uh... ye!

**tl;dr: self-reflection, addressing stressors within my control, making things easier for future me (and then thanking past me), reducing screen time, making my bed, and trying to get to bed at a reasonable time.**

senior year was really rough for me... aside from general stress of being sleep deprived and attempting to barely manage my courseload, i had a pretty awful break up; the place i worked at was closed down thanks to uw's upper management; the restaurant i started working at afterwards closed down after three months thanks to covid; and lastly, i had the honor of being part of the 1st graduating covid class with all the profs scrambling and having no idea how to really teach online or handle our senior projects that was basically required to be in-person to have any sort of value... xd

honestly, not much kept me going and i basically hit rock bottom. i really wanted to drop out multiple times during senior year, but knowing all the physical/mental/financial sacrifices i (and my parents) made for the sake of my education stopped me from doing so even though each day felt like hell (and i did heavily debate on yeeting myself... still a work in progress...shhh).

anyhow, there's no need to pretend to be okay. in fact, it's totally fine and normal to not be okay, especially given current circumstances going on in our world. your feelings are very valid. personally, what's been keeping me going is uhhh... bruh, idek--most of the time, i'm just barely scraping by. i guess i have a lofty goal of retiring early (~35-40 y/o) one day to figure out what i actually wanna do with my life because i still got no idea... perhaps i'll write/illustrate some children's books or maybe open a cozy bookstore/cafe/bar/makerspace or volunteer at a library or plant nursery or maybe do all of them?! the possibilities are endless if you got time (and access to money/resources depending on what you wanna do).

as for how i've been coping, i been trying to reduce screen time outside my job, spend more time doing arts & crafts, check in with myself through journaling/self-reflection, take walks in nature when possible, and make a point to make my bed each day before i sleep (so future me will appreciate it)! i been also getting into plant propagation and seeing plants in my vicinity indoors has been making me feel a bit better overall. :)

when things get too overwhelming, i'll write down everything that's been stressing me out, whether it's in or out of my control--and if it is within my control, what i can do about it now and make a plan as to how to go about to tackling it. now, the hard part is generally executing it and i got nothing for you on that aside from developing your self-discipline, making the task look less daunting by divvying it up to even smaller parts (e.g. write an essay = turn on laptop, login to account, read the essay prompt in full, research topic & gather relevant resources, write outline, write first paragraph, etc.), or just forcing yourself to do it for a minimum of 15 minutes (usually starting is harder that actually doing it imo)... the easier you make it for future you, the more likely you'll do it. :')

anyways, i believe in ya op (and the rest y'all too)!! just a few more months and the weather should be less gloomy and all of you will have either graduated or gotten through another year!! :d

p.s. maybe also take some vitamin d supplements cause how little sunlight we get in the winter months. :')",advice

"why there are no resubmissions in cse 143 (hunter schafer)? i am not sure why they are not offering resubmissions and simulated exams this quarter. because in the previous quarter's (hunter schafer, au 21) course website says that the course had resubmissions and not-real exams. 

also, i took cse 142 the previous quarter, and it had resubmissions and simulated exams. because of those two factors, i succeeded in this course.

if this quarter does not have resubmissions and simulated exams but previous quarters did, isn't it unfair that students who studied quarters with resubmissions have a higher chance to get the desired grade than the students who studied quarters without resubmissions and simulated exams? moreover, when it comes to admission to cs major or any other major, they will only consider grades, not professors taught in that particular quarter.

in addition, the ""additional offering of cse143 available"" email, specifically says that this course (with hunter schafer) will run independently of the current course (with stuart reges). but in reality, they both have the same grading system, no resubmission policy, and in-person exams.

some other options i thought of was s/ns the class because this quarter is an extraordinary quarter. i am luckily already in my major and interested in going to med school. i was doing some research and for at least during covid, many medical schools accept pass/fail credit for prerequisite. 

the last option was to drop the class now and take it another quarter. the problem is that i have to be a full-time student to receive aid and if i drop biol 200, i won't be able to have a lot of my tuition covered. i am currently receiving full aid this quarter.

reading through this (and my history of my time at the uw for the last three years) had made me uncomfortable and slightly confused. there are some comments that i feel included too much personal information from my life, and at least two that are untruthful. so, in essence, i am debating about reaching out to the advisors and asking them to correct them.

however, i am wondering if that is even really needed? i am graduating in two quarters, and i think i am correct in believing that my uw record won’t be updated or relevant when i graduate?

"has anyone ever been “reported” to the communications chair? what usually comes of that? a summary of what happened that lead to it:

every week we have about 3 readings and 4 assignments every week. this week, in addition to those assignments and readings we also had a paper due. two days before the paper was due i sent him an email and asked him about if in next class we could have a group discussion and see about possibly not having to do one of those assignments only the next week that we have a paper due, since this week was a bit overwhelming and i was wondering if it was the same for other students or if it was just me. (the initial email i sent him was super chill, and reading it you could tell it was just a student who was stressed out).

when he responded, his first sentence was “i’m not sure what you’re trying to convey in this email but,” then listed out 1-5 (like a literal list) how this is the collage life and i need to get used to it, i should have said something when the assignment was given, i’ve had the syllabus so i should have planned ahead, etc. etc. and i’m summing it up so more went into it, but the way he worded things, he was clearly talking down to me and i felt like i was being belittled.
so i replied (angerly, i’ll admit) about how i didn’t see why he needed to talk down to me, i was just asking about a possibility, and i have other classes with other assignments and i simply wasn’t able to plan how overwhelmed i’d be, i thought i could handle it. i have only a quarter left in my senior year you know?

bottom line, he didn’t like my response and said his “writing style and how he choose to convey things is his choice” and he will not let me talk about this situation next class (i said i wanted to get other students feelings about the assignments) and that he reported me to “the chair of communication and academic advisor”

so i’m just wondering.. does anyone know what’ll happen?

edit: i also want to add after he told me he reported me, he said “good luck on your paper” and i’m kind of worried to submit things to him now and that this issue is going to affect my grade. so i haven’t turned it in yet (he actually extended the due date to tonight because 2 other students asked)",advice
"abt the crime in the area i’m originally from a city with high rates of murders and whatnot. talking like once i was walking down the street, there were firefighters taking down an arson fire in one building and cops dealing with a hostage situation in the building next door. i’ve been shot at a couple times too. so i think i have good advice. 

so, here’s my advice to avoid these crimes happening in the area. 

if you go anywhere, go with three or more people. don’t go out alone after sunset. 

because the weapon being used is a taser, you can run. don’t even try to fight, throw your valuable items onto the ground and just run. 

a lot of people believe these are human traffickers. most traffickers just lure young people in and manipulate them over a long period of time. these are robbers, they don’t want your body, they want your stuff. 

if these people talk to you, speak in a slow clear voice and say exactly what you’re going to do in every motion, “i am going to hand you my cell phone/keys/whatever.” you absolutely do not want them to think you are a threat, as they will just attack you. 

if you are restrained or fear they are going to move you to a second location, then you start freaking out. scream, flail, act wildly. be so inconvenient that they don’t want to mess with you. attract so much attention, they have to drop you.

last resort if you think someone is following you, start filming and confront them and tell them to stop following you. this is really a last resort. if there’s no one around to help you and you feel you can’t outrun them, this is your final call. 

if they don’t stop following you, act like a crazy, mentally insane person. like foaming, gurgling, off the rocker insanity. they will not want to be anywhere near you. 

this is my advice, i hope you guys find it helpful!",advice

i keep falling into negative feedback loops like this one. they are triggered by the most mundane of things and when they are triggered i have no way to consciously control them. i only stop spiraling through equally mundane things, like  the sunlight looking particularly nice, or having a good time with a friend.  i’m tired of pitying myself, trauma dumping on friends, and ranting on reddit. i want to see a therapist. i don’t want to on my parents insurance because a lot of the things i’ve been falling into negative feedback loops over were in part their choices, and i don‘t want to upset them. this isn’t like when i was suicidally depressed in high school where i could chock it entirely as me wanting to deal with chemical imbalance. i also am considering a career as a commercial pilot, and any mental health diagnosis has the potential to be disqualifying. are there any confidential resources i can see that are either cheap or free? i have a couple thousand dollars saved but i have no idea how many sessions that gets me",student life

"bruh y’all are rich (y’all as a generalization) 

i thought people weren’t serious when they said most students at uw could afford to live on campus. so far, almost every person i’ve met lives on campus. 

anyway, i did cashiering today at noodle, as opposed to my usual prep job, and i was shocked. 

almost every single student had $800+ dollars on their husky card. 

like, i’m assuming it’s not the exact same exchange rate as usd, it’s just husky money, but damn! the rich people at this school can afford to have anything they want, whenever! 

i’m not saying it’s bad to be rich, i’m just shocked by how different uw is from cc. like, most students don’t work and go to school. most students live on campus. most have 100s of dollars a quarter for high quality food. 

uw is a culture shock for me, in terms of wealth. anyone else relate to this?

edit:

i do know many people take out loans to live here, i was just noting how many people i have met that have been so casually wealthy that they don’t seem to process it. this post is not about scholarship loan students.  

for example, several people in my class told me how their parents pay for their entire tuition and everything else for them. again, not bad, but i just felt so surprised by how common that is here. it’s interesting to me.

double edit: 

once again, i’m directly referring to the casually wealthy students i see. the canada goose jackets, the patagonia coats, the lv wallets. 

all my food is from work or the food bank, i am a low income student observing the environment i have been placed in. if that is offensive to you, that’s fine.

on the other hand i spoke to an advisor about it and said it didn't necessarily matter, but tbh i'm really struggling dealing with such differences in opinion and it worries me.

(yeah i’m mestizo, and my dad always says my ancestors were hard-working people.)

just a realization i came to, seeing that pretty much everyone around me has internalized this mindset and i felt it’s time i shook off my sheltered complacency and adopt it as well.

i've struggled with the feeling of loneliness myself, even though i am objectively not lonely anymore (thanks to my excellent friends, love you guys, if you know who i am accept a virtual bro hug).

however, the feeling (which still hits everyone sometimes) hurts all the same, and i can sympathize with everyone who feels it most or all the time. i was there too, but it can get better.

this video by kurzgesagt is excellent at explaining the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3xv_g3g-ma

"uw ms in data science (msds): a review i have not found many places to review the uw masters in data science program on the internet, so figured it might belong here. note: msds during covid may not be what it once was or what it might be in the future.

if you majored in cse at the uw and expect the same level of quality in your masters do not apply to msds. the program has largely **not** met expectations and many of my peers feel the same way. 

teaching: boring, slow, with (sometimes) less qualified professors.  
expecting this program to be connected to cse uw i imagined some overlap between the cse professors and data classes, this was not the case. i understand that uw cse has its own masters, however many professors dont even come from uw itself, with the ones that do coming from the stats and biostats departments. many of the lectures i experienced were 4 hour slogs in which the msds discord was alight with people joking to pass the time and planning where they were going to get dinner. some even expressed that they teach themselves most topics through khan academy...   
for a major which is part stats and part computer science this program does not bring enough computer science faculty onboard, considering it is attached to the uw name.

community: vibrant, fun, interesting  
on the upside, msds has amazing cohorts, people are excited to join and network but also plan fun nights out. something that surprised me when i joined was that there were only around 5 people actually from uw in the program, with many coming from overseas or out of state. generally nothing bad to say about the students, all of them are bright and passionate.

i dont want to spend time slandering uw msds or its faculty, i wish this review only to point out the discrepancy between uw's amazing cse department and what i feel to be an underdeveloped data science program. uw msds attaches itself heavily to the uw name but the courses dont have any uw cse professors or use the same cse buildings for lectures, in reality the only connected cse event we have are the recruiting fairs, which have largely been decimated by covid. 

i hope this review becomes useless when uw decides to invest in its msds program more but i want masters students to know what they are paying for when deciding to give up 35k in tuition.

this post is being made on behalf of our uw chapter, which is in the process of forming. we have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! if you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

"question: as a running start student, should i apply as a transfer student now with the idea that i will go take some more cc classes after high school? after completely missing the freshmen application due date, i decided that going to a local community college would be fine. i was just reading up on the transfer application guidelines and it's a little confusing, particularly these couple paragraphs.

""if you are applying for the autumn quarter of the year you graduate from high school, apply as a freshman. (you are considered a freshman applicant in this circumstance; once you enroll as a student, your college credit may qualify you for sophomore or junior standing.)

if you start or continue college after leaving high school, apply as a transfer applicant using the transfer application.""

"apartments with dorm like experience i commuted and i really wish i worked more before uw to pay to live on campus my first year. i barely see my friends, and i missed out on so many of the social opportunities my friends have. i don't really feel like i am part of the university community either, mostly because i'm not even though i am on campus 8:30am-8:30pm most days. i'll be 21 next year, so i probably wouldn't fit in with dorm residents since y'all will all be 18-19. also dorm rooms are tiny for what you pay for.

are there any apartments nearby that are kind of like dorms in the way that you interact with a large amount of people living near you? realistically if i get an off campus apartment i am going to be as lonely as i am now, just lonely in the u district instead of edmonds. i've tried attending clubs but the clubs meet too infrequently to realistically lead to friendships, or are online. most people at clubs already seem to have social bubbles they don't want to break out of, and tbh at that point i don't see the point of going. making friends in classes is pretty hit or miss. i don't really get invited to anything except one on one dinner/lunch every so often which isn't really enough social stimulation for me.

i feel like i missed out on not just the ""college experience"" but the entirety of young adulthood. i was homeschooled through high school, spent 3 years in community college, and now didn't get the experience of meeting people through living on campus ",student life
"making friends & anyone looking for friends so this is kinda awkward because i've never really had any trouble making friends but it's much harder now in college because none of my friends go to uw and it's hard to talk to people when you're sitting way a part from them and can barely recognize them with masks on. but i thought i'd try something out here and maybe there are others on the same boat as me and i'd love to reach out and use this as a place to speak too. basically i'm junior standing and pol sci student, i like to listen to music, shop, fashion, movies, books, pop culture, going out to eat, pretty much everything.",student life
"i’m tired of failing but if i don’t fix this i’m throwing in the towel on life transfer student/junior/history department 

i don’t know where to start with any of this other than to say i feel hollow and like a sham.

i know i’m better than all of this but i just don’t know how i got here. i used to be so passionate and energetic. i was a mediocre high school student but really took off in speech & debate. i received good grades at my first college and did decent through the first part of the pandemic but everything changed after i left campus and then left my parent’s house to live on my own.

i lived with sociopaths, meth-heads and dying old people. i’ve slept in a nook in the wall, i’ve slept in the cold, i’ve gone to sleep hungry.

i’ve dealt with both bipolar and adhd throughout my life and while i’m now medicated, and living in a safe environment with some close friends i still can’t fucking make it work.

through most of all of this i’ve been working at a grocery store and i think it’s eating away at my soul. the crazy people, the anti-vax/anti-mask crowd, snooty and condescending upper class white people, the incompetent management and the physically-intensive labor have all been draining on me. 

but i need to pay rent and eat food (financial aid luckily covers my tuition). and those are getting more and more expensive over time it seems.

my transcript since last winter has been abysmal. a couple xs, one ns, and one whole quarter just absolutely failed (last quarter). i’ve been able to discuss a lot of my struggles and get some leeway and really appreciated assistance from advisors and counselors to be able to continue this quarter. but i just can’t seem to find the energy or patience or even mental well-being to study anymore it seems. i just lay in bed a lot of the time or just sleep because i’m so tired and depressed and i feel almost removed from my surroundings and like there’s thick barrier between me and the world right in front of me. i cry, i sleep, i stare into nothingness. it’s so tragic because i’m such a curious and fairly learned person in the subjects i study and have a yearning to go on to more, complete research and finish well but why can’t i seem to actually do any of it? it’s like i keep getting back on the horse only to fall right off.

i resent all of this because i continue to doubt myself and feel like i’m not actually equipped or intelligent enough to be here. 

i feel like an absolute failure and i think i want to just give up. not just school but i mean everything.

i write this with the second exam due for a class tomorrow when i haven’t even done the first or attended a lecture since the first day and it seems like the professor has a strict exam policy and allows no make-ups without medical or university excuse. i’m already on academic probation from my previous quarters.

i’m tired of failing and i know i’m better than this but i don’t know what to do.

i feel like my entire life is on the brink of falling apart and i just might throw myself into the lake. i’ll never reach my goals and all of this feels like a lofty escapade i was never cut out for because i’m lazy and stupid and sad.

important notes: money is not an issue. the career that i'm interested in doesn't require an internship. i've taken several internships in the past, but the ones that i'm looking into now are exactly in the career that i'm interested in. i have neither (1) offers for an internship, nor (2) a tentative summer schedule; i'm just trying to structure my expectations in the preliminary so that i can make the best decision for myself.

"clue tutors/clue tutoring center--prestige over help?? hi everyone. i've never had super negative experiences with the clue tutoring center, but this quarter has been particularly awful and there's a couple of tutors that don't know anything sadly, or they don't want to teach or care to do so. they also have a very negative way of teaching, and they assume that the student should know everything in a problem. for example, my friend asked them a simple molarity problem and one tutor couldn't even solve it, and yes she did apologize, but she claimed to not know the answer or have any notes to help, and she suggested to go to the professor. then why are we visiting the tutoring center? she also shows a lot of attitude and rolls her eyes multiple times, idk why. i went to her and asked her simple questions about naming carbonyls, and she claimed that it was too far back in her knowledge base to teach it?? i have nothing against you not knowing something, but if they don't know the simple facts, then i don't know why they are hired. i also went to one for physics calculus based, and they said that they were tired and didn't feel like teaching. he said that he had too many other students to cater to. ok, i understand that you have a job, i have one too, but can you please teach. also, whenever i ask a question, they say things like ""you seem to have a grasp on it, and i need to get to another student,"" within 12 minutes of the session, with only 2 in the waiting room. no matter how polite or curious about a topic i seem to be this happens. i don't understand the point of having a tutoring center if the students don't seem willing to teach or help out a little bit. or if there's not enough tutors. like if you don't know about the topic, the least you can do is guide the students where to go. guess i better go back to visiting the tas in long lines or watching youtube. it's so hard to get help at this university.

"re: the recent influx of “can you hold x class for me?” posts you can only sign up for, at max, 19 credits until the first day of the quarter. unless you want one, singular 4-credit or less class, no one can hold it for you (assuming they’re seeking 15 credits; if they’re seeking 12, hey, you might have a shot). however, you’d be better off just asking a close friend than looking here. additionally, you’re not always going to get the class you want - but that doesn’t mean you won’t get the ones you *need* on time. when you’re a senior you can apply for graduation up to three quarters  prior to your commencement date which gives you first priority. priority rocks - i’ve always gotten the classes i wanted. if you’re very dead set on a class, sign up for notify uw. if you’re fast enough, you’re likely to get it, even if you have to try multiple times and/or wait until the first week begins. plus, some of the classes that you guys have been asking for are major-only up until a certain date or indefinitely. if you aren’t in the major, your chances are mid-to-low of ever getting into it. if you’re in the major, you’ll get it eventually.

"looking for advice from people who have taken biol 418 or phys 323! choosing between them; how were they? hi my peeps in upper div bio and/or physics!! 

i am a junior currently registered for biol 418 (biological rhythms with de la iglesia), which sounds really interesting, but i really fell in love with phys 321/322 (electromag 1/2) and would really like to take phys 323 next quarter, which conflicts with biol 418. i have the option to drop biol 418 and take phys 323, and i'm really on the fence about if i should do it.

it makes more sense to take phys 323 right after 321/322, but i'm worried 418 won't be offered/i won't be able to get into it next spring. upper div phys registration is comparatively noncompetitive, so getting into 323 next spring is not an issue, but i'm worried i'll have forgotten too much content to learn as much. 

**for those who took biol 418:**

* how exciting was it overall as a class? like was it genuinely very interesting or did it just feel like a graduation requirement?
* was it one of those classes (or profs) that really stuck with you relative to other classes in the major (i would say 355 with buchwitz was like that)? 

**for those who took phys 323:**

* how much was your knowledge of 321/322 needed to take it? if you took 323 a year after 322, was it a significant struggle to relearn everything or was it not exclusively reliant on knowledge from 321/322? 
* do you think i could get enough out of it by just auditing, or was doing the homework crucial to appreciating the content?

"should i torture myself with 5 more credits of political science if it means i’ll graduate with a triple major? after a long journey of regretting my choice in major, i finally get to major in what i want to by taking 2 extra quarters and graduating in winter 2023. as of now, i’m pursuing a double major in philosophy and english with a minor in political science. i ended up dropping my major in political economy because i hated political science classes so much and could not stand taking another 3 courses.

now i’m finding out that i’ll only need to take 10 credits my last quarter as far as my current major requirements go, but because 10 and 15 credits cost the same amount, i was thinking of taking one extra class. something fun, something easy. something that genuinely interests me. i was thinking an art or language class. maybe even latin. 

yesterday i also found out…i only need 5 more credits to graduate with the regular political science major on top of my other two majors lmao. my mom and everyone i know is saying i should just take the last class. get a triple major because it’s one more thing on my resume and i’ve already tortured myself to this point. it’s just 5 more credits. i was just looking forward to leaving political science behind. 

anyways, just need some advice. what would you do? also, any cool political science classes, preferably political economy or political theory? i really enjoyed gill’s classes, but i’ve taken them all. i’m aware of pol s 308 as a fun theory course. if they offer it, i wouldn’t mind taking that. anything else along those lines? idk man i just cannot stand contemporary politics. i hate politics. i hate every politician. the entire discipline is not for me.

"aspiring uw student hello all,

i am a senior in washington state, and i have applied to uw.

i was about a 3.8 student pre-covid, but then i tanked to a 3.3 after covid. it’s my senior year in high school, so it’s practically impossible to raise my gpa. my sat is nowhere near where i want it to be since my school literally didn’t prep any of the students. when i applied to uw, my grade 11 marks were oh-so poor, and i can’t help but regret ever succumbing to my anxieties and depression. mental health issues are nothing new to me and they’ve never interfered with my grades, but covid really tested me. 

now, i feel like my grades have replaced my face when it comes to college applications because it seems to be grades first, and then me. there are a handful of colleges who would reach out and give me a chance of redemption when it comes to grades, but unfortunately those chances are unlikely. 

is it possible to still make a good candidate for uw, or just any college in general? 

my essays for uw have potential to makeup for the poor grades as i talked about my diverse background, mental health, and school during the pandemic. maybe that will be sufficient, but i’ll never know …!

tldr: covid tanked my grades from 3.8 to 3.3, and my only hope is that my essays are sufficient for admissions. is it possible that i’m still a good candidate for uw, let alone other colleges?

regardless of whether you get in or not, realize that a college decision does not define you in any way. you are just as smart and capable regardless of whether or not you get accepted to your dream school. 

i was in your position two years ago and i understand how stressful this time can be with the anticipation of whether or not you’ll get in mixed with potential disappointment and excitement too. it’s so many emotions at once that it can be overwhelming sometimes. take time to yourself so that you take care of your mental health. also make sure you celebrate your wins too even if you’re disappointed by some of the decisions you get. after all, making it this far is a pretty big deal and you deserve to feel proud of yourself for all of the hard work you put in.

please don’t let a less than ideal decision take away from your self worth or peace of mind. you’ll end up where you’re meant to be and you’ll get a great education regardless of where you end up going. honestly, beating yourself up about a decision just isn’t worth the time and emotional turmoil. trust me, i’m speaking from experience.

>  
>i came to the uw intending to study cs, but after two rejections i  decided to cut my losses and major in physics (an open major at the  time). i wasn't sure how much my major would hold me back, but i tried  to get as much experience as possible to make up for it. by the time i  reached my senior year, i had two internships at a no-name startup, an  on-campus webdev job, and a data science-related research assistant  position in a on-campus lab. this new grad cycle, i had \~20% callback  rate on applications. i received offers from blue origin, credit karma,  amazon and meta, and i had final interviews with several other companies  (google, stripe, akuna capital, robinhood, walmart).  
>  
>to get an offer, you need to  
>  
>1. get the interview  
>  
>2. pass the interview  
>  
>getting interviews involves a lot of luck, but there's a lot of things  you can do to increase your chances. before you have any paid dev  experience at all, get as many relevant ecs and projects on your resume  as possible. research assistant positions, ta positions, club leadership  positions, involvement in project clubs, etc will help your callback  rate when applying for your first internship. learn full stack  development and build a few simple apps/sites/games from scratch. use  best practices, document them well, host them on github pages or heroku  and put them on your resume. try to get the highest gpa you can, as many  companies still filter by this, but once you have some experience most  companies don't care about it.  
>  
>next, get as much paid development experience as you can (even a minimum  wage job at a no-name startup will significantly increase your callback  rate). competitive companies will expect new grads to have at least 1-2  internships by the time they graduate. polish your resume, apply early,  and get referrals (clubs, blind, and cs discord channels are great  sources for these). if a company you'd like to work at doesn't respond  to your online app, try cold emailing a recruiter (this is how i got a  meta interview). you'll probably need to apply to 100-200+ places to get  your first internship, but having even one internship will make future  app cycles significantly easier. having internship/projects/ecs on your  resume is especially important if you're not a cse/info major, since  they can't assume that you know anything based on your major alone.  
>  
>once you've got an interview, the only thing that matters is how well  you perform. your performance is determined by leetcode prep,  communication skills, behavioral answers, and possibly system design.  for the technical skills you need, take cse 373 (data structures and  algorithms for non-majors). cse 143/cse 373 cover most of what you need  to know for technical interviews. after taking (or self-studying) these  classes, learn the common patterns in interview questions by reviewing  grokking the coding interview. you don't need to buy the course, as much  of the material can be found for free on blogs and other sites. next,  work through the blind 75 list of leetcode questions. this covers most  of the types of questions you'll be asked in an interview, and being  able to solve these questions is enough for 90% of interviews out there.  when you have an interview coming up, complete the most common tagged  qs for that company on leetcode. some companies (like google) change up  their qs a lot so this isn't that helpful when interviewing with them,  but other companies (like amazon and meta) will often ask questions  copied directly from their lc tagged list. if you have an interview with  a company that asks system design questions, review grokking the system  design interview beforehand. most importantly, practice your  communication skills in mock interviews (you should pretty much always  be talking as you're coding) and prep good behavioral stories. companies  don't just want leetcode monkeys, they want people have have good soft  skills and can work on a team.  
>  
>anyway, that's my brief guide to getting a swe job with an unrelated  degree. hopefully it helps some of you who are interested in tech but  aren't in cse/info. not being a cs major honestly doesn't change much  about the process, it's just more difficult to get your first internship  and you'll have to self-study a bit more.

"detailed explanation of uw grading system **first of all, congratulations on your acceptance to uw seattle! we're happy for you to become a new husky!** now i will give some insights on how uw grading works, because uw has a totally different system from other universities.

i will introduce the following commonly used grading schemes:

1. point-based grading (pbg)
2. rank-based grading (rbg)
3. mastery-based grading (mbg)
4. contract-based grading (cbg)

&#x200b;

# 1.  point-based grading (pbg)

* this grading method is widely used for all courses **except** for cse 14x, cse 373, engl 1x1, engl 182, and introductory-level stem weedout classes. your grade is **not curved**, which you will have a grading scale with total possible points. by the end of the quarter, the percentage grade resulted from the quotient of points earned dividing total possible points automatically translates to a corresponding numeric grade.

*example*:

|percentage (%)|grade|percentage (%)|grade|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|95 - 100|4.0\*|62 - 63|0.8|
|94|3.9|60 - 61|0.7|
|93|3.8|0 - 59|0.0|

depends on your instructor, if you have an overall grade of 94.9%, the professor who rounds up all grades will give you a 4.0. otherwise, you will get a 3.9.

* **pros**: easy to navigate and manage your grade, straightforward. **you get what you earned**.
* **cons**: fixed grading scale, low scores affect your grade. the threshold for 4.0 can range from 93% to 99%.

&#x200b;

# 2. rank-based grading (rbg)

* commonly known as **grading-on-a-curve, which your grade is highly dependent on the class average and median**. **rbg is widely used in introductory-level stem weedout** classes and its purpose is to limit number of students earning grades above 3.5 to keep capacity-constrained majors remain academically competitive. there's no clear cutoff for certain grade, but your professor would say by achieving ""..."" you will guarantee a 2.0. **by the end of the quarter, the instructor will decide the course median based on the class performance and set up the cutoffs for 4.0, 2.0, and 0.7. then use interpolation to decide the other grades**.
* the introductory calculus sequence **(math 124-125-126)** curves to **2.7-3.1** median.
* the general chemistry sequence **(chem 142-152-162)** curves to **2.4-2.8** median.
* the calculus-based physics sequence **(phys 121-122-123)** curves to **2.9-3.0** median.
* the introductory biology sequence **(biol 180-200-220) limits grade of 4.0 assigned less than 7%**. course median usually swing between **2.7 and 3.2**.

*example*:

|percentage (%)|grade|percentage (%)|grade|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|97|4.0\*|72|2.5|
|91|3.5|66|2.0|
|82|3.0|50|0.7|

\*depends on the exam statistics, if the exam is hard enough that the course median before the curve is outside of the official range, then the professor will adjust the cutoff for 4.0 and/or 2.0. the minimum for a 4.0 can range from 89% to 98%.

* pros: bad exams aren't automatically fail you and the cutoff for 2.0 is usually more lenient.
* cons: extremely overwhelming and unreasonable to treat your classmates as rivalry.

&#x200b;

# 3. mastery-based grading (mbg)

* the mastery-based grading is newly proposed by cse professor kevin lin and used in cse 142, cse 143, cse 163, and cse 373 starting the 2020-2021 academic year. instead of curving the grade to a median of 2.7-3.0, the **mbg encourages students learning from their mistakes**. **you have to meet the minimum requirements for a specific grade range**.

*example*: [cse 142 syllabus (22wi)](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/22wi/syllabus.html#grading)

* pros: make the class less stressful and motivational to learn.
* cons: grade can be ambiguous at times. **mbg is not used for stuart reges' cse classes**.

&#x200b;

# 4. contract-based grading (cbg)

* the contract-based grading is used **only in the english composition courses** at uw, which at the first day of the class, you will sign a grading contract that to get a certain grade. the contract states what requirements are necessary for a specific grade (4.0, 3.5, 3.0, and etc.) once you met all the requirements, you automatically get the grade.

*example*: [engl 1x1 grading contract](https://english.washington.edu/sites/english/files/documents/ewp/teaching_resources/emily_george_grading_contracts.pdf)

* pros: straightforward, easy to manage, and no ambiguity.
* cons: you need to work for the grade you selected.

"uw or in-state? hello y'all! i was recently accepted by the uw as a pre-sciences major. i have kind of a debate in my head right now though because of it. while uw is my top choice and i would absolutely love to go (i fell in love with the school and seattle as a whole when i visited), i'm coming from colorado with little financial aid and because of how majors work i can't be sure if i'd be able to get into a more lucrative major later on to justify the price. meanwhile i am much more likely to get into my in state school (cu boulder) with better prospects in terms of price and major. so ultimately i'm torn between staying in state and playing it safe or going to uw and risking more but potentially having a better, more satisfying, and more passionate experience that could stay with me for a long time. my question is: if i get into my in state school with the major i applied for, should i still go to uw regardless of the potential risk to have a more satisfying college experience or should i just stay here? and i suppose a side question would be is it possible to still get into a decently lucrative/popular major at uw as a ""pre-whatever"" admit without having to push yourself to the limits? thank you for any advice that you all may give and if i end up choosing uw i hope to have a fantastic college experience with you :)",advice

"math 126 notes to avoid my friends asking me for this later, here are [my math 126 notion notes for dr. ostroff's class](https://www.notion.so/math-126-lecture-notes-b9c24c437f144f0b93309e39b9a52a31). all notes are formated as questions so you can quiz yourself. there's also an active recall/spaced repetition database thingy on the right side.  

**optional recall/spaced repetition database thingy:**

for this, clear all the confidence levels by switching to the all cards view > highlighting everything > edit properties > removing the confidence level tag > switch back to the test today view. after, once you start quizzing yourself, set the confidence level to how confident you are with 1 being the least confident and 5 being the most. cards in the test today view will automatically pop up on the day that you should be quizzing yourself (the lower confident cards will be tested more often than the more confident cards). 

you can also tag cards with core, moderate, advanced, and other things. one tip i have is to tag cards you think are way too easy with archived. this will make it so you will never be tested on the card again. this does not delete the card. it just is filtered out by the test today view.

"cc choice for uw engineering transfer hey,


ive been wondering if theres a specific community college that is more advantageous in terms of quality of education. i know ccs are similar for the most part, but i want to be very sure that i am getting the best quality of education within the cc options i have, so that i would have a strong foundation and wont struggle later down the road. 


 eventually i'd like to transfer to an ee program at uw, so if anyone could recommend community colleges that would provide me with the best education in classes like the calc series or phys series, that would be great.

"questions about residence halls & campus travel so i’m going to be a freshmen this fall (:d) and i was wondering if you would be willing to answer some questions for me about the campus, residence halls, and disability accommodations. i’ve already looked through uw’s website, though i might have missed something (there’s *so many* pages). if this is something that i should call or email someone about instead of taking up your guy’s time that would be helpful information too! 

thank you for your time :)

for those who are living on campus: how did you choose which residence hall to apply to/live in? i’ve heard that mcmahon and hagget don’t have free wifi which… doesn’t sound great. but i don’t know where to go from here. did you guys choose based on its distance from something? is so, what was it that you wanted to be close to? is there something that you did not want to live close to? did you choose due to the living learning communities? is there a residence hall (or type of room) that’s notorious for being challenging to live in? are some louder or quieter on average? or are they all similar enough that it’s not really a important choice? 

this is a sort of specific question but are there any residence halls that (usually) have a more reliable elevator than others? because of some medical problems i can’t walk very long (like 5-10 minutes max) and stairs are worse. 

on that line of thought, are there any residence halls that it’s easier to get disability accommodations in? i don’t think i phrased that right but essentially i meant is it easier in the more modern halls to do things like have a visual fire alarm or is the wiring not a issue despite when the hall was made? 

going back to traveling, how far do you think you have to walk in one day? what’s the most common transport (scooter, bike, etc) option you see? do you think the campus is wheelchair accessible? i know their website says so but i also wanted to ask people what it’s like to confirm lol. 

thanks for any responses :) i didn’t really know where to go and i appreciate any help you can give me! sorry for all the questions!!!





this is more personal and probably unnecessary but i’d really appreciate some help if you’re willing! i briefly mentioned it earlier but i *can* walk, just not for long or far. this is less related to housing but i still want to ask. since the campus is so big i don’t think i’ll be able to walk as much as i need to regularly. a bike *may* work since i’m sitting down but i’m not sure. and a scooter or skateboard won’t help since standing can be really painful as well. if i used a wheelchair (possibly electric because of the hills? idk) to get across campus, would it give a bad impression of me if people also saw me walking short distances? my highschool campus is small enough that i can (mostly) get by so this will be the first time that i’ve had to consider using a wheelchair for more than a day and it’s a bit nerve wracking.",advice

if you are interested in ecology/conservation/wildlife biology, do not do the biology eec (ecology, evolution, conservation) major. i transferred in from a cc where they told me it would be better for my resume/job outlook if i did bio instead of environmental science, and i stupidly listened. 

y’all. the biology eec major is bullshit. there are only a handful of actually relevant classes, you have to take ochem and physics, and what few relevant classes there actually are are focused on the ecology of microbiology. the bio department only cares about the medical field and it shows. i love science and math but this has been a huge fucking waste of credit hours. 

i, luckily, minored in esrm so i’ve been able to get better education and experience than i would have otherwise. but overall it’s really fucked me over because i’ve had to spend so many credit hours suffering for the bio requirements when i could have been taking useful esrm classes.

"graduate housing recommendations graduate housing options

hey huskies 👋 
i just got accepted into a graduate program at uw starting autumn 2022 and i’m trying to navigate the housing options available.

i have a few questions and i’d appreciate some feedback from people who’ve lived on/off campus.

1. what’s the best dorm given a trade off between equipment, price, distance to campus and social life? 
i read a few posts that mention the newer options are better. i couldn’t find anything on how the social life within specific dorms is so i’m quite clueless there. i’m (relatively??) young so i don’t mind being in a dorm that’s not exclusively for grad students and might be loud/busy.

2. is it a better option to live off campus in the surrounding areas? 
i can see multiple listings around the campus which seem very nice to live in.

3. will i end up getting a cheaper deal living and eating on campus? 
i understand that really comes down to lifestyle choices and how much i’m willing to cook but i’m interested in hearing personal experiences 

4. what’s the typical social life for graduate students? 
are you mostly just hanging out with people from your cohort or is it a mix of undergrad/other grad students?

5. tell me about your favourite bars/pubs in/around the campus! 


any other advice regarding graduate student life is appreciated. i’ll buy a round or two of beers for anyone who’s available to connect over dm.


i’ve read up a bit about the ‘seattle freeze’ so i’m hoping to kickstart my new life by making some friends before i fly over to seattle. i’m currently living in europe and it’s never been an issue for me to make friends here, i hope i can keep that streak going 🤞",advice

i believe everyone has a right to protest when it comes to racial inequality but you’re literally gonna go to a library where the rules are to be quiet so people can study and then get mad and  immediately blurt racial slurs just because someone politely asked you to be quiet? hypocrisy much? like do you even care about your movement if you’re just making yourselves look worse?

1. is it difficult to get directly into a bio major, especially considering there is no direct admit? what is the app process like?
2. how brutal are the class curves, and how has your own experience been with staying ahead of the average? how many hours a day do you typically study, and do you feel like it's feasible?
3. what is the process of gaining research / shadowing around seattle like? i've heard of opportunities at fred hutch
4. ultimately what would you choose if you were given these options for undergrad:

(1) **uw seattle** — admitted pre-sciences, you probably know more about it than i do. love the location and social fit

(2) **santa clara university** — admitted for biology, grade inflation, but no r1 research status or much name recognition. would go there freshman year while trying to transfer

(3) **baylor university** — admitted for neuroscience, $56,000 merit scholarship to my top choice program in the honors college, grade inflation. they recently gained r1 research status, but it's an absolutely terrible social/cultural fit and i wouldn't like the location

"questions - college decisions (update)  

hello everyone,

i hope you are doing well! i think i posted this question on this discussion before, but i want to receive people’s thoughts as certain things have changed monetarily. so currently as a high school senior, i have narrowed my choices down to uc berkeley eecs (direct admit) and the university of washington’s cs program as a direct admit (my in-state school).

previously, everyone advised me to choose uw due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently i learned that i was accepted for the regents and chancellor’s scholarship at berkeley. this scholarship now makes uw and berkeley cost the exact same for me. however, i am still having trouble deciding which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. the only reason i am considering staying in-state with uw is that as a dual enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, i will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with uw cs. at berkeley, i understand that eecs is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that i may have to attend university for 4 years instead. 

i know some may think this is a clear-cut choice, but i was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. for example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (i have heard from many that experience matters more than education)? what are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? overall, if cost isn't a factor, what would make you choose one over the other?

"uw or bu for econ? uw or bu?

i am debating whether i should go to bu or uw for economics (im oos for uw). 


the thing is, i live in the pacific northwest and feel a lot more comfortable being in seattle compared to boston. i also believe that seattle has a lot better internship opportunities than boston with a lot less competition (there was some statistic that said 25% of boston is college kids). 


all the factors for me seem to be leaning in uws direction except for the fact that they have the competitive major system. i don't want the stress of having to apply to study economics (or any other major that i like at uw) and risk not getting in. this is especially compounded by the fact that i really don't have a non-capacity constrained backup major.

"[cms] [french] i'm in need of irl friends & probably study buddies for summer 22 first things first, i have diagnosed dissociative identity disorder.  it is something i share with those i meet as a way of getting the eventual awkward ""i told you that story yesterday..."" type stuff out of the way.  i will not remember all stories shared at all times.  i will forget to text you back for days on end.  i will gripe about the same problems to you multiple times. probably. those are facts.

as for me, and what i'm looking for with this post... well, i'm mainly looking for some irl friends.  french is because i have bilingual cousins i run dungeons and dragons for, and wanna know some of what they're saying behind my back.  and so they can hear me nerd in multiple languages.
 i am also a voice actress, and knowing multiple languages aids my craft.

cms people i'll likely be more comfortable with, as screenwriting and scripts and the like is something i'm naturally comfortable with.

i know there's only like 5 people registered for either class right now, but i can't sleep and thought it would be neat to make a reddit post to see if i could possibly connect with some classmates and have a bit of a study group type thing, or at least some friendships, going on before the quarter starts.

feel free to chat, pm, whatever.  i just wanna know if there's anybody else on reddit in those classes looking for a friend or study buddy, i guess.

if not allowed, i apologize.  i'm just really lonely and in need of more people to talk to that wanna get me to leave my house since my work has me stuck inside all day.

i applied for cs and engineering and didn't get into either (i didn't expect to at all, i understand how competitive it is). i know it's virtually impossible to transfer in later on and i'm not going on a wild goose chase for that so i looked into other options. the uw offered some cs alternatives i could consider, and the main ones i would like to go into are acms (data science & statistics), applied math, informatics, or statistics. 

now, i assumed that since these were offered as alternatives in the colleges of arts & sciences it would be relatively easy to get into one of these, even thought they were capacity constrained. i looked into it, and the recent acceptance rates for all of these hovered around 30% (or lower)! i guess my question is, how do i know what prerequisites to complete if i only have a small chance of getting into any of these majors? i know i'm fearing the worst, but i'm so afraid of completing the necessary pre-recs for these programs and getting denied from all of them - what do i do then? do i have to redo all my pre-recs so i can go in a different direction? i feel like i'm overthinking this or looking too much into it, any answers to my questions are much appreciated :') sorry for the long frantic post",advice

"uw major system and registration master guide as we entering the second half of the spring quarter, lots of you may already committed to uw. **first of all, congratulations! i am very proud of you getting accepted by uw!** now i am going to give more insights on how the major system and registration at uw work. 

&#x200b;

# 1. major system

**1.1 types of majors** [all majors](http://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) at uw can be categorized into five levels:

**level 1 (open)**: you can declare the major ***anytime*** as long as the cumulative gpa is above 2.0.

* **level 2 (minimum requirements)**: you need to complete the required prerequisites with an overall gpa of 2.50 and higher, and the cumulative gpa is also 2.00 or higher.
* **level 3 (less selective)**: the least competitive type of capacity-constrained majors. in addition to the requirement on prerequisites, you have to complete additional application or essay prompts. ***majors at this level usually have an acceptance rate above 50%***.
* **level 4 (moderately selective)**: most of the stem majors at uw fall in this level, which ***the acceptance rate is less than 50% but above 20%***. very similar to level 3 majors, but you need to earn ***stellar grades (above 3.7)*** to guarantee the acceptance.
* **level 5 (most selective)**: for any majors with ***an acceptance rate under 20%, unless you have an extraordinary gpa (3.9+) with unique ps and cv, i would not suggest you wasting quarters to apply***. if you still wish to pursue similar paths, please try to get the prerequisites done so you can apply for level 3 or level 4 majors. 

&#x200b;

**1.2 some of the commonly applied or heard majors:**

* biology - level 3
* computer science/engineering - level 5
* applied mathematics - level 5
* engineering - level 3 or 4 (depends on your path)
* psychology - level 3 or 4 (vary by quarter)
* education (eco) - level 3 (4 if you're a sophomore)
* statistics - level 4
* mathematics - level 4
* english - level 2
* acms - level 5
* political science - level 2
* informatics - level 4 (vary by quarter)
* economics - level 3 or 4 (vary by quarter)
* any foster - level 4

&#x200b;

**1.3 tips on declaring majors:**

* if you're ***not*** dtm (direct-to-major) or dtc (direct-to-college) but ***dreaming for level 4 or 5 majors***, please have at least one level 1 or 2 major planned. undergraduate is your best time to explore different academic interests.
* if you come to uw with ***more than*** ***30 transfer credits*** (2 quarters equivalency), you're expected to declare a major ***by the winter quarter of your second year***. otherwise, a registration hold will be placed on your account until a major is declared, according to the [105-credit rule](https://registrar.washington.edu/registration/policies-procedures/).
* run your dars (**d**egree **a**udit and **r**eport **s**ystem) featured on myplan periodically to check your academic progress. when in doubt, do not hesitate to seek for help, even for level 1 or 2 majors.

&#x200b;

# 2. registration

in november, you will have your first registration at uw as an enrolled student. and the registration is always a pain to rant about. here i am providing some strategies on how to painlessly register for your classes.

&#x200b;

**2.1 your registration date**

you can see your registration for the upcoming quarter during week 4 of the current quarter on myuw. and your [registration date (winter 2023 as an example)](https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-priorwi23/) is based on your [class standing](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/undergraduate-class-standings/), **not year at uw**. if you don't pay attention, do not worry. you can simply look it up by typing on the searching bar on your browser:

https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-prior**\[quarter\]\[year\]**/

* \[quarter\]: **au - autumn**, **wi - winter**, **sp - spring, su - summer**
* \[year\]: **last 2 digits of the calendar year (e.g. 22 as 2022)**

&#x200b;

**2.2 registration periods:**

* period 1: friday of week 6 to sunday of week 8
* period 2: monday of week 9 to the last day before the upcoming quarter starts
* period 3: the first week of the upcoming quarter
* **note that the registration for period 2 and 3 starts at 00:00 midnight, not 06:00 am! for example, if period 1 registration for autumn 2022 is may 6th to june 19th, then period 2 registration starts at 00:00 on june 20th!**
* **incoming freshmen are registering for fall classes during the a&o, so please ignore the period 1 restrictions if autumn 2022 is your first quarter at uw.**

&#x200b;

**2.3 platform**

use **sln page** to register. myplan sometimes drive people crazy.

&#x200b;

**2.4 check the requirements & restrictions**

before the registration starts, please **check** whether you satisfied the requirements or not. the most common are:

* you need to be in certain majors to register during period 1, 2, or 3
* you need to a certain class standing to register during period 1, 2, or 3
* you need either 0.7 (d-), 1.7 (c-), 2.0 (c), 2.2 (c+), or 3.0 (b) to be eligible for advanced courses
* you need to be matriculated student **(45 uw credits)**

&#x200b;

**2.4.1 example (mgmt 402): major & class standing restrictions**

[mgmt 402 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/eovpphiqtsv81.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9fc67e2b1842047fe1df1da7f0cae871037dd2)

to be eligible for mgmt 402, you need:

* have 90 or more total credits earned (junior status)
* admitted to foster, or you must wait until june 20th or your registration date

&#x200b;

**2.4.2 example (math 125): major & class & prereq restrictions**

[math 125 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/5484bjvkvsv81.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=300ed8a17e907f0a741fc264f5fffd500982cefd)

[math 125 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/t212eybnvsv81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=0605bcee18452dd2d35d88947995ff88e7380f75)

to be eligible for math 125, you need:

* finish \*math 124 or have equivalent ap/ib exam scores
* not in math, stat, or acms majors
* **the ""cancellation in effects"" means that if you ended up a 1.9 and lower on math 124, the registration system will remove you from math 125 when the grade is posted.**

\*math 124 has no prerequisite unless you took math 120 (need 2.5+).

i’ve never been a “math person” and have struggled with the subject throughout high school. i’m really worried about being absolutely obliterated by a pre req math class and consequently risking my chances of getting into my desired major. if there are any current students who are similarly shit at math and who were admitted into pre-social sciences, i’d love to hear your experiences with the major. thank you!",advice

i am currently in a dilemma as to whether i should attend udub (university of washington) as an oos resident. for context, i am a californian student who got accepted to udub and directly admitted to biochemistry. i plan on pursuing pre-med; however, because the future is so unnpredictable, this might change. should i back out of pre-med, i plan to pursue either engineering or cs. 

as for about myself, i consider myself to be a very hardworking student. i go to a fairly competitive high school in the bay area, and have maintained all as throughout my high school except in english 9h (so my gpas is around 3.94uw). i taken a total of 8 ap courses (all as) and got all 4s and 5s on them. i am willing to take initiative and grasp any opportunities that come into my way. i consider myself to be very studious and am always willing to improve or put effort to understand any concepts better.

based on all that, i was wondering if i will be able to hold the academic rigor that uwash has so that i can get into a good medical school? uwash has so many amazing opportunities, and i absolutely love the campus. however, what is really holding me back is the academic rigor that might affect my gpa. is it worth the oos tuition as opposed to instate?

after getting rejected from uw nursing the second time, i started applying to associate degree programs in the seattle metro area, including north seattle college, seattle central college, south seattle college, shoreline community college, and lake washington institute of technology. i got into the associate degree in nursing program at lake washington institute of technology in fall 2020 and will be graduating this june. for anyone who is worried about not being able to get a certain job or get into a hospital position without a bachelor’s in nursing, those fears are unfounded. with a year or so of hospital experience as a nursing assistant and while i am still enrolled in school, i was able to get a job offer with two different hospitals in their nurse residency programs. i don’t even graduate for another two months and i am not even enrolled in a rn-bsn program yet, and i still got hospital job offers. 

what this means for current and prospective uw students looking to study nursing is this: uw nursing is not the only option for getting your nursing degree, and community colleges are an amazing option to pursue your nursing education. you will most likely be able to get a job in a hospital before you even graduate. with regards to prerequisites, community colleges offer smaller class sizes, it is easier to get better grades (no curves and weird competitiveness), and they are much cheaper (~$3900 per quarter at uw versus ~$1300 per quarter at north seattle college (most wa state community colleges are pretty similar in cost iirc)). the entire cost of my nursing program at lake washington institute of technology was maybe $16,000 over six quarters, plus there were technology grants and scholarships available as well, whereas uw costs around $24,000 over six quarters (correct me if i am wrong). you also do not need to spend a huge amount of money attending seattle university or seattle pacific university just to have your bsn degree a few months sooner. community college nursing programs also have application cycles 2 or 3 times per year, whereas uw only has admissions in january once per year, meaning that if you receive a rejection for fall quarter, you can apply again for winter quarter without a problem rather than waiting another ten months to apply again.  

one concern as well many people have about associate degree in nursing programs is that you will eventually have to get a rn-bsn degree. both hospitals i interviewed with told me that they have scholarship programs, both full and partial, to pay for you to get your rn-bsn. you can work full-time as a nurse and complete your rn-bsn, since classes meet (at least at uw bothell) once every two weeks. (i believe seattle children’s does require you to have your bsn for new hires, but i know people who have been working there as a nursing assistant and are able to get a job as a nurse there).

if you are a prospective student looking to come to uw for nursing or even if you are a current pre-nursing student at uw taking their prerequisites, i would recommend looking at taking your prerequisites (or the remainder of them) at a community college to save money, get higher grades without a curve, and have smaller class sizes to develop relationships with professors for recommendations. apply to multiple nursing programs at community colleges and apply every quarter you can, so that you can maximize your chances of getting into one as soon as possible and start your education and career. still apply to uw for nursing, and if you get in you should definitely attend since uw is one of the best nursing schools in the country. but do not sit around and wait a whole other year to try again if you do not get in the first time. i’m sure it changed in the year or so since i applied, but when i applied the first time in 2019, 80 students out of ~700 got in, and the second time i applied in 2020, 80 students out of ~600 got in. don’t put all your eggs in one basket by only focusing on the uw program. you will be an amazing nurse no matter where you go to school as long as you put in the effort and stay curious.

**info application essay advice:**

**present yourself as matching the informatics school mission/values/self-descriptors:**

<i wish i could just put my screenshot here, but refer page 2-3 of this brochure for the mission statement and descriptions. frame yourself in what they describe> [https://issuu.com/uwischool/docs/infobrochure\_2020](https://issuu.com/uwischool/docs/infobrochure_2020)

""a program that focuses on computer systems from a user-centered perspective and studies the structure, behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store, process and communicate information. includes instruction in information sciences, human computer interaction, information system analysis and design, telecommunications structure and information architecture and management.""

its not just tech (cs is about making the best tech), not just people (that’s social sciences), not just information. privacy, security, legal, intellectual property, human factors in tech, web and mobile development, social media, politics, the tech world, statistics, journalism.

make sure its clear you know what informatics is and that **you specifically** fit it (you don’t actually have to know what informatics is, i barely do, so say what they say)

&#x200b;

**this is about you**

what classes or things peaked curiosity, why are you here, what is important to you specifically.

really think about why you like informatics, why did you choose it, what is it about you that will make you good at it.

* i didn't think i cared that much about informatics until i worked on this essay, i realized why i really wanted to get in.

have a focused idea/topic/goal for the essay and make sure it is clear. this i struggled with. the essay prompt is barely a prompt, it's more like things they want you to mention.

topic ideas: (but please use stuff that actually works for you, erase these from your mind before brainstorming)

* how you found informatics, how you found whatever informatics concentration you like, something you struggled with (like communicating your ideas, finding your role, personal stuff) that info helps with, a specific instance, or an experience you had like club/job/volunteer/school.

try to make a story; doesn’t have to be super narrative, but show your growth don’t just brag.

* mine wasn't a single narrative story, i talked about the three times i have done projects about prison advocacy, and used it to show my progression over time getting better at communicating ideas as i got more into informatics.

don’t write it like a paper or resume, its about your connection to it and the humanistic aspects of the program. write it to be understandable for someone who isn’t in informatics, because some of the reviewers (apparently) aren’t informatics people.

""highlight your passion about the subject (could talk about a project you did during info 200/201 and how you wanted to expand on it). see if you can expand on it.""

be yourself and show who **you** are, but don't feel bad about creating a smarter/kinder/girlbossier/informatics version of yourself

&#x200b;

**here’s how i broke down the prompt:**

(but smoosh all the questions together into one story)

**experiences with information**.

how have you used tech/data to help you/others or if you haven't really, how can you using tech/data help the next generation

do you not have “experiences with information technology”? i'm sure there is stuff you can still write about and this is broad enough that i’m sure you have an experience with information, especially related to diversity/equity.

* clubs, personal projects, volunteering, personal relationships, social media, organizations. anything related to information technology or data or the internet could work

but it can’t hurt to find some if what you have doesn’t feel compelling:

* use projects from the info classes you took, making sure that you show how that experience was specific to you or your life to differentiate yourself from everyone else who also took those classes.

get a job/ extracurriculars. maybe it doesn’t have to be super social justicey or perfect, but just to show experience

extracurriculars:

* info viz
* hackathons or computer science clubs/groups
* poduw (polling and open data initiative)
* if you want to do design:
   * huskyadapt; seal lab; design for america
* swe
* other techy rso’s or any rso where you can be the web design/techy person for them
* do volunteer data entry or data related stuff for a non-profit, look at [volunteermatch.org](http://volunteermatch.org/)

i was stressed so really wanted stuff like this to look better. i didn’t end up talking about it in depth but i bet you could get a whole story out of it. i mentioned data entry volunteering for a nonprofit but it was more helpful because i thought of my whole idea from connecting it to the rest of my life.

also remember they don’t fact check you so… go ahead and make it sound cooler than it was

&#x200b;

**experiences with diversity, equity, and inclusion**

not solely focusing on your identity/oppression, make sure its related to how technology played a negative or positive role in it, and then tie it to what you did/want to do to change it (preferably using information technology). it doesn't have to be as related to tech as the last question, but make sure your ""backstory"" actually flows with the whole essay.

possible things

* intersections of your identity
* advocacy
* political exclusion and technological exclusion
* misinformation is something they really care about
* social media

this is the ""human-centered"" part of informatics, show that you care about people and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

&#x200b;

**goals after college**

if you don’t have a specific career goal, approach it as how the major matches with your values and personal goals.

* i talked about combining helping people and advocacy with a logical, practical base. and how moving around a bunch of majors let me know info was good for me in the future

find faculty or a specific class or what about the school that will help further goals, this will make them think the i school is central to your future and you can't get it anywhere else.

* it could help to name drop one of your professors and say you’re interested in their work.
* look into research groups at the i school
   * i talked about wanting to learn about the center for informed public group and masters programs.

info is a backup major for a lot of people, and its also broad enough that it can be a catch-all. convince the reader that info specifically is what you need and want.

“show how you’ve made a positive impact on the world around you and describe how you being an info major will help you to continue on this trajectory""

what is it about informatics and about yourself that will make you stick with this in the future.

&#x200b;

**learning skills**

brag about your grade for a class, and make sure it ties into the rest of the essay. this wasn't super central to my essay approach so i don't have much advice for it; though i'm sure there's a way to make the whole story about your class experience and you coming out with a good grade. they don't care much about your grades so use this as an opportunity to highlight your academic best.

&#x200b;

**general essay advice**

700 words is a short essay, make sure it is straightforward and cohesive (do as i say not as i do) and there's a clear point that you successfully gets across -ask people if it gets across.

reach out to informatics advisors or ta’s or professors

utilize drop in tutoring at study center or use clue

get feedback on what you write, even if you, like me, hate people reading your writing. i am very grateful for my friend who read my first draft and said ""this sh\*t makes no sense, it's making my dyslexia worse"". that hurted, but i needed it.

start early, i thought i started early and still worked on it up to when it was due. start earlier. talk through your ideas with people and get people to read your stuff, then restart- ask early on so it is constructive.

anytime you think about informatics, write it down for later because you can use it. this essay forced me to be very introspective for a while. maybe i am just an over-thinker, but still, brainstorm for a long time. (i did get caught up on trying to use all of it, so be mindful that not everything can be included).

give yourself the best chance with a well written essay. i do think content is most important -i actually had a few typos. (please don't bring it up i'm so embarrassed)

&#x200b;

**a collection of other people’s blocks of advice:**

(this is not cited i am very sorry but i genuinely don't remember who said what)

1:

show how you’ve made a positive impact on the world around you and describe how you being an info major will help you to continue on this trajectory. think of something that’s a big part of your life and talk about how you used it to make a positive impact and if you don’t have anything like that, find something. they care a lot about being passionate

2:

tell a overarching narrative: “for me, i like design, so i explained how i started off in polisci, but i found that it was too theoretical, and not practical. i learned in polisci how inequitable the world is, but no matter the studying i did, i couldn’t change the world around me. then i found design. i could make things to physically change the world around me, and i fell in love. “

be explicit with your previous experiences : “i participated in x rso, and i designed y for z to make it more equitable.” tie it into the overarching narrative. “i made things with my hands, and i saw how much i was able to impact someone’s life for the better, without us, they would’ve faced x inequality.”

be explicit why info: “i learned a lot in x rso, and i learned how much i want to be a designer post college to make the world around me more equitable. informatics will allow me to do that because it offers me x resources, unlike y.”

3:

paragraph 1: talk about a hardship that you have faced - preferably one that is from systemic bias.

paragraph 2: talk about how you persevered, despite said hardship.

paragraph 3: talk about how your perseverance sparked a passion to work on solving that hardship for others.

paragraph 4: talk about how you learned about the ischool while becoming passionate about working on that hardship's solution.

paragraph 5: talk about why you feel the ischool will best help you gain the tools you need to help others with this hardship (since you plan on making this passion your lifelong pursuit). (be specific here. mention a faculty that you feel would be a great resource or mentor because of some specific work (s)he has done. especially if he or her was one of your 200 instructors ***and likes you*** or is on the admission board.)

4:

**tip #1: start your application essay early! this means brainstorming, drafting, and all of the basic writing processes. create a good list in your brainstorming of projects you could talk about or any social experiences that made an impact on you.**

my first essay read like a resume and that was not the key at all. the essay (if the prompt is the same as mine) should be a story about you and a specific experience(s) that where you learned from and applied the views/values/mission of the ischool's pillars.

sure, getting rejected the first time hurt a lot because it increased my anxiety about not having a major. however, the key is to keep grinding and have no regrets. therefore, on my second try, i put in a lot more time and effort. my google doc draft ended up having 40+ pages of notes and drafts that i took over the span of 3 months because i kept editing the same essay. if i got rejected here - then it would still hurt, but i would have no regrets because i did my 100% best on the application. 

**tip #2: a growth mindset is very important. being able to bounce back from failure and be even better is important. put your 100% effort into things and have no regrets about the outcome. expect the worse; but hope for the best.**

i'm still experiencing this mindset right now in my internship interview processes after getting mountains of rejections and no offers. it hurts - but i believe in myself and i'm grinding for my optimism! 

**tip #3: learning how to scope your essay and focusing on specific experiences in my life helped me describe how i implemented the ischool's values into my thinking and learning.** talk about what you've learned from info classes like this class and how you applied that to your future experiences of doing things - work, academics, hackathons, etc.

**tip #4: have a clear goal of what you want to do and communicate your journey with it.** your pursuit of passion should be clear and not vague at all.

tip #5: **understand that the ischool doesn't need their applicants - the applicants need the ischool so make sure to talk about how the ischool's resources will let you reach your goal.** for example, i talked about the possibility of working with specific professors in the tech policy lab and i brought examples of what i learned from info 300 into my work experiences.

**tip #6: take more info classes other than info 200 and info 201.** this step may not be absolutely necessary; but, it can help you understand the principles of informatics as a whole. i took info 300 and the 3 classes alone were able to help me get the major. however, i have gotten tips to take as many info classes as you can so you can talk about how you implemented aspects of what you learned from the class to your story.

**tip #7: make sure your essay is a story about you.** assume that they are going to read your essay one time through because they're tired of reading applications all day. reading boring resumes like my first essay definitely didn't make an impact on them. however, writing a story about myself and my journey towards my goal of ""\[becoming\] an aspiring software engineer... to design empathy-driven technology so information can be universally accessible"" made it clear what i wanted to do.

i literally had my info 300 professor read over my essay and he said it was straight-up boring. the guy literally plugged in the hero's journey chart into my google doc as well and i got traumatic high-school english flashbacks. but it made sense why he did that. 

**tip #8: use as many resources as you can. this means showing your paper to friends, family, professors, tas, the info student admission helpers, the writing center, etc.** they will provide criticism on what is clear, what can be improved, and what should be emphasized. also, make sure to ask for their first impressions because you must hit all of the marks on the dot right from the get-go. ultimately, you don't have to implement all of their feedback, and it's up to you to choose which feedback would be beneficial for your vision because not all of the feedback you get will be constructive towards that target.

**tip #9: try to read the essays of admitted students to see what aspects they emphasize to align with the values of the ischool.** however, take this with a grain of salt because you definitely do not want to copy them. it's your story you're writing about, not theirs.

&#x200b;

**backups for informatics:**

* geographical information studies
* design major
* foster information systems path
* do minor in informatics which isn’t capacity constrained
* panic and pick something random (most majors have a data science concentration)
* do something and then get a masters like the msim or msds
* check the rest of uw reddit there’s plenty of ideas (uw restricting majors is so dumb and its so stupid that we have to think up backup majors when we’re giving them money this school is dumb)

are there any possible scenarios where the kid's explanation holds water? one thing i can hypothesize is that the kid applied for early graduation (attending ceremony before finishing their last semester; not sure if udub has such an option), attended graduation, then cancelled their last semester before the class drop deadline, ultimately not completing their courses yet.",advice

"transfer decision hello,

i am currently a sophomore student aspiring to be a software engineering or any career related to that field. but i have been currently stuck in deciding for my next steps. 

i recently got accepted at uw seattle for its acms (dma) major as a transfer student from a community college. i applied for cs allen school as my first major choice but apparently i got rejected from the cs department i aimed for. apparently, i also got accepted to the csse major at uw bothell.

in terms of career prospect, what should i decide between the acms (dma) major at uw seattle and csse major at uw bothell? i initially thought that the dma program would be closely related to cs but i am worried that i would not be either enjoying the major itself or i will find difficulties in finding jobs with this degree. i have many connections of cs graduates who currently works at big tech companies and i could only find a single person who actually graduated with the acms (dma) major but he's currently working as quality engineer (i have done a little research about it but i'm still not sure what it is all about). 

a few things about myself, i am personally not a math person even though i don't often struggle with the concepts. i really enjoy coding/programming in general, i like building stuffs with programming but i also appreciate optimizations of algorithm to speed things up (e.g. data structures) which i believe are the things we learn from cs major. i have even built some fun side programming projects such as websites and discord bot myself. and as i said, i applied to acms as my 2nd choice since i believe it is close to cs and i felt like i would have no problem dealing with the math. i have taken linear algebra and ordinary differential equations with no issue and i got perfect 4.0 gpa for both. i feel like uw bothell's csse has good reputations but i find some friends of mine struggle a lot in getting internships and jobs. it must definitely be a struggle to get jobs from either school but i have always believed that uw seattle has greater opportunities in that regard. also may be unrelated with everything, i am not sure if this would also be a factor but i am actually an international student (from indonesia) and so are most of my friends (or connections) who i referred to.

would anyone mind giving some insights to this problem i have? i would really appreciate any thoughts on this. thank you in advance.",advice

university district has much more apartments to choose from, thus i am able to find a cheaper rent. from the videos, it also looks more vibrant with more shops (so more convenient). however, the crime rating is f according to areavibes: [https://www.areavibes.com/seattle-wa/university+district/crime/](https://www.areavibes.com/seattle-wa/university+district/crime/). i heard some horror stories as well around university district.

university village / laurelhurst / ravenna are much safer (b+ crime rating), but the number of apartments are much lesser and more expensive. i also heard that many older people or family with young children living there. much safer, but also much boring.

for those living on campus, should i bring my car? how is parking for residents? if i didn't have a car, would i be missing out on a lot of events and struggle to get around? is tacoma walkable/bikeable?

what kinds of clubs and organizations/societies are there and how many? (my current university has 300+ so i was wondering if it was comparable). 

what kind of demographics are there on campus? liberal vs conservative, young vs old(er), serious vs partying, etc. 

is there a good support system (academically) for students? are the advisors actually good? is there a career advising center? how are the tutors, if there are tutors.

do you suggest working while being a full-time student? i haven't been during the school year but was also taking a very heavy course load. how many hours per week would you say you spend dedicated to school (i'm hoping to be an urban design or sustainable urban development major). 

thanks in advance!",student life

"hella cheap $800 furnished room where you don't have to deal with hfs n shitty landlords [pics](https://imgur.com/a/0cdigar)

i graduated a while back and now my family owns a house near the ranier beach light rail station. it takes 40 minutes to get to uw station including walking and you only have to take the light rail so you can cram study before class. since it's one of the first stops you always get a seat.

the house is a 3 floor unit in a duplex. you get the master bedroom with a private bathroom with shower, closet, and south facing window to the street so at least there's a nice view for when you contemplate your life choices. the room is furnished with a queen bed, desk, and white board. 

there are two roommates, my cousin (f) and my brother. my cousin is taiwanese and is almost never home. my brother lives on the basement floor and is not very social so you won't see him much either but if you are trying to get into cs you should try to make friends with him because he is a very talented programmer and can help you with your math/physics/cs homework.

i still could not believe what had happened. i am a 6-foot-tall, 220 pounds, masculine guy. and i was in my karate gi, on my way to practice. it was around 6 pm, the platform was full of people.

i would think this will make me the least likely target for anyone to pick up a fight on the street, as well as the worst time, right? nope. this man bumped straight into me and kept aggression toward me for a couple of minutes, in a combat-ready stance.

i tried to break the engagement distance, and kept trying to talk him out of this while retreating in a fully defensive stance. he threats to beat me up, and i was cornered to the end of the platform. i felt adrenaline rushing, and i'm out of choice. lucky the train came just in time, and i am able to get out of there as he did not follow me.

this man is an african american, about 6 to 6 feet 1, 230 - 240 pounds. chubby build, with long beards. his behavior (movement, language) seems a bit off, might be on drugs. please be careful if you see him.

i was scared. he might as well as be armed with a knife, or possibly with a firearm? what if the train didn't come? we would have had a really bad fight--i can feel his hostile intention. i have absolutely nothing on me, except my bare hand. i am a 6 feet, 220-pound man, with martial arts training. but i was still sacred, very.

consider this is mid of the day, and i am not even alone, shits still happen. i felt the need for more self-defense measures. however, after looking through university policy, anything i could think of -- pistol, taser, knives, brass knuckles, batons, pepper sprays. all prohibited. i felt powerless realizing if this happens again, i could do nothing to prepare, and nothing if he choose to harm me.

"making friends for 2022-2023 year - rsos in particular! hello!

i am starting my 3rd/senior year, with my first two years being whack and mostly (95%) online due to my class arrangements. i have been actively involved in an rso and held many, many officer positions and also research where i have become an admin, so i definitely have put myself out there lol. i know a bunch of people from high school, my job, and some zoom classes who go to uw and have connected on social media, etc.

however, i don't have a single close friend to study with, have coffee, talk about our classes, etc. just a couple people here and there who i have no special connection with ;\^;

i was wondering what rsos would be good to join for minimal commitment but meet lots of people across many different majors and walks of life? just anything fun. i have also considered doing a class at the ima but thats a secondary option due to work.

all advice is appreciated for meeting people this year!! :d

pros:

he teaches like a zombie and seems to have no interest in teaching. his lectures are very monotonous and boring with no class interaction at all. half the class were browsing their phones by the end of the class.

he seems to be very knowledgeable in the subject but i don't think he should be teaching a class of young, impressionable students.

his rate my professor is one of the worst and there's even a rating from a 1994 alum saying koblitz was awful back then and that he is shocked he's still teaching.

i’m not saying there is full on segregation at uw, my friend group is a pretty big mix of ethnicities and i actually have a pretty easy time making friends with international students too, but like…it’s prominent enough to notice. considering uw affiliated mentoring programs allow students to pick the race of their mentor, uw definitely encourages this behavior ",student life

i'm a colorado junior, who's thinking applying to uw for pre-med next year(either biology or another related science major.) i really love the idea of attending this school - seattle has always been a city i've wished to live in, the liberal environment is enticing, the school itself is amazing, and it has a beautiful campus. i believe i have extremely high chances of getting in, but the price tag scares me a bit. for an out of state student, the price tag is around 50k annually. if you subtract grants and federal aid from that, its around 40k a year. (120k total) my parents have expressed that they a) cannot help me pay for college (they don't make that much, and i have multiple other siblings), and b) aren't willing to do so. so, i'd basically be on my own. i probably cannot get state residency, and neither am i willing to.

the next day (tuesday, day of 126 exam), i plan to visit the ima at least twice before the midterm (begins at 2:30 pm). in these two sessions, i will attempt to target areas that will produce the most odor, such as my asshole. i suspect i will thoroughly start smelling like a rancid cumrag at this point.

i plan to arrive somewhat late to the exam and try to strategically seat myself in the middle of the room. my hopes are that my putrid body odor will distract exam-takers in the room there-by lowering the curve.

general stats:

* gpa: 3.96
* coursework: 10 aps (currently enrolled in calc bc)
* sat: 1490 (770 math, 720 english)
* extracurriculars: member of school's coding club for 3 years (not an officer), did research with professors from oregon health science university and university of texas san antonio in computational biology and ai.

&#x200b;

issues with my application:

i am currently enrolled in ap calculus bc, but at my school there is a group of math individuals who are 1 year ahead (currently enrolled in linear algebra & multivariable calculus). however, while i am not in those classes i do know both subjects quite well as both of my mentors made it a point for me to learn them and so i have self-studied both over the past 3 years. so i don't really know how to get that across as part of my research. 

my school has a mst (magnet) program that i am currently not in. i never really applied for it and so i wasn't able to be a part of this research program. however, i think that a major part of my application is research-based so the fact that im not in my school's stem research program is hard for me to explain.   


advice:  
if anyone has any advice for how to explain the two inconsistencies in my application that would be amazing. i was thinking of using the optional essay but i don't really have a reason besides my school denied my request to take math over the summer or move up and i don't know if ""well i am not in the classes but i do know the subjects"" is a viable excuse.   
any advice for how to explain not being in the school's mst program. i kind of want it to get across that i have done high-level research but i do not know where or how i would relay that information appropriately.

# biomedical health informatics track

\*\*\*bhi is a track, so you must be admitted to the informatics major to declare your track. to do this, just schedule a meeting with an info advisor and they'll help you out from there.\*\*\*

these experiences will vary based on your professor and when you take the course. i will rate the classes on difficulty level out of 10, workload out of 10, interesting content out of 10, and whether the class is an easy 4.0. make sure to look up the professors on ratemyprof before registering for the class!

&#x200b;

**bime 300 - transformational technologies for biology, medicine, and health:**

this class was not the most exciting class, but presented some difficulty as there is some programming with pandas and jupyter. this class explored the health systems and the intersections between informatics and medicine. there were a lot of assignments that i found didn't help with learning, and the professor did not go over how to do the code (he just assumed that you would be able to do it because the prereq is info 201). a lot of students felt lost, and a lot of my group-mates straight up did not help with group projects (but this is probably due to being online). the only things graded are reading responses, group projects, presentations, and participation.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* reading responses due tuesdays and thursdays
* oral presentation (tell-a-story). this is very lowkey, you get to choose your topic and story to tell.
* 3 team projects. these involve a coder and a writer, but the professor ended up not balancing this so well with teams. make sure to try and get more than 2 people in a team. from my memory, there is some data handling with thousands of medical data which involves filtering, analyzing clinical notes, and finding genetic data to prescribe medical advice.
* lateness policy on a case-by-case basis, doesn't provide late days for assignments.

difficulty: 6/10

workload: 9/10 \*

interest: 3/10

easy 4.0? more like ez 3.5 - prof is a harsh grader zzz

professor: john gennari

\* lots busy work :( and lots of time teaching yourself jupyter if you have never used it before. i also was assigned as the coder for most of the projects, so i was paired with freshman/sophomores that have never taken a coding course somehow (info 201 is a suggested prereq, not required).

&#x200b;

**info 486 - designing for personal health and wellness:**

i thoroughly enjoyed this course. most work is done with group projects, developing an app to promote personal health and wellness. we get to explore how to make these sorts of apps effective with high usability. the professor was super engaging and accommodating. i definitely felt like i learned the most from this course. it gave a similar learning vibe as info 360, with plenty of time to work with your groups in class.

the labs were definitely the most redundant, but you need to attend for credit.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* reading responses (30%), due before every class (twice a week)
* group project (40%). this is graded by multiple deliverables throughout the quarter.
* individual assignments (15%). written reflection papers, lab assignments.
* participation (15%). this is very loosely graded. i took this online and you only needed to 'react' every once in a while.
* slightly strict with deadlines, but will accommodate with you if there is a good reason.

difficulty: 2/10

workload: 5.5/10

interest: 8/10

easy 4.0? yah

professor: erin beneteau

&#x200b;

**bime 435 - informatics in healthcare:**

bime 300 but less code, more app design. the course goes more in depth about the healthcare systems and technology. i honestly can't recall enjoying this course very much, but it followed the basic standards of an info class with developing an app without any programming. the professor is super kind and doesn't grade harshly. labs were mostly recaps/time to work with your groups.

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* buying the book is not necessary.
* course topics:
   * the us healthcare system
   * foundations of informatics in healthcare
   * application in clinical informatics
* weekly assignments (35%). quizzes, discussion boards, other assignments. quizzes are fairly easy if you skim the assigned readings.
* labs (35%)
* final project (30%). written and oral reports, had to present with group in front of the class about the project we developed.
* late assignments can be turned in at a cost of a few points (can't earn full credit).

**info 478 - population health informatics:**

coding, coding, coding. get ready to use the r language that you learned about 2 years ago. the lecture content was extremely boring to me, and since it was an 8:30 am class, i have to be transparent and say i barely went to class. she recorded lectures so i definitely used panapto to go back when she explains certain topics or assignments. i would honestly recommend *not* skipping lectures, as they were helpful for the assignments. this class is all about data visualization and representation. you have assignment deliverables similar to info 201, as well as a final group project. i honestly don't know how i earned a 4.0, but i'm assuming that if i can do it, so can you :d

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* workbooks (30%) 1pt each every week.
* assignments (35%) 10 pts each, usually every week.
* course project (35%). you begin to work on this around 3 weeks before finals.
* super flexible grading. you can submit late work within a week and still get 100% credit.

# other courses to mention

**info 442 - cooperative software development:**

as you may be able to tell, i'm not a coder by any means. in this class, you get to create a team of 2 developers, 1 product manager, and 1 designer to *cooperatively develop* a web app. this course is similar to info 340 in that you will need to have some experience with front-end development. pm and designer definitely have the easier job. the lectures weren't exactly helpful to the overall project, but it was interesting to learn about how real products are made, including developing pitches, timelines, and program versions.

*for seniors thinking about capstone group formation, a lot of people (including myself and my team) found our teammates for capstone in this class. try to find people with similar project interests as you!*

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* going to class is required - you are graded based on creating your agenda each day with your team (what you accomplished the last week, what you're going to accomplish this week, and any questions you have for the ta/professor)
* labs are super easy activities. you learn about integrity, working with a team. i honestly hope they change the structure of this, it felt like a waste of time as a senior who already learned this 40 times during my time at uw.
* course reading is free and required. i learned a lot from the book and it helped with my understanding in the class. also, if you have your info 340 book, be prepared to keep that tab open.
* assigned and selected readings (14 pts)
* labs (20 pts)
* project assignments (56 pts)
* final presentation (10 pts)
* extra credit is available
* no penalty for late submission of *reading or lab assignments.*

easy 4.0? nope. but a 3.5+ is very doable with minimal effort.

professor: cheri allen

\* difficulty will be based on what role you are. the developers definitely had the harder job, but as the pm, i did my best to support my team and offered extra insight/help.

&#x200b;

**cse 163 - intermediate data programming:**

i'm not a coder. i wanted to avoid cse 143 like the plague. i heard that this class is much easier and i believe this to be true. hunter is a great lecturer and is super engaging, the content that you learn is actually really helpful for other info courses/bhi track courses (you learn pandas, python, jupyter - would be great to take this before bime 300). the final project was definitely my favorite part of the class, we got to present our posters at the end in a fair. the grading is much more lenient, and you get resubmissions. i'd say the format is similar to cse 142, but there are no tests, just graded weekly checkpoints. i learned the best from the lectures, so don't skip those!

*syllabus/assignment breakdown:*

* checkout any cse 163 website, [this](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163/22sp/) is the one from my quarter.

# ta-da!

that's my personal experience with bhi! i do feel like i learned a lot of valuable skills and enjoyed my time in the program. a lot of the courses go over the same content, but also expanded on more topics with each class i took. i personally didn't realize how much coding there would be, especially in bime 300, but they were manageable.

let me know if there is anything else i should add to this post and feel free to add your thoughts/experiences, thanks for reading c:

"academic advice i have decided to write a post based on my personal opinions and those of my classmates in the program as well. hihim is a little known major at uw. hihim, also known as health informatics and health information management is a cahiim accredited program that enables you to take an rhia exam after. now, into the details, when looking at their website it appears to be competitive “we only take 50 students”. 

yes, that’s great but what if only thirty apply? there are about 38-41ish people in the first year hihim classes. ok… so it’s not competitive. classes are mondays and wednesdays when they are made to sound mondays, tuesdays, wednesdays and thursdays from 5-9pm in all application materials to the major. classes are in the evenings which i am fine with, (i did apply to the program after all). classes imply learning and teaching. each class (even the five credit class!) meets one day a week for less then two hours. the five credit class meets from 7:00-8:20 and that’s it. the professor of this class has given 1 lecture in the last 6 weeks. 1 lecture. i paid 2,250 dollars (fee based program) to uw only for the professor to lecture once and have students teach each other the rest of the time.

the other professor teaches two classes, one monday and one wednesday and surprise! the wednesday class is online so i only have one class a week in person. 12 credits that i am paying 5,100 for before student and activities fees and other fees. 

this program would be better if they didn’t hype it up to be amazing only to not teach. the program has such great potential in another format and if the professors lectured. i am very lucky i am good at making myself read the textbooks and study on my own time or i would not have learned anything besides the little bits of material taught by the professors.

i will say, studying is the best way to learn but it’s one thing to teach yourself a couple concepts and entirely different thing to teach yourself for an entire quarter for three separate classes. 

the professors have you teach yourself (a good way to learn!) but never lecture (what are we paying them for?) keep in mind, hihim is a fee based bachelors program so it’s a lot more expensive then the tuition i was paying previously. 

the teachers are inconsistent with assignment formatting and have poorly made slides but expect a lot from assignments. for example, a 4-5 page paper (single spacing, no breaks after paragraphs with cover sheet and apa bibliography with a 2 paragraph summary for each source) was assigned this monday and is due this sunday. 

respect is built on trust. i feel as though i placed my trust in the hihim program and they broke that trust by hyping up the program to be great and then having it all be self taught and homework. it feels like they are making me pay them to teach myself, or alternatively i am paying them 30,000+ dollars for a two year program in which i am teaching myself and not relying on the professors to teach (their job). 

this is in no way meant to be negative, i am merely informing people about the program like i wish someone had informed me. the program has so much potential if the professors actually taught besides assigning readings and presentations for the students to give every single class”

"meeting people and partying outside of greeklife i have a really hard time meeting people in here. i consider myself very extraverted and confident, but it’s been a struggle for me and a skill i had to learn. a lot of the time people are taking classes with friends and not interested in making new ones, and speaking frankly a lot of the student body here is extremely introverted and socially awkward in general. it’s really gotten me down. i tried joining clubs but most of the clubs seem the same way too, people go with friends to do an activity and don’t talk to people they don’t know. i’ve made some friends in clubs but it’s tough because they’re activity rather than social based for the most part. there’s a couple good ones though, but many are really inactive as well as cliquish. they are also extraordinarly limited, for such an outdoorsy city it blows my mind that the winter sports clubs are the only outdoor clubs. (considering joining hws or snow club) i had a lot of interest in the sports clubs, but after tryouts the upsetting fact is that i am not athletic enough for college sports. i can workout and get in shape, but chances are by the time i am in good enough shape it will be too late. i also like partying. i know people always say “just go to house parties” but the fact of the matter is none of my non greek friends are going to parties, and most house parties tend to be a small group of close friends, which is pretty awful for meeting new people. i’ve never been invited to or seen a larger house party. i’m sure i can get invites if i keep making friends but this goes back to the original problem of uw and seattle being tough places to make friends in. the seattle club scene is a national joke unless you want to go to an lgbt club, and the bars i went to on the ave were a miserable experience. i had more fun and made more friends in the line at earls than i actually did inside earls. there’s this one frat that basically begs for guests but if you know who i am talking about you know they are good for nothing except a really good laugh. i rushed this quarter and had an awesome time. i got bids from a few fraternities with guys who’s company i really enjoyed. the fact of the matter is that it’s a huge commitment, and before making it i want to be 100% sure about the choice. are there any other alternatives to a social framework that i should take a look at? any clubs i should consider joining? i’m a hella outdoorsy guy, big on hiking, photography, backpacking, that sort of thing.

"complete guide for free (or cheap) course material going into winter quarter, a fact as old as money itself remains at uw — nobody wants to pay for something they don't have to. when looking at comically expensive textbooks, it's best to look through as many places as possible to see if you can get them for free!

this primarily covers how to get **textbook / book pdfs** but also includes a short section on **movies and tv** for classes that require watching such.

# best methods for getting free course material

1. **looking on google / reddit if someone has already asked for it!**

at large universities like uw, half the time most textbooks have already been searched for on reddit. on subreddits like r/textbookrequest (and more) individuals can receive help in their search from redditors. however, most of the time you can really just google **""\[textbook name here\] reddit""** and find a textbook pdf posted by a random redditor. i personally found my $165 spanish textbook using this method, but there are certainly other **very overpriced** uw textbooks that can be found utilizing this strategy.

2. **using an online pdf database!**

personally, i've used [https://annas-archive.org/](https://annas-archive.org/) (a comprehensive database of other pdf search sites) to find quite a bit of free pdfs for my classes — but guides such as r/freemediaheckyeah's comprehensive wiki (([linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/freemediaheckyeah/wiki/reading/#wiki_.25b7_pdf_search))) include other pdf search engines you can use! additionally, you can easily find other search tools and websites using different sub-reddits that focus on accessing free course material and literature.

*note: some books found on websites like annas-archive are provided in ""epub"" format; but you can convert epub to pdf on quite a few websites for storage on google drive. e.g:* [*https://cloudconvert.com/epub-to-pdf*](https://cloudconvert.com/epub-to-pdf)

3. **buying it used! (of course)**

this may be obvious, but buying used books (online or at the bookstore) is cheaper than buying them new. do this if you don't mind slight use and want a physical copy!

4. **using internet archive (and converting to pdf if you really want!)**

internet archive has free books that you can access and borrow! if this is the only place you can access the book for free, there's always the option of converting them to pdf so you can annotate them on google drive or preview using a pretty convoluted method that i can go into detail more about later if anyone wants to know (unfortunately it doesn't seem internet archive has an easy method to convert to pdf).

**edit: you can convert internet archive books to pdfs easily!** all you need to do is utilize this article ([article here](https://www.isolveit.xyz/2021/05/download-borrow-books-from-archiveorg.html)) which uses the software at this link ([encrypted adobe ebook to pdf software here](https://www.ebook-converter.com/drm-removal-bundle.htm)) and adobe digital editions. it has a free trial that only gives 12 book downloads, but you can probably just delete and reinstall the software if you run out (i mean i'd assume it'd reset to 12 again? probably?). so, if the book you're looking for is on internet archive (and it probably is if it's a regular book) you can use the software to convert it to pdf and get annotating! (*note: not sure how many actual textbooks are on here though*)

5. **for movies and tv for classes**

for all those needing to watch movies for a class, sometimes a teacher might suggest paying a small fee for a movie on amazon. this is certainly an option, but who wants to give more money to jeff? there are other free streaming sites shown here in a comprehensive guide: ([r/freemediaheckyeah free streaming sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/freemediaheckyeah/wiki/video/#wiki_.25ba_streaming_sites)). my personal favorite for free movies and tv is [https://moviestowatch.tv/](https://moviestowatch.tv/).

*note: always use an adblocker on these sites! a good* ***free*** ***adblocker*** *is ublock origin (*[*https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)*)*

(this is not pirating as they're on other sites that are streaming these! ""pirating"" would involve you downloading it yourself)

6. **use the library!**

if you have a book available at the library, just check it out! you can just keep renewing it as much as you need.

"why being a female is so much harder on this campus…. hi everyone. im just frustrated and needed to vent about this, but also educate my male counterparts. i’m a poc female majoring in a stem field. i’ve experienced, while at my time at uw, the constant downplaying of our observations/answers while inside of the classroom and outside. i was literally at the breaking point in one of my physics classes this week. 2 things happened in class and lab. one is that i was confused how a professor solved a certain problem, and it turns out that he had ended up solving it wrong numerically so i guess it was good i caught the mistake. my male peers, snickering behind me, also felt the need to invoice their opinions about how the professor was right etc something else too, and long story short we worked together to solve the problem. but at every stage of the problem, there was constant asking me, did you square the number to the negative power, did you do this, maybe you’re not thinking right, etc all questions they didn’t ask each other or in a very judgy way. anyways no one ended up getting to the answer. then, while in lab, my lab partner literally questions each of my lab steps in a very condescending manner. i know the difference between polite questioning and looking at someone with confused judgemental statements/eyes. i’ve been through this before, and no one should regardless of their gender or status.

i also underwent harassment and stalking by a homeless man this week who wasn’t leaving me alone until i called the police. my week has just been terrible, and it’s just so hard being a woman since we have to go through these situations in addition to trying our best to study/handle jobs. so my advice to all of the male students out there would be to be kind and work together, and stop being somewhat douch\*bag judgmental classmates, we are all at uw for a reason and have made it to our majors/academics through hardwork, regardless our gender.

edit: thank you everyone so much for sharing your experiences and for the advice! it feels better to have a community where i can discuss this. also, if you are a male i didn’t mean to say its your fault, i do know of men who try their best to include everyone, so thank you if you’re like that as well!",advice

1. i was accepted for residential program. does that mean all of my classes will be in-person, or are there still courses being offered online?
2. i was chosen for two specializations; data science and business intelligence. between the first time i applied and when i got the offer letter i had time to think, and unsure about career in ds. am i allowed to change the specializations?
3. how enjoyable are the course works, and do the amount of work balance nicely with my daily life? i'm a data analyst at uw

"doing ischool's msim program part-time? this is a follow-up to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/10jy8bn/questions_about_ischools_msim_program/):

so turns out, i applied and got accepted for the early-career track, which is expected to be full-time. in fact, the whole curriculum is designed that way, and seems to lean towards international students or students who just finished their undergrad.

i am not either of those. i have a full time job, and i read many horror stories of doing both the full-time job and full-time school. i really don't think i have the mental capacity for that sort of lifestyle.

i had an info-session with msim staffs and current students earlier today, and they told me it is not recommended to do early-career track part-time as it messes up the curriculum and the degree mapping.

now, i'd like to know if ""not recommended"" means impossible to do this. i realize this would mean a longer time to finish the course, but i'm prepared to do that if it means i get to make time management bearable. i plan on going part-time for all four quarters, which gives me around 3 years to finish.",advice
"stressed about money + commuting hi this is embarrassing but i just want to vent. i am an in-state student and have tried to do everything right in terms of finances but everything is just so expensive. at this point i'm going to graduate with at least $30k in loans and it's just so frustrating. i have a job, i've been working almost nonstop since high school, i live with my parent and commute 2.5 hours a day, i never ever eat out or buy almost anything frivolous, and i am still so broke. my parents both got laid off, i'm losing my health insurance in two months and am receiving $0 in financial aid this year.

i know i am still better off than a lot of people because i have a very safe place to live and am lucky to attend a good school but why is being alive so hard and expensive. and it feels like it's only going to get harder for the rest of my life because of inflation and the recession and whatever. i feel like all i think about all day lately is money and i look at my fellow uw students whose parents are able to pay for their really fancy apartments and stuff and i am just so jealous.

i really feel like i would be doing a lot better mentally if i could live closer to campus but i'm really scared to take on more debt. maybe i am asking for advice - is anyone else in a similar situation? how do you decide how much debt is too much? i know i am already in more debt than most people at this school and i feel like i have no concept of what kind of debt i'll actually be able to afford once i graduate and have a real job. idk",advice

"can’t handle more than two difficult classes per quarter… i’m an intended stats major, and while i’ve been able to get a very good gpa, i feel it has more to due with having an easier than average schedule that allows me to really take my time to absorb the material than anything else. the one quarter i took two very difficult weedouts and another moderately hard class, i almost failed one of the weedouts and had to drop down to 10 credits. the only quarter schedule i’ve been able juggle well is one where the third extracurricular requires almost no work (i mean this). however, i’m worried about the future. as i near my upperclassman years, i will no longer have the privilege to fill my schedule with “junk” credits and pretend i’m still fulfilling the areas of knowledge. i’ll have to start taking upper divs that are only 3 credits each, which means i’ll have to cram no less than four very conceptually difficult classes to be on track. i’m having a hard time imagining that i’ll be able to survive once the pace quickens. i’m not saying that i’m not capable of understanding the material well, i just can’t have too many things dividing my attention at once. is there any light at the end of the tunnel?",advice

"21 year old possibly autistic dude looking for someone to go on a mock date with me, will compensate weird place to do this but it is what it is. i’ve had basically no experience my whole life. i’ve been on five dates my whole life, one of which was kind of a hookup from here but it didn’t go great for either of us. i’ve had female friends, some of whom are close, but not too many i have an easy time talking to people in most contexts (struggle with parties) but i have a very small circle of close friends in general. sex and dating comes so easy for my peers, and i just don’t see what i am doing wrong. i am clean, in above average shape, very fashionable, and live a pretty interesting life with a bunch of hobby’s. there is nothing wrong with me at the surface level, but i think i have some energy underneath that makes women, and maybe also guys, uncomfortable. i suspect that i may be autistic, and that i struggle with certain kinds of social activity for a reason. i’m hoping to take a woman out on a date. we’ll just talk like people usually do and pretend we are on a date. practice flirting would be awesome, but we don’t have to and i totally understand why you might not want to. you don’t need to be an expert in psychoanalysis, i’m just hoping to hang out with someone and have them point out any bad gut feelings they get around me, or anything weird i say or do during our date.

in terms of the date, i will pay for everything. we’ll pick some place decently nice to make it worth your time. i’m thinking a non alcoholic drink of your choice and dinner. totally free in exchange for some notes about how i was to hang around. i’ve asked friends to do this for me, but the fact is, because they are my friends, they obviously have an opinion of me that is biased in my favor, otherwise they wouldn’t be friends. this is going to help me work on improving myself and my quality of life a lot more than any of you guys can realize, and i will appreciate it a ton.

to reiterate, all i am asking for you is to hang out with me and tell me how i was to be around, good and bad, in as much detail as you can, with no other expectations or strings attatched. you will get a free dinner at a place of your choosing, as well as a free non alcoholic drink like a coffee or boba. thank you in advance to anyone open to taking me up on this.",student life

"this is your end of quarter reminder: sometimes you'll get a shit grade, and that's okay! i'm posting this just because i had to get a whole ass pep talk from my mom last night about this. i did pretty terribly in highschool/running start and then quit community college for two years, but last spring i went back, started getting nothing but 4.0s, and applied to uw as a transfer. my first quarter was brutal but i managed to get a 4.0 gpa which meant a lot to me because the classes were all pre-reqs for the capacity constrained major i'm about to apply to. this quarter...has been brutal in a different way. i accidentally went four years without taking a math class (and i was already bad at math, i passed my last math class by like, 1-4%) and found out i'd need to take another math class before applying to my major. so much fun! unsurprisingly, even while putting in a lot of time and effort, i'm not doing great. 

it can be really, *really* frustrating to put so much time and effort into a class you're still not doing well in, and i know a lot of y'all might be feeling that frustration right now. it can feel like all the stress and work was for nothing, but i'm here to remind you that at the end of the day, it's fine. you're going to be fine! i know some classes are more important for our majors than others (my math class just needs a 2.0 or higher and doesn't factor in to my acceptance to my major) but regardless, one fucked up grade once in a while is not going to be the end of the world. even if you're looking to get into a capacity constrained major, grad school, or whatever, it's not going to ruin all of your plans and it doesn't say anything negative about you as a human being!

lots of uw students are, much like me, a bit neurotic about grades. at the end of every quarter i see posts like ""i got a 3.4 in this class, should i off myself? should i drop out and go work at mcdonald's until i wither away? should i go build a bunker in my backyard and live out my years there to avoid the humiliation of getting this grade?' and i think posts like that have potential to make people feel even worse about their actually low grades. even if you fail a class, you can retake it, you can adjust your plans, you can figure out something that'll make things work for you. it's not the end of the world and as long as you're putting the work in, that's what's meaningful and that's what's going to get you the place you want to be. i've accepted my fate and plugged the grades into canvas, and i'm finally at fucking peace with the fact that a 65% on my final will get me a 2.5, which is almost an entire grade point above my last grade in a math class. i'm fucking patting myself on the back for that, and you should pat yourself on the back for your hard work too!

"hfs staffing explained hello all! i've seen a lot of posts asking about the staffing problems with on-campus dining lately and i did a bit of inside research on the subject. here is what i gathered:

as many forum posts have claimed before, the union requires that hfs fill a certain number of full-time positions before giving hours to students. this is where the staffing issue comes from. there are more than enough students, but the pay that hfs offers for ft is too low to keep these positions staffed, and the school is not allowed to supplement them with pt.

tl;dr: yes, this is true.

background: currently, i work at a restaurant making almost double the base salary for retail lead at an hfs position (so in theory i have plenty of bargaining power). more specifics about their retail lead position: it is a required 40 hrs/week with no schedule flexibility, pretty basic (bare minimum imo) benefits, you don't get to choose which location (even from the ones hiring, although they do take preferences into account). at least compared to my current job, none of this is very appealing. i applied for this retail lead position to check it out and received my offer a few months ago.

starting salary is $3,260 - $3,665 ($21.14/hr) for the rl job. the starting pay for new hires (not leads, just team members) including tips at my current job is $23.75, plus schedule and location flexibility and similar benefits. i was offered the upper end of the pay scale. when i explained to hfs that this rate isn't competitive, they told me the wfse union establishes these rates and that is the highest they are allowed to offer. i then called the wfse union to confirm and the rep told me yes, unless the school is having, and i quote, ""trouble hiring people,"" they are required to only offer pay within this range. no lower, but also no higher.

so, i have no idea how the school wedged themselves into an agreement where they can't offer anything higher than a certain rate. unions are supposed to benefit employees and so it seems like somebody in this situation is being predatory to have a pay cap like this (just my theory!). however, from the representative's ""trouble hiring people"" comment, it seems to me that either hfs has not gotten the message or has not communicated the message that their students do indeed feel like they are having trouble hiring people to stay staffed.

the only thing i can think of is if everyone keep complaining! on days when half of the restaurants are closed, or when you go to the hub an hour too late to get food, make a stink about it. raise your voice (not literally at the employees duh), send hfs an email or something, i don't know.",student life

"msim 12 month eca track for sdes? i am currently an sde at microsoft, and i got admission into the msim early career accelerated track. i am looking to continue into sde roles (preferably sde2) after graduation, and i love so many things about udub. 

what’s making it hard to finalise this choice are the following 3 reasons.

1) i know thar the program is meant for data and information professionals. i have seen few people go for sde roles after this program, but want to know if it would be a very difficult path to take. for more context, i will have 3 years of work exp as an sde when i start my masters.

2) the current job market isn’t that great, so a little worried about how the situation will be in 16 months from now, which will be the time when i’ll graduate.

3) i got 2 more admits in cmu, in their mse and mism programs. but they are too expensive for me, and udub’s msim courses interested me more. having a very hard time to make a choice.

ultimately, my goal is to learn anything new related to the tech field, need not be completely technical, and land an sde role. can anyone from the program give some insights about the possibility for the above?",advice

"phys 121: purchasing e text &amp; access code to mylab &amp; mastering (💀 why are there so many options…? i’m confused 💀)

so according to the [physics 12x website](https://phys.washington.edu/121-122-123-courses), there are five options to purchase the etext and/or the access code. the access duration for online learning system varies from 18 weeks to 18 months.

this information completely differs from the payment screen on pearson. 

there are three options on the payment screen:
- option a: with e-text access with access to mastering (18 weeks) - $74.99
- option b: with e-text access with access to mastering (up to 24 months (???) ) - $124.99
- option c: without e-text access (up to 24 months (???) ) but with access to mastering - $79.99

the “up to 24 months” confuses the hell out of me because the physics 12x series website says that the access duration is 18 months… (but i digress)

i plan on taking physics 121 in the spring quarter (which is now) and physics 122 in winter quarter 2024 (which is… later (lol) ).

essentially, would i be okay in buying option c when i have a pdf copy of the textbook? i’m confused because the options only say “access to mastering” so would this include mylab and mastering??? is access to mastering referring to the hw??? will i be okay without the etext?

currently i am only taking 9 credits (math + cse course) and am worried that because this goes against the continuation policy and will somehow give me an academic warning. 

the dilemma is if i were to add another class it would have to be another cse course which would give me a really difficult course load, and if i were to add a non-cse class it would be useless as i have more than enough extra credits in these subjects.

"i got into uws (as a pre-science student) and uwb (as a pre-major student), and i want to go into cs. what should i do? with may just around the corner, i am a little concerned about the decision i'm making.

i really want to go into computer science, but, since i've been rejected from uws's cs school, i'm also considering informatics as a backup major. however, i've also been offered admission to uwb, where the cs major does not look as crazy competitive due to the smaller campus size. plus, i've already completed multiple of the prerequisites, so i might even be able to graduate early if i get into the program.

i don't know if i should struggle over informatics (which has a barely similar set of prerequisites) when i would rather go into cs. i would pick uwb immediately, but my only issue then is whether or not one program is valued over the other, and whether it would be worth pursuing a still very competitive major in something i'm not as interested in for another major in a different campus that could potentially affect my resume.

putting it all into words, my issue here is a lot more personal and complex than i thought, so let me whittle it down to this: is working for more time to attempt to get into uws's ischool (informatics program) worth more than potentially taking less time to attempt to get into uwb's csse? does it matter at all? i should probably also note that i am most definitely going to be doing stuff outside of school to help my resume.

follow up question: would staying in uws for one quarter, and then transferring to uwb if i want, be a better idea? i suppose i'm confused on where to enter into initially.

"can students transfer in outside credit courses and apply for majors?   hello, dear uw students. i am an incoming first-year student. i heard that there are only two ways for people to get credits for the prerequisite courses and use them to apply for majors. for the first method, we must take prerequisite courses for acms and cs, such as cse 123 or cse 1xx inside of uw. or we can also choose to transfer ap credits in and use them to apply for cs and acms. 

  is it so? so students are forbidden to transfer cse 123 credits from other universities and then apply for cs and acms majors? has anybody experienced this? i have taken intro to computer science at another university and it would be nicer to just transfer it in and use it to apply for cs or acms major. is this forbidden at uw?",academics

"why you might be lonely at uw hi all,

there seems to be a substantial population of lonely people here, and i wanted to give a few reasons as to why that might be.

1. quarter system. people are busy, and it's a nonstop barrage of exams and assignments. on top of caring about grades, everyone around you is trying to pile on extracurriculars. there is a relatively high turnover of new people that you will meet between classes.
2. it's a big school. you have to put in more effort to meet up with somebody, and it's easier to avoid someone or get lost in the crowd.
3. cliques. uw has a few surrounding feeder schools and california students, so people stick to what they know.
4. you're in a major with a higher workload. related to point 1, but if you're doing labs all day it can be harder to find someone you like.

i left out the freeze because it depends on who you talk to, but people around here are friendly. this isn't to say that there are some things that you as an individual can't improve, but i would consider the above to be decent obstacles to making friends. there are folks that do like you for you.

"🐺 tired of walking through cherry blossom tourists? join husky flying club and learn how to fly a literal airplane over them! | 🎮drones | 🛠️ aircraft build | 🖥️ flight sims | ✈️ real-life aviation | join husky flying club! howdy r/udub,

you may have seen or spoken to us at new student admittance day recently, but here's a recap on our club dedicated to **giving huskies wings & breaking down socioeconomic barriers that come with participating in aviation**.

we are **husky flying club**, an rso on campus dedicated to **anything aviation-related**. we have grown exponentially in the past couple of years, now with four major components of our club:

* 🎮 our **competitive fpv (first person view) drone racing team** which meets regularly and hones their flying skills.
* **🖥️ hangar 51**, a dedicated space for **extremely advanced hotas and virtual reality equipped flight simulators** which all have dcs (digital combat simulator) with an attached club squadron that faces off against other schools around the country in dogfights, bvr (beyond visual range) engagements, and mission scenarios. the sims also have microsoft flight simulator 2020.
* 🛠️ the **aircraft build team**, a student-led initiative to build an airplane (the rv-12is) which upon completion will be used for research in future graduate-level programs! a variety of ""toolbox teams"" meet regularly to work on various parts of the aircraft.
* **🏫 free ground school** taught by a cfi (certified flight instructor) who is committed to taking you into the skies at the lowest possible cost!

🖥️ hangar 51:

hangar 51 is husky flying club's own flight simulation room located on the top floor of clark hall. the room is equipped with **3 vr-capable flight simulators**. the simulators have both **dcs (digital combat simulator)** and **microsoft flight simulator 2020** installed and ready to play. there is also an faa-approved redbird flight simulator that you can use to earn 5 flight hours with one of our cfis! our club has dedicated instructors who are excited to coach newcomers on how to fly, whether they have zero experience or plenty of real-life flight time. additionally, multiplayer coast-to-coast events are held which feature combat pvp **campaigns/scenarios**! husky flying club members **are able to access the room whenever they schedule it out** as long as they attend enough meetings. newcomers must have an instructor or existing member with them to access the room outside of meetings. if you have your own sim setup, you are free to join our dedicated server during meeting times!

&#x200b;

🎮 drone team:

fpv drone racing is a competitive sport where drone pilots wear ar-goggles to race drones from a first-person perspective. these racing drones can go upwards of 60 miles per hour! racing courses consist of a series of obstacles that the drone must navigate through, with the pilot having the fastest lap time winning. we encourage our pilots to use the drone simulators in clark hall whenever they want. outside of racing, our drone team will provide many opportunities for **developing your skills in engineering (nice for your resume**). assembly of drones requires detailed soldering, testing, and shop skills.

&#x200b;

🛠️ aircraft build: in case you also did not know, our club is building the **very first light sport aircraft** on campus (rv-12is)! this is an extremely unique and lucrative project to be involved in and looks great on a resume to practically any engineering-involved company, especially boeing! while this opportunity is full for the quarter, this summer we will still be working on it and planning our projects for this year. all huskies are welcomed into our space at the mech e building during this time!

&#x200b;

🏫 free ground school: mondays on our discord server feature virtual lessons taught by a certified cfi. these lessons, sponsored by emerald squadron aviation llc, are free in our club so long as you are a husky student and have a discord account. if you consistently do well enough in the course, our cfi will sponsor you to take the written knowledge test. this is huge towards gaining your private or recreational pilot's license, considering such lessons are typically hundreds of dollars at local flight schools.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

outside of our drone racing team and flight simulators, husky flying club places a big emphasis on **building connections between our members and people in the aviation industry.**  our club holds “aviation talks”, social qna sessions where we bring  people from the aviation industry such as pilots or engineers to talk to  our members. in addition, we are working toward getting our members who  have zero flight experience some time in the air with actual pilots from the local civil air patrol.

"dropping below 12 credits at the end of the quarter while on financial aid ?? hi friends, i have a question. 

at the end of last quarter, i met with my  academic advisor who told me that if i took only 10 credits this spring quarter, my financial aid would be fine because i’d still be completing 36 credits over the whole academic year. well, turns out she has no fuckin idea what she’s talking about, because at the beginning of this quarter, my financial aid did not disburse because i wasn’t registered for at least 12 credits. i told the financial aid office what my advisor said, and they were like yeah no that’s not how it works. so i added a random 3-credit envh class that i haven’t gone to once. 

at the same meeting (which was during week 9 of winter quarter), my advisor told me to drop a 3-credit class i was definitely going to get an ns in (long story but i promise i’m not just lazy). again, she said it would be be fine because i’d still be completing 36 credits over the whole year. so i dropped it in week 9 and thus fell to 10 credits. again, turns out she’s dead wrong, but i never heard anything about it from the financial aid office.    

so my current dilemma - i really really need to drop this envh class. but i’m worried that i just got lucky last quarter or that they haven’t noticed yet, and that if i drop below 12 credits again i’ll have to repay my financial aid or something. 

does anyone know anything about any of this? if you drop below 12 credits at the end of the quarter, do they not care? any advice would be a huge help. thank you :)",advice

"info/business double degree -- is it doable? incoming uw student here, admitted directly to info for fall 2023. i have yet to talk to an academic advisor, but i just wanted to hear fellow students (or alumni) thoughts on achieving a double degree in informatics and business.

also, here is some quick information to avoid more generic answers:

* 10 ap classes, intending to use probably 5 to fulfill mostly ssc and nsc requirements and stay as close to 225-230 credits as possible by graduation.
* i would absolutely love to do summer abroad, but i'm not sure when.
* no running start credit :-(
* interested in getting an mba, although plans can always change down the road!

i made a spreadsheet for myself showing every class i need to take to get both degrees at the same time after four years at the uw. after spending a couple of hours simulating a couple of schedules, i found the most financial-savvy way to do both degrees is by doing 18 credits most quarters plus a summer quarter to stay afloat, which i know would be exhausting and stressful.

i like to consider myself hardworking and excited about learning, but i want to avoid a declining mental health and overworking myself to burnout. i am thinking of knocking out a couple of prereqs for business this summer and possibly doing a summer quarter 2024 (so that i can apply for winter quarter 2025 during my sophomore year) to ease the burden, but do you guys have any other thoughts on how achievable this double degree is?",academics

"subleasing 3 individual bedrooms in u district apartment hey y'all! my 2 roommates and i are trying to sublease for the summer (starting now until end of september 2023), but you don't need a group of 3 people - just 1 person can sublease a single bedroom, 2 people can lease 2 bedrooms, etc. 

rent is $1349 per person per month, which includes all utilities (sewer, garbage, water, electricity, internet). i'm personally willing to negotiate the rent price if you want to rent out a single bedroom, so message me and we can talk about figuring out something that works! the complex also has study rooms, a gym, a sauna, and a rooftop deck with mini-kitchen and grills, all of which are included amenities. the apartment is on brooklyn and 50th; the walk time to the burke edge of campus is 5-10 minutes, depending on how fast you walk.

i will say - the apartment complex is here seattle, which, if you've heard anything about, is rather notorious for its shitty management. having lived here for about a year, i'll say that most of the general qualms with the complex aren't actually about the apartment (which, to be honest, is pretty damn nice), but more about the management's delay of the apartment opening (our move-in was delayed by, like, 3 months). so, if you're subleasing, you don't have to deal with any of that shit, and you just get to move into the apartment on time like a normal person lol. also, to be so honest, management right now is pretty chill. i think most of the front desk workers are uw students, and they never check on your apartment. so, not bad. the apartment itself is very nice (our kitchen has massive counterspace lol).

anyways, message me if you're interested and/or want pictures! like i said, i'm personally willing to negotiate the rent price, because frankly, paying less on my rent in an apartment i won't be in over the summer is better than paying the full rent. also willing to tour for those in the area, or record a video tour for interested parties, so just lmk!",student life

"reflection from a jaded senior (gatekeeping culture at uw) because every facet of uw is competitive (major admissions, internships, jobs), most students gatekeep their resources and misrepresent their stats. i’ve often seen fellow students and even friends gatekeep their network, internships, resources. as a result, it’s extremely hard for someone without network to even know where to begin looking for internships and get their foot in the door. i especially feel this as a first gen immigrant, as my parents can only nod and smile when i tell them about school or my internship. as much as people don’t want to believe it or laugh at it, but privilege also comes from having well connected parents (or even parents who know about how the american society works). this is where i sound cynical, but it really is true when people joke that someone can make a call to their dad or their dads friend and get an internship. i saw a video where there is soft nepotism (or something along those lines), where young people benefit from having parents in the same industry as them. i see my peers having their hands held through the recruiting process because they have parents in that industry. 

looking back, i want to stress the importance of network to incoming students. resources are distributed widely in professional rsos and frats/sororities (which also require quite competitive applications but that’s another can of worms) but tightly restricted within those social circles, so make sure you are leveraging these networks.

edit: this post exists to reflect on my experiences and offer a word of advice to younger students. yes, this was my dream school, but because of that i came in with rose tinted glass thinking that as long as i do well (get into a good major, get good grades, get into good clubs) i will be recognized by the real world and be rewarded with a good job. however, i was unaware of the fact that networking is such an important factor in addition to doing well academically, and sometimes even trumps academic achievement. for those that have had similar experiences, i feel seen and i am glad we can all recognize the bigger issue. yet i want to make it clear that i am not looking for sympathy, but to offer perspectives that i wish someone would have told me coming into college. i write this post partially to also let younger students know that academic achievement isn’t all and it’s better to start building connections, especially if they didn’t realize that network is important or what networking even is (as i was when i started college). 

secondly, i admit that yes, i perhaps could’ve done better and shot for the stars. i am not giving myself any excuses, as many in the comments think i am doing. this isn’t a pity party, and i am not blaming other hardworking people for “taking things away from me”. my criticism is on the system where some people who have low, no experience, etc, can get a job because their parents have connection.

lastly, some comments seem to rely on confirmation bias when evaluating the information in this post. more dangerously, making assumptions in the name of “tough love”. just because i shed light on some less-than-peachy aspects of uw does not mean i have no connections or relationships. i have a job, friends, and i am full of hope. i am simply recognizing the fact that to get here, it took me a lot of extra work.",advice

hi guys! it has been a month since i last posted here, and i was overwhelmed by the personal experience, support, and advices i got from current uw students. you guys were all brutally honest about your experience, and i just want to say thank you, i genuinely appreciate each and every comment on that post.

today, saturday, may 27th, 2023, i have decided to decline uw pre-science offer and committed to my local community college, and will test my luck again with the uw cs transfer admission cycle.

as a lot of you have said, the true ""college experience"" is what you make it to be. i might be missing out on the ""traditional college experience"", the freshmen dorming experience, the parties, the late night studies at odegaard, the walks with friends on uw red square, etc, but i'm sure that i will gain a lot of meaningful experience at my local cc!

for the anxious high school students that are reading this, there is no right or wrong option, college admission is random sometimes (i'm an instate student waitlisted by uw but accepted by ucla, ga tech, uiuc and just got off uc berkeley waitlist). don't be disheartened by setbacks or waitlists; sometimes, life has a way of working things out in unexpected ways.

as for now, uw is still at the top of my transfer list and i hope that my journey at the community college will be fruitful and lead me back to uw in the future.

good luck to all the prospective, current, and graduated uw students, and to anyone navigating the college admissions process. i hope my story can provide some guidance and reassurance to others facing a similar dilemma. may your journeys be filled with growth, learning, and success.",advice

the problem is, without financial aid i will not be able to attend without financial aid. since almost every freshman going to uw already confirmed their admission, do you think i have any chance of getting “good” financial aid? is it even worth it to contact the office?

my other problem is that for some reason i got marked as an out of state applicant even though i live in washington, which means higher tuition, which means i also need more financial aid. 

i was already planning on going to community college, so if i end up having to do that because of the cost/being marked as out of state i wouldn’t be so mad but would i even be able to get in again if i decide to go to community college instead of uw? would i get “blacklisted” if i reject my admission? also, does anyone know if i can transfer after just one year or do i have to do two years of cc before transferring?

"want to transfer to uw from bellevue college hey guys, so i'm currently a bellevue college student and i am interested in applying to uw for the nutritional sciences program (food systems major). at the end of this quarter i will have my 90 credits (and technically an aa-dta), i have a 4.0 gpa, am in the ptk honors society, and am president of a new club. i have also held a part-time job for the past 2 years during cc (one year was running start). however i have 3 more classes (minimum) that i'd have to take to be able to apply for the major due to this not being my original plan when starting cc, so my planning wasn't perfect, which i plan on taking during bc's fall quarter. this means i'd plan to transfer to uw starting in the winter quarter. i'm mostly wondering about my chances of getting accepted to uw assuming i maintain all of the previously mentioned things during the fall quarter (although the deadline to apply for winter is actually before bc fall quarter starts so i don't know if that would even matter). do you think i'd need more extracurriculars? some options i could look into for those are tutoring at bc or applying to the school newspaper to potentially write nutrition related articles, volunteering at food banks, etc. but i've seen some people say extracurriculars weren't really important. i've also gathered that the personal essay is one of the most important things. and i know that uw really likes cc transfer students from in state so that would probably make my chances higher. just wondering what my chances are.

i also met with an advisor from the school of public health today as well and she mentioned that the food systems major is also a minimum requirement major and that if i met the minimum requirements that i would pretty much be guaranteed to get into the major. i've seen some other people talking about how they got accepted into the specific school/major before they actually got accepted into uw (general admission i guess(?)). so i'm wondering if that is something you can do? i'm not entirely sure i understand all that lol

another thing is that depending on if i choose to take one bio class fall quarter or the entire gen bio series at bc (which would take another year), either of those paths would transfer to give me the 5 credits needed for the major at uw, it just depends on what would be best for my goals after graduation, and i'm speaking with a nutrition advisor soon to figure out what bio path would be best. basically i'd either transfer for the next winter quarter, or if i take more bio classes i'd transfer to the autumn quarter of 2024. waiting another year and taking more bio classes could give me a chance to get more extracurriculars however i've also heard that uw doesn't like it when you take more than 2 years to complete an associates (but i already have my associates so maybe it's ok?), and then just taking the one bio class and applying for winter quarter would be nice because its sooner, but then everything is a bit tighter. looking for opinions on that stuff i guess.

"hello, guys, desperately need some of your help here. i am so stuck. hello, everyone. it is surely a pleasure and honor to be able to join this vibrant community of uw but i am now experiencing some troubles here. i am intl student and i am now having some daunting troubles of getting my visa to study at uw. i wrote this email to the iss office in the hope to receive some help from them. for me, joining uw is sort of like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. also, it could be just my affection for every aspect and bit of this community which propels me to never give away my endeavors to work towards physically arriving here. i genuinely hope that you could take several minutes to read my story and possibly offer me some help or advice on my situation. i included details in the letter below:

dear officers at uw iss,

greetings. i really hope that you could read my following words and consider them carefully, as it is absolutely something that directly pours out of a student who is now working desperately hard to get to uw and start his academic journey. as previously mentioned, my background is very different from most other students from uw and it could be something that affects my visa application. i applied for a student visa in beijing, china today but unfortunately got rejected. i discussed the situation on my visa application form(ds160) about how i tried to overcome the bullying issues, which were seriously hindering my education and have cost me several years out of school, creating a gap in my education. but it seems that the visa officer did not read it in full detail at all(maybe because it was kind of long) and did not acknowledge my situation. it is likely that they only thought about the fact that i am older than other ordinary students and just rejected me, assuming that i have ***immigration intent*** because i am attending college at my current age. they may have concerns that i would overstay/work illegally once i got the visa.

but it is not the truth, bullying is nothing that should be considered my fault and i suffered a lot from the situation. i have seen quite a lot of people with similar situations never be able to rise up from the abyss where they were struggling. but god knows how i managed to overcome those exceedingly insurmountable obstacles and managed to come back from that. i think it is the innate determination that has pushed me finally to this stage of life. it is funny that the bullies and everyone else from my previous school here in china never made it to uw or other similarly prestigious universities. 

after i was forced out of school because of these incidents, i almost never ceased learning everything i had at hand. i have been so desperately working hard to absorb every bit of knowledge that i have in my sight. i have come back from that abyss where a significant number of people were crashed, hammered, and scattered in pieces and i do not want this to affect my hard-earned opportunities anymore. i want to go to uw without being accused of having immigration intent and being older than other students. i hope everything i worked up will eventually pay off for me and i know i am well worth it. i promise i will work hard amongst the top determined students you have ever seen in your career and i hope i can have a chance to make you and uw proud! i have come back from a student who did not know how to cope when forced out of a chinese middle school to someone that finds his way to finish four years of u.s. high school in one year and successfully send himself to college. i want to keep being a miracle worker! i love uw and desperately want to come!

sincerely, may i please have some assistance regarding my visa application from uw? today, i was rejected by an officer in the u.s. embassy in beijing, likely due to my previous visa rejections when going to a community college(i wanted to transfer to a 4-year university from a cc first) and the fact i am older than other undergraduate college students, which means i am 26 years old now. could you please offer me some guidance and assistance regarding my unique situation? i really want to nail this visa application and successfully come to uw. any help would be highly appreciated!",advice

"uw vs. uo? i hate to be redundant with all of the other ""why udub?"" posts, but i'm beginning to reach a level of indecisiveness that i'm desperate. i just got off of the waitlist for the university of washington—seattle last saturday, so i'm checking out the campus for a second time before i make the final decision by june 10.

uw was my top, top choice when i was applying to colleges originally, but once i was waitlisted, i had to accept that my admission was not guaranteed and opt for something else... after lots of comparing and contrasting, i fell in love with the uo. i was admitted into their honor's college, and the marching band was a definite. housing is guaranteed with a good system for connecting with potential roommates, so it feels like i've got everything in place over there. however, while the marching band and the honors program are no longer guaranteed at uw, i know that the school has a prestige that may be kind of stupid for me to pass up. i'll be a psychology undergrad, but i still feel like the rigor and quality of education are important to me. i'm also from nyc, so seattle's more urban environment that is meant to accommodate a big city rather than just college students feels more familiar than eugene.

the costs of both schools are pretty comparable, as i'll be paying out-of-state tuition for both. when i look for honest opinions online, i solely see overwhelmingly positive or drastically negative responses. i realize that i'm asking one of the uo's top athletic rivals, but i'm just waiting to sign the dotted line and am curious about others' opinions.",advice

i’m a recently admitted student in the masters of applied bioengineering program here at uw, and i want to secure housing before i quit my job. i’ve tried joining the uw facebook housing but am waiting to be let in. i was wondering around how long should i wait.

"on-campus vs. off-campus housing for the following year? i've lived in both dorms and on-campus apartments in the past year, and i have been planning to stay in an off-campus apartment (the accolade) for the upcoming 2023-2024 school year that is very close to some of the dorms and has a good reputation. however, over the last few days, i have debated whether to stay in this apartment or opt in and stay in the dorms.

&#x200b;

i know that for sure, if i wanted a dorm, then i would prefer either a double room or a single room in any of the modern dorms (alder, lander, maple, poplar, elm, terry, oak, willow, madrona, mccarty), with a strong preference in willow or terry (only because i have friends living in those halls next year as residents and ras). however, if i get a roommate, it will likely become a random roommate, and i am not sure how exactly things will play out in that scenario. when i was staying with hfs this past year, i had two scenarios where i was with two random roommates for about three weeks in a triple dorm (alder) and then with one preferred and two random roommates for the next nine months in an on-campus apartment (mercer court). i would have my own bedroom in my off-campus apartment but would be sharing a living space with two preferred roommates and one random roommate.

&#x200b;

now, i know i can manage and make do with a dorm scenario. i will be on the lookout for roommates if that's what i end up with, but the main reason why i would be looking to stay on campus is because of the amount of space i could have in a dorm room versus the amount of space i could have in the bedroom of my off-campus apartment. i plan to bring a couple of instruments with me this coming year since i am a musician, and i am worried that i will not have any space to keep them if i stay off-campus in my bedroom compared to the space i could have for it in the dorms. i obviously would also like to have some space for working (desk space) and some storage since i am out of state and will have some boxes and suitcases with all my other stuff.

&#x200b;

has anyone been in a similar situation as me? what advice would you all give someone in such a situation? if i decide to change my housing to on-campus from off-campus, what are the chances that i will be able to get the kind of room and hall i want?",advice
"parking citations hope you guys are doing well and congrats on all the new grads! however i am doing kind of doo doo shit. i recently got a ticket for parking without a permit (it was my own fault; i have appealed it since i parked in a lot for about 20 minutes to go pick up an item i'd lost, so hoping to get a smaller fine). i went to pay online and found out i had two long overdue tickets that i never got on my car. i'd never seen another ticket in my life. i'm staring at a fat fee that i have no recollection of. 

my guess is someone else in the family drove it there without me knowing since i let siblings borrow it when they need to. the issue is they never mentioned a ticket, and if they hid it from me that's a whole other issue. is there a way i can appeal this or do i just take the l and pay, which i assume is the only way out?",advice

"unsure, need answers and advice i'm applied for transfer to uw from a wa cc and got admitted to the pre-science major. to me this sounds like a good opportunity to explore other options aside from cs (yes lol i got rejected and it kinda discouraged me).

i'm now looking at hcde or info. my question is i guess whether or not is it a viable route to traverse or should i just take an offer from another university that gives me dtm for that major? going to uw seattle would be rad though, and i'd say i'm willing to take any advice i could get if this is something i could accomplish.

"any molecular cellular biology grad students? or genome sciences? hi all!

i’m applying to grad programs this fall. im graduating in 2 months from ohio state university, and my major was in fisheries science. however, we do some work with fish  genetics in my lab (undergrad research) and i also did some genetics coursework that made me super interested in genetics. i’ve done 2.5 years of undergrad research (30 hrs a week) and i’m also defending my undergrad thesis in a month. so i’m no stranger to hard work! but i know grad school is crazy.

i was thinking about applying to genetics grad programs. can any current grad students give me any insight? could i catch up having done minimal genetics coursework? i don’t want to get in over my head.

some more background, i didn’t exclusively take fish classes since i was in the honors program which allowed me a lot of flexibility in my courses. so i took things like genetics, physiology, anatomy… but i still feel like i’d be really behind y’all who did genetics undergrads.

also any insight into grad student culture in this area? any advice at all? haha i know it’s vague but i’d really appreciate anything at all!

sincerely,

a nervous applicant",advice

"needing some suggestions that can help me finally make it to uw... hello, fellow uw students. first, congratulations to those who just graduated this year! well done, and hope everything can go well in whatever lies ahead in your future. and i hope that everybody who just finished their finals is doing great. have a wonderful summer vacation.

as for me, i really hope that i can receive some advice about my coping strategies during my visa interview. as mentioned in my previous post, i encountered school bullying in my country over 10 years ago. i got seriously affected by that so there basically was no means for me to carry on my study in my middle school then. 

luckily, through my resilience and determination along the path, over time i gradually recovered from that situation and made it to colleges, in a country that is considered foreign to me. so basically i succeeded in making it through, although i basically have to teach myself everything to prepare myself for college, after i was out of that middle school in my country. 

but as my education took a huge hit from the incident, it was significantly delayed and i had to face going to school at a relatively older age, like i had to do it when i am 26. this is gonna be a huge con when applying for a student visa, they suspect you will misuse your visa for immigration or sth illegal. 

i know that i need to explain everything in the interview(i have been rejected once). i really hope that maybe you guys can provide me with some feedback about my interview strategy, it is gonna be so helpful and i wanna see if my words are concise and persuasive enough. i posted my strategy in the comment.

my husband and i are trying to decide what to do when we start going to grad school at uw. we want to live closer to campus. i've heard it's hard to get family housing on campus but what's your experience? 

so far we have considered the following options:

· selling our home and buying something closer to campus
· renting out our home with any combination of the below options
· student housing
· renting
· sub leasing

we currently live in kirkland and the drive has gotten crazy. plus i am disabled and being able to take the bus or ride a scooter to classes will be a huge plus. i hate having to deal with parking and then parking being so far away! on top of it being expensive. 

we love our house in kirkland because it has a backyard. we are kind of leaning towards renting our house out to someone we know but then renting near campus will be just an extra expense. plus i am very sentimental about the house now as my cat was just diagnosed with cancer.  🥺 she's made her mark (literally) on the house. and we bought a house with a backyard specifically so our cats can hang out with us while we garden.

just today i registered for esrm 250, my instructor is johnathan lamont batchelor, resulting in me having 17 credits and about 14 hours and 40 minutes worth of lectures/quizes per week. 

does anyone know what the course is like? i’m already taking a fig, math 125 and esrm 200, is esrm 250 too much to handle? how difficult is the class and how many hours would i need to spend outside of class studying for it? should i just drop the class for next quarter and do 12 credits foe the autumn 2023 quarter?

"chem sequences for pre-nursing hi! i’m an incoming freshman with a pre-nursing major.

i tested into chem 145 but read for bsn prereqs that chem 120/220/221 is the best for pre-nursing students. 

i emailed the nursing admissions team and they said i could take 152 after 145 and also an ochem course. dug around, found that ochem 237 appeared the best fit for taking chem 145, but the pre-reqs for it are chem 153/155/162.  

i emailed asking if i could take general chemistry 145+155 + ochem 237 to complete my chemistry pre-reqs. (haven’t gotten a response yet.)
 
however, i also just read about how honors chem is so much harder. is it really worth it? will taking harder chem courses add to my bsn application, or should i just drop and register for the reg chem classes? i’d love hearing advice/y'all's experiences!

"aa engineering undergrad to physics phd i've really liked being an aa undergrad, but from the time i've gotten to spend working in industry as an intern, i've realized that i'm not going to be happy if the rest of my career is nothing but excel engineering and mind numbing webex meetings. what i really wanted to do with my career before realizing it was a financial non-starter was to be a physicist (hopefully going the astrophysics/particle physics route). i love space though, so aerospace seemed like the next best thing, especially if i got to do more hands-on work (which hasn't been the case so far). i keep finding myself looking at all of the great classes in the physics department on myplan though, and it's gotten a bit depressing realizing i won't be able to take them going into my last year of undergrad. i'd do a master's, but most of the time uw will not cover costs, and i'd have a hard time affording it on my own (parents only paying 1/2 of 3 years of undergrad). has anyone here had any experience with applying to a graduate physics program after completing an engineering bachelor's?",academics

"uw materials science vs cu boulder aerospace  hello,

i'm reaching out on here in hopes that someone would be able to guide me and help me make a decision. i was admitted into uw's materials science program (my home state) but rejected from their aerospace program and received my admission into boulder's aerospace program a bit ago.

for some background, i have always wanted to go into the aerospace field since i was young. i've received internship offers with boeing, interned at an og aerospace company, and had been involved in my school's rocketry team. i want to pursue a career in electric propulsion systems and eventually want to get a graduate degree.

i have financial aid for uw since i was a previous student and had some scholarships racked up. i'm taking a materials science class as a prerequisite right now and am not a huge fan. if i decide to commit to cu boulder, that would mean leaving my family here and having to move in less than a month.

i guess i'm just stuck with my 2 options:

1. uw materials science

pros: in-state, decent financial aid, close to family and friends, minor in aerospace

cons: not the major i ideally want, worried about lack of access to opportunities post-grad

2) cu boulder aerospace

pros: major that interests me, no worry about the types of post-grad opportunities

cons: out of state, more expensive",advice

"moving into an apartment (nordheim court) for the first time, what essentials should i make sure to have when i move? hello! so i'm a master's student looking to move into nordheim this fall, if all goes well. 

now before i do, i wanted to ask a few questions about the apartment i'd be moving into and stuff related to that. i've never lived alone before, or in a central us city, so pardon me if any of my questions are dumb or anything lol.

so first, what are the most important things i should bring before moving onto campus, vs stuff i can buy later? my current list is: 

bed sets (idk if it should be twin xl or full but i'll see), pillows, basic toiletries, towels + washcloths, dishes and cutlery (like a pair of everything), clothes ofc, an umbrella(?), clothing iron?? some small pots and pans, some spices and rice and ramen, maybe an airfryer/toaster??? idk this feels like a lot but i'm also worried i'm missing stuff too.

also, do the apartments come with kettles at least, or literally anything else i can leave out? i'm already spending a lot to get a whole new wardrobe to move into a cold and rainy climate, along with all the other stuff, so i kinda want to keep it at a minimum cost 😭

ooh also, where do people get good rain coats/shoes that maybe don't cost over $100-$150 per piece? the cheaper the better tbh, but anything that works and can last a year is good!

next, how many cheap food+grocery options are there nearby lmao, it seems like everything good is on the ave 😭. does anyone go to costco from campus? is it worth it to go that far on public transport? and since i'm south asian, do the grocery stores hold any south asian food items (or are there any indian/pakistani stores nearby)? 

what about travel from the airport? i see most people take the lightrail, but is it easy with luggage? especially if you have at least 2 suitcases? 

and lastly, side question(s), how is it like living in nordheim court? is it quiet-ish? is there anything i should know/be wary of before moving in? and i've read the walk to campus is kinda uphill, but how bad is it? if i want to catch a bus that isn't full, what time should i aim to leave?

sorry for the super long post, feel free to leave out as many questions as you want. thanks for reading this thoughhhh!! (also my post gets deleted every time i try to post it here but hopefully it won't this time 😭)",advice

in my 1st year i took only 1 intro class per quarter (bio 18o + chem 142 and 152) and i developed a pretty good study strategy that helped me get a 4.0 on all my classes. for example doing a dummy load of practice problems to really get the concepts done. i looked at some practice exams for bio and phys and i feel like it might be manageable if i do the same routine of doing more practice exams than memorization.

in the meantime, anybody have any other possible solutions to consider? i took the language placement test and have japanese experience when i took just one course, although was still eligible for japn101. maybe i should look into community college instead? i’m genuinely not too sure what to do. i contacted the academic advisors and they said they will help me but it’s just me in limbo for now. yes, i probably am very entitled. but this is my graduation requirement we are talking about! i need full four years of japanese and now i just may have to take it for five years instead. i apologize for my passion in the previous paragraphs, but please, bare with me.",advice

"applying to grad school with little experience? hi!

uw psych grad school applications open on september 1st, and i’ve been panicking…a lot. i’m entering my senior year here, and i got into the psych major last year, on the b.s. track. since then, i’ve completed almost all pre-reqs. i just have statistics, one or two electives, and labs to complete. however, this also includes psych 499. 

psych 499 is undergrad psychological research and it’s required for the b.s. track. all summer, i’ve been applying to research/reaching out to faculty to get credit for this course, but nothing has really solidified. i need research experience to graduate, but also, i feel like it would come in handy on my grad school application.

i joined the huskies@work program, and was matched with the most amazing mentor who taught me so much about the psych graduate program at uw. since then, i’ve been really considering a gap year before applying to grad school, but i’m not sure. i want to go on the clinical route and work in neuropsychology, but to apply, i feel like i need to get experience in. at the moment, i really don’t have clinical or research experience. with the application opening up soon, i feel like i should apply, but i also feel like the chances of me getting in are quite low with my lack of experience. i have a competitive gpa, and experience working and volunteering, but nothing specifically psych related.

i wanted to post on here to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience, or if any grad students have advice. should i apply to uw and risk being turned down (but maybe i’ll get in?), or should i take a gap year? i also plan to apply to other schools, but uw is my dream grad school. i just want to ask what others think. thank you :)

i have been in correspondence with the office for 2 months now and i'm wondering what next steps i can take to get my 500 dollars back, being physically outside the us. what other departments of uw can i go to to get help? should i contact the study abroad office to see if they have experience helping exchange students?

i am confused why my scholarship was cut down if i'm getting money given back anyways. i asked the finaid office (uw tacoma) but was told that it was because of my need already being met by the grants. if that's why, then why are they still giving me $900 back?

"bus etiquette with things picking up around campus and classes starting tomorrow (good luck everyone, you've got this!), i've noticed a lot of unseasoned public transit users, to put it bluntly. overall riding the buses is pretty straightforward, but there's quite a few things that make the experience easier for everyone.

* make sure you tap your husky card when you board! most buses have the card reader at the front, but some bus models (namely the rapidride) have a card reader by the back doors to expedite the process. tapping on is very important for the metro services to gauge route popularity, which can lead to more frequent buses in the future! (it's also already paid for via your tuition, so take advantage of it!)
* remember to pull the cord by the windows when you want to get off at the next stop (it's usually yellow or silver). there's also a red ""stop"" button on the pole next to the back door that can be pressed for the same reason. the drivers only stop at bus stops if someone requests to get off or to pick up passengers, so don't assume the bus will stop unless you pull the cord!
* when someone requests to stop, there's an indicator for that. some buses have a red light that lights up above the destination sign (the marquee at the front of the bus that shows the time/route number or the next stop; i had to look it up to see what it's actually called lol), while others just go back and forth between the next stop and ""stop requested.""
* if the bus is relatively empty it's totally fine to sit in the aisle seat or place your bag in the aisle seat, but when the bus starts to become crowded, please scoot over or move your bag so someone can sit next to you. i usually hold mine or set it at my feet.
* if you see an empty seat, take it! sitting next to strangers may take a bit to get used to, and obviously use your best judgment when sitting next to a stranger, but it's really important to make room in the bus for more passengers. nothing is worse than a ""full bus"" that's only full because people don't want to sit next to others.
* when it's standing room only, *please move all the way to the back of the bus*. not to the steps in front of the back door, up the steps and *all the way to the back*. the bus can fit at least 5 more people on it when people go all the way to the back. there are many poles and hand straps you can use to hold on to.
* say thank you to your bus drivers! they have a hard but extremely important job and don't get paid enough :)

these are obviously just the basics, and each line is a little different, but these are some things i've noticed on the lines that go straight to campus.

happy riding, and good luck this quarter :) ",advice
"tips and what not as a recent uw grad, here are some tips for incoming freshmen!   


* sometimes they give out free stuff in front of the hub from clubs or whatever. there's also occasionally food trucks there like bbq and what not. if you have time, def take a stroll. i was given laundry detergent by the sustainability club once it was cool but i forgot the name of it
* everybody needs to go to the bathroom for a #2 at some point. explore campus and see which bathroom gives you the maximum comfort for blowing up the toilet without the embarrassment
* the starbucks line at suzello is always so long and there's no order ahead. might as well as do order ahead for the starbucks on the ave and go pick it up
* join clubs if you can! you can always quit, its not a cult. you might find it fun. one of my regret is not being in a club
* if you wanna do research, start emailing profs early. don't overthink, just type up a short intro, attach resume, state motivation, and hit send. 
* if ur on a budget, sizzles and crunch has protein packed salad/rice bowls and its usually large enough you can split it between lunch and dinner
* if you go to the business building(s), them rich mfs are always holding some kind of event and it comes with free food/lunch. so watch for that. also good place to study and nap. 
* there are therapy dogs but the lines are long asf. not worth it.
* burke museum is free, go visit with friends

i am a biochem major who needs to take chem 452 and 453. i was signed up for the course with professor gary drobny, and he seems very charismatic and friendly. however, his lectures go at 100mph and are hard to follow even though i am confident in my calculus abilities and read the slides beforehand. i also felt as though the topics do not apply to biochemistry as much as i hoped, and it feels just like a more advanced physics course (pistons, springs, etc). we were supposed to have our first quiz this friday, and we have not gone over any problems in lecture and the homework is very tedious. because of this and my 17 (science) credit workload and financial aid discrepancies, i ended up dropping the class to take it at a later time. my questions are as follows: who is the best professor to take this course with? i would not mind taking professor drobny again if needed, but i am open to other suggestions. also, is the 452/453 a/b summer option a doable thing? i have heard people mention the final (especially drobny's) is particularly brutal in that sequence. not looking forward to taking the series at all, but i understand it is inevitable.

tl,dr: who is the best professor to take for chem 452/453 and when should i take them?

thank you all, and go dawgs!",academics

"what's been your strategy for getting to know professors/identifying who might be a good option for a letter of recommendation? i had a somewhat weird time in college; i did running start for two years in highschool, stopped college for about a year and a half, finished my associates through community college (online classes cuz covid) and then transferred as a junior last fall. i started my major over the summer and am on track to finish by spring 2024. i didn't have many opportunities to get to know many of my professors, and i was also super anxious about showing up to office hours without any real topic i needed to talk about.

unfortunately, now i'm at a complete loss as to who i should reach out to for letters of recommendation for my grad school applications. i have two professors who i did get to know relatively well and have asked, but i need a third for one of my programs and could really use someone who's in the field i'm intending to go into, because for whatever reason the two professors i have in mind are both past english professors of mine, and i'm applying for a masters in mental health counseling program, so it's not totally related. i'm just at a loss because i really want to be applying for fall 2024 because i'll have to take a whole year off otherwise, but i have to have letters of recommendation by early january, so this quarter is my chance to connect with my professors.

does anyone have advice on how to connect with professors? i feel weird about it because i feel like it seems like i'm just desperate for a letter of rec (which, yeah) but i do also just want to be able to talk to some people in my field and stuff. any advice is greatly appreciated.",advice

for a variety of reasons, i absolutely cannot delay my graduation for an extra quarter. i’m luckily getting in state tuition, but one of the personal conditions of my transfer between my family and i was that i would graduate on time. i absolutely cannot take an extra quarter, and my advisers aren’t working with me on this. 

even worse, i’d be taking an extra quarter to fulfill requirements such as freshman year physics or a 100 level writing class that i was unable to get into. i find this incredibly frustrating, and i’m not sure what to do besides overload my schedule for the next two quarters to make my graduation deadline. has anyone experienced this, and what was the solution you came to?

"do not have any second thoughts about graduate certificates at uw or else you will lose money i really do not like the way that uw handles graduate school work at their school, so much so that i will be looking elsewhere after experiencing what happens when you quickly decide you do not want to do it. there are plenty of really nice schools in wa that i am sure do not do this. you have only 7 days to drop out of your classes, otherwise, you have to pay 50% of your entire tuition for that quarter. that is absolutely absurd. so at a minimum, if you have any second thoughts after only a week into a certificate, you are already paying well over a thousand dollars for it. i don't want to call it a scam, but wow, i really know how uw is getting a lot of their money from students after experiencing this unfortunate circumstance myself. that is an insane system that is far too harsh on anyone that is wanting to better their lives.  


the fact that they prop it up as something that is possible for people that are working full-time and that you can accomplish a certificate that can then lead into a graduate degree feels misleading, so i dropped my classes and wanted out. i genuinely wonder how many other people have had their money taken by uw because after a week into their certificate they went ""yeah, i don't like this."" 7 days is way too soon to charge the 50% of the entire quarter tuition and it is infuriating. i also really do not like how they do not make this information more aware. so, for anyone that is wondering about certificates at uw, watch out. be 100% locked in on your decision or you are getting to get screwed over.",advice

"questions about safety, transportation, social life, and academics at udub hi!:) i’m a singaporean student who is considering studying (undergrad) psychology in udub. i have some questions below!

safety in the city:
coming from a place as safe as singapore (and also because i’m a small asian female), i'm wondering about the safety aspects in seattle. what's the general consensus on when it's safe to walk outside, especially as a female, whether alone or in a group? any safety precautions or tips i should be aware of? i'm looking to work on my situational awareness to adapt to this change should i end up coming to seattle. 


safety in the canpus: 
i saw the post about uw being ranked the 26th most dangerous campus in the us. do y’all say that ranking is valid? were  there really murder, assault or rape cases recently? 😅i googled ‘washington uni murder’ and got nothing in the campus directly. 

transportation in seattle:
do i need a car in seattle? are the cities/towns surrounding seattle accessible without a car? how safe/reliable is public transport? how safe is it to take when i’m on my own, and what time is the latest i should be on it? and for those times when i'd like to explore the surroundings, how much would a rideshare like 'grab' typically cost? 

exploring washington's nature:
i've heard that washington has loads of beautiful nature.  how do those of you without cars manage to enjoy the natural beauty? any tips for public transportation or organized group trips for hiking and such?

udub as a commuter school?:
is udub considered a commuter school? i'll be arriving in seattle alone, and i'm eager to make friends not only with other international students but also with americans. are locals generally open to new friendships? are there any tips for breaking into social circles? are high school cliques challenging to break into?
also, i’m not a huge drinker. in fact i’m not a fan of alcohol although i don’t mind drinking occasionally. would this negatively affect my social life a lot? i’m wondering whether it’ll be difficult to find a bunch of nerdy friends in udub.

lastly, is it common to eat out with friends? i’ll be coming to udub on a budget and probably can’t afford to eat out every day so i wanna know if i’ll suffer a lot socially if i pack my own food or something.


participation in school clubs:
i'm planning to join some school clubs, like some boardgames/d&d clubs, outdoor clubs, and more. do members typically hang out for meals or drinks after club sessions, or do most people head straight home?


psychology program at uw:
lastly, i'm interested in the psychology program at uw. could anyone share their experiences or insights about it? are there direct postgraduate pathways, or do most require work experience?

also, does the school have industry connections and good internship placements? i am hoping to do some marketing related internships in the us just in case i don’t make it into postgrad for psych.

"how competitive and math-y is an economics major? hi, i am a intended philosophy major who is looking to double major in economics, i have heard they are a good combination and i have a bunch of extra credits from doing ib/ap in high school so i either double major or graduate early lol

anyway, i'm not a huge mathy guy, i did pretty well in high school calculus but was always more of a humanities guy which is why i have philosophy as my major which is my passion. however, i took an ib econ class in high school and enjoyed it, though it was pretty basic concepts. how much math is involved in the more advanced econ classes at udub?

also, from some older posts (6-7 years ago) on this sub, a common discussion is about how rampant cheating is in upper-level econ classes. apparently, there are hella international students who will do anything to get the perfect score in these classes, and since they are apparently curved pretty hard,  honest students' gpas get tanked. as a student who is planning on going on to grad/law school, would these upper-level econ classes tank my gpa and lower my chances?

so is the state of econ at udub still very competitive, gpa-killing, and rampant with cheating, or is it better now? should someone who's not really into math still take the major (ba, of course, you couldn't force me to take all the math classes required for an econ bs)?

also as a side note, i was looking into sociology as a possible double major with philosophy instead of econ, since it seems to overlap with econ concepts a lot but just a lot less math.

also also, i have had a meeting with my advisor about all this stuff but bro just told me to ""take an econ class and see if you like it"" which was ultimately pretty useless ngl",academics

and apparently ta found out that there are some files that are identical (since they demoed to the same ta) and reported to the professor.

today the four of us had a meeting with the professor, my lab partner tried not to put the blame on another group so he was saying he “took some pictures of the code and copied it” but the prof didn’t buy it.

the professor suspect that me and another person in another group (not my lab partner’s friend) are “potentially getting sucked in the situation for what other people did” but because he didn’t believe the story my partner gave him, so he is reporting the incident to the college level and we should hear back next week.

"sad hitting hard, haven’t gone off campus once except to eat at the ave. anything fun to do/see in seattle? museums? exhibits? hi! i’m a first year student, out of state. lately, school for some reason has been making me feel super depressed so much so that most days i don’t leave my dorm/residence hall even if i have classes to attend. because of this i’ve been kinda struggling academically, but that’s beside the point. 

i have no reason to be depressed- i have friends on campus i talk to and text, friends that cook for me, i’m on antidepressants, i have a sun lamp and i have a therapist i talk to. i’m also a part of a bunch of clubs and am on hall council for my residential hall so i am involved in some events. i have hobbies that i keep up with too like drawing. 

i feel as though the problem is that i don’t go out much. since arriving in seattle in september, the only place outside campus i’ve gone to is the ave. i’ve been meaning to hang out in the city with my friends however we can never find a time where we’re all free. so i thought this week/ next week i could take an excursion into the city and do something fun to cheer me up.

are there any fun things i can do with others or by myself in seattle? for context i am a woman so would it be safe for me to even go and do things by myself in the city? also is it normal for freshmen students to feel super depressed when starting college?",advice

to add on: i moved out here because i wanted to embrace my love for my culture, which is represented super well, study finance among the super brilliant classmates i would have, and for the change of scenery… and all of that has backfired on me. i was so sure, sooooo sure, that all of this would pan out. i didn’t even imagine ending up in a situation like this.

that being said, both the master of human-computer interaction and design (mhcid) and the m.s. in human-centered design & engineering (hcde) rank very highly and i plan to apply to hcde. though i want to make sure this school is worth it for me. 

wpi has decent academics, though i feel the vibes on campus are not the best, the people are very similar, and the school doesn't offer enough events that students are actually interested in.

"californian attending wsu interested in transferring here. i'm originally from california and transferred to wsu this fall after 3 years at community college. i was recommended to come here since my mother, sister and brother in law attended here. my major is computer engineering. my experience at wsu has been very unprofessional. not with my classes per say, but how i've been treated by the administration and staff as a california transfer. this has resulted me in seeking to transfer out, one of the schools i'm interested in being udub.

i've had a lot of problems getting classes transferred over here for credit, one of them i'm having to retake because wsu doesn't uphold the one from ca as their equal. i've had to submit plenty of course evaluation forms because wsu marked some of my classes (like linear algebra) as electives. the engineering counselors are lackluster. the university is also making me take a bunch of classes i never thought i would have to take, extending  my time here about 1-2 semesters (3 years here total), unless this is how it is for all transfer students at other universities. originally i intended to transfer to cal poly slo, so i completed all classes relative for transferring over there, and all california universities and community colleges are extremely tight, making it easy to transfer for in-state students (assist website).

i've had other huge problems, such as the residency living situation (they refused to move me out of a freshman dorm until a month and a half later, which i never prioritized on my application, and i'm 21 and applied for an upperclassman dorm). traveling around here is fairly restricted, with a bus transit system which isn't the best. you have moscow, idaho, 6 miles down the road but i have no personal vehicle. pullman is a very small town in the middle of nowhere dependent on the student life to keep it thriving. my family also owns a house in bremerton, and my sister and brother in law live in gig harbor, so i'd be closer to family. and frankly, i am not going to frats or partying as much as most people here (which is what this uni is known for) since i am a junior-level engineering major, where as the life at udub is more studious (or am i wrong? or is there a good social life as well?).

eventually, i will have to take higher level cs classes and the cs department here is extremely cutthroat, with terrible professors who are constantly leaving and wsu is bringing in international grad students to teach these classes. this seems to be a problem with wsu in general though, not just limited to the cs department since my diffy q class next semester has an international grad student teaching it. wsu seems to make very impulsive decisions, and lacks proper investment with their money. lots of places are run down around here and could use improvement, but instead they're dedicating 80 million dollars to a new engineering building which i think is outrageous and totally unnecessary with the one we have now.

i  did some research here and read that udub prioritizes transfer students who are not attending a 4 year institution. i'm wondering how that  would affect my chances in getting in here. the comp e program here is very similar to ee, so i would apply for the ece program at udub. my current gpa from transferring to wsu is 3.6, and i intend on getting a 3.7-4 gpa this semester. i'm also technically a wa resident, since i used my military background to get out of having to pay out-of-state tuition here at wsu and received a wa dl as a result.

can anyone give me advice who has been in a similar situation? also, how does udub compare to my experiences here at wsu with administration, the staff, treatment as a california out-of-state transfer, and getting credit for my classes?",advice

"disappointed with fish 340 / biol 340 experience - lorenz hauser - name and shame! as a junior, a poc, someone with financial struggles, and academically as someone who has taken very difficult classes, this ranks as one of the worst classes that i’ve taken at the uw and other students can agree with me. 

we had a very  challenging time in fish 340 / biol 340 under lorenz hauser's instruction, alongside tas bryan and marta. the course lacked organization, making it difficult to navigate. despite efforts to seek help, explanations often fell short. grading was not ideal across the board—receiving conflicting advice from tas and classmates online in feedbackfruits made it perplexing to discern what was needed for assignments. lab sessions were similarly confusing, with changing instructions creating difficulties in following along and performing experiments effectively. while the course material itself wasn't overly complex, the delivery and guidance were subpar, hindering the learning experience. there were instances during labs where seeking guidance resulted in no responses, “i can’t tell you the answer’ by the tas, leaving us feeling stranded rather than guided. the grading of exams seemed arbitrary, and the subjectivity of the graders left many of us anxious about our final grades. additionally, the use of chatgpt  by the tas during office hours, without solid expertise in genetics, added to the frustration. considering my experience, i'd suggest exploring alternative courses if possible. 

compilation student remarks: 

“grading was horrible in the class, they never told us what’s wrong. one ta would tell me that i wrote my discussion section fine and not to worry about it, while the other ta would tell me to rewrite the entire section (bryan mostly, with marta being the lenient grader, but this went back and forth depending on what i showed them on my laptop.) this experience was repeated during multiple office hours, with the tas giving me one piece of advice, the professor, and the somewhat terrible advice that students would give each other because things were graded on feedback fruits.”

“like for the first couple of labs as well—they were changing numbers during our session and it made things confusing for me to process, because like im listening tot them change instructions, then having to write it down, then i am needing to actually perform the experiment.”

“while the content itself wasn’t super challenging their instruction and way of delivering it made things very challenging.”

“during some of the labs, bryan would tell us that ‘he can’t give us the answer’ all we are doing is asking for some guidance and you’re replying with that… most likely they didn’t know the answers themselves either.”

"master of communication in digital media advice - 2024 a changing climate. hey, i was wondering if there is anyone who can speak to the masters of communication in digital media. 

i just turned 29 and have only recently started working 2 years ago. i am finding that my gap in experience is holding me back as every job interview i get beaten out by someone with years of experience or a specific degree. 

i currently work full time as a digital marketing manager at a startup then freelance work sporadically before that. my main focus is on content strategy, production and execution. i would love to involve myself more with the process and have an understanding of it all at a higher level. i seem to be stuck in a position where i am only planning, creating and posting content and none of the higher level stuff. 

i'm really happy where my content is at and i'm very capable with social media and most of the digital landscape but i really want to advance my career. i seem to be held back with lack of training/experience in the field. i would love to break into the tech industry.

this degree looks perfect, a blend of what i'm already doing + the extra knowledge that will allow me to take on bigger and better positions. does anyone have any experience with it?

"professor not responding to emails about being sick? hi! here is some context 

i have been intermittently sick all quarter, at first it was a respiratory infection, then strep, and through that i was sucking it up, wearing a mask and showing up to classes and exams. however, over thanksgiving break i started to feel even worse and got some blood work done. on top of all of that i have mono!! that week it hit me like a truck and i couldn't stay away for more than 5ish hours at a time, usually just laying in bed. due to various complications, i ended up also getting tonsillitis. through this, i have tried my best to do all of my assignments and i immediately emailed my professors to let them know what the situation was and i even included a note from my doctor. i told them that i was sick, still doing canvas assignments, but wouldn't be able to make it in person for a while.

every single professor responded except for my physics professor. i double checked his syllabus and it says to email him about absences, not a ta. it's been weeks and i've sent a follow up email. his is the only class i'm in with graded participation and i'm worried that the ~17 (to be honest it may be even more) days of missed class will affect my grade. 

not sure what to do..... if anyone has advice please let me know because i'm really stressed about this and have just been trying my best.

is there anything i can do to appeal this after the fact? i was in no shape to take that exam. normally i would let it go and accept that sometimes my health is going to take things that matter to me but this might cost me my major. i hate talking about my health with people and grade grubbing but i cannot let this grade stay on my transcript. 

i will go to my professor and do my best but max he gives me some partial cred here and there. 

do you think it would be worth going to urgent care now, a couple of days later to get a note? is there a policy that uw has that i don't know about? can drs help me at all? i'm kind of desperate. i got shot in the foot at the beginning of the race and i don't just want to lay down and take it.

i think what hurt the most was when i had made it through to the last interview round for an entry level position i was really passionate about and was told i was their second top candidate, but they went with someone else since they had more experience.

"bioc 405 study tips hi all,

i am currently in bioc 405 with david veesler, and we have our first exam coming up soon. i have been keeping up with lecture slides, taking notes on prelecture videos and the in person lectures, taken every quiz, and have been doing the practice problems for the post-lecture material. i have also memorized all 20 amino acids and can identify/draw them with no problem, and i know the necessary pka values as well. 

however, with the newer material in the last few lectures such as enzyme kinetics, symmetry, etc., i literally do not know what to write down and study because i have no idea what is being presented to me. part of it is the professors heavy french accent which makes it difficult to understand what he is saying, and the other part of it is the word soup being thrown at us without any practice. we are shown super complex slides/equations and are not given anything really to practice them with. then we are told we need to memorize equations for specific scenarios of enzymes, and pretty much all the rest of the material on the lecture slides as well.

needless to say, despite my diligent studying, i feel quite overwhelmed and unprepared for next week’s exam, and the subsequent exams in this class. i aced gen chem and o chem, but that was largely because the material was presented in a much more interactive way and we were given plenty of practice with the content. here, we are just presented with a ton of info and expected to make sense of it ourselves. i’ve also gathered that the average score for these exams is about 65% or less, which should be an embarrassment to the professors. how do they expect us to understand the content when it’s being presented like this? does anyone have any tips on exam prep for this class? i want to 4.0 it but it does not feel possible. thank you all!

i was thinking about taking math 126 spring quarter. the problem is, i never ""fully completed"" math 125 however i do have credit for it. at my high school, our ap calc ab class had an option to take chs credit instead of the ap test. since i planned on attending a school instate, i opted for the chs credits and transferred them here. for the class, **i got credit for both math 124 & 125**, however in terms of curriculum, we probably made it halfway through 125 (or maybe even less).  


in my current position, is it a bad idea to take math 126? for the record i am a first year student and i have not taken a math class since i graduated high school in 2023. i plan on majoring in informatics, and i will be applying this spring. i already have all of my info pre-reqs complete so now i plan on working on pre-reqs for potential backup majors (like statistics).

here are the options i have thought about but i'm not sure any of them are a good idea.  


* my advisor said that i can retake math 125 to refresh on the course content, however this could be a waste because i already have the credit. (also i have been told that this is risky because if i do poorly, i could have both 125 and 126 ruining my gpa)
* my advisor also suggested that i can just take the class now and spend a lot of time at the instructional center because i'm an omad student.
* my advisor also mentioned that if i'm confident in my info application, i should just wait to see if i'm rejected before thinking about pre-reqs for other majors. in this case, he was suggesting i wait until fall. then if i get into info on my first try, i don't have to worry about taking 126.
* i have also thought about taking the course over the summer at somewhere like edmonds cc, and just transferring it in.  


so i guess my question would be, which out of those options is the best? or is there another option that's better that i don't have listed?

"geography data science: everything you need to know hello dawgs,

if you're reading this, you either didn't get into a major or you're a freak that likes maps. either way, it's going to be okay. 

i'm writing this because there is a severe lack of student resources about the geography data science major, and it is an open major which creates a lot of questions.  so from the coursework to the department to the career prospects, i am going to give you everything i know about being in gds.

**how do you know if gds is for you?** 

you need to have a passion for data visualization, coding, and maps. it is a great technical degree in a growing industry.

first of all, the geography department is a relatively small department of students and faculty that is hidden on the fourth floor of smith hall. from what i've seen, geography coursework is separated into two categories. half of the classes are more humanities-based geography classes focused on the historical, political, and socio-economic aspects of geography. highly interesting, but nothing technical. the other half are data science classes focused on developing maps with custom software and scripting languages.

geography data science is a bachelors of science degree. an audit will require that you take a shit ton of 300 level geography classes, intro cse classes, and a machine learning course(s). 

**the classes i have taken in order of importance:**  
geog 360: intro mapping class focused on an open-source mapping software, qgis. somewhat tedious, maybe a little boring, but highly important.

geog 458: taught by the same prof as 328, another class that teaches more advanced techniques for geospatial web programming. the projects you build in this class can be pretty professional. html/css/mapbox/arcgis api js/node.js/postgresql. also a choose your own adventure and teaches you a lot about mapping ethics.

geog 328: teaches you how to create web based visualizations using javascript/html/css and mapbox. great technical add and covers a lot of material. projects are great for a portfolio.

geog 465: introductory sql class teaching you how to map using a postgresql backend. highly important for full-stack coding, a little tedious at times.

geog 450: a python course focused on creating seattle based visualizations that have nothing to do with maps. teaches python scripting, web crawling, d3.js and more. not the most necessary class but certainly helpful.

favorite profs: 

gunwha oh: the dawg, super sweet korean lady that cares about her job, her students, and maps!

bo zhao: the beast, this guy makes maps like a mofo. best laid-out classes in the major. all on github.

&#x200b;

**career prospects:**

* level one: arcgis monkey, using esri products to build out data viz. this is the most simplistic, most common way to perform gis and the lowest paying.
* level two: gis web dev, create geospatial applications using full stack.
* level three: geospatial data scientist, be a god of the domain. basically, just a data scientist with a geospatial stack, creating data pipelines, viz, applications, and ml models. 

there are infinite ways to make money in geospatial. just think, the more skilled you are the more you are likely to get paid.

where can i work?:  
any tier-one company, of course. anything that has to do with maps. i noticed a lot of government jobs require highly specific geospatial web app skills. even pokemon go hires geography data scientists. look up esri as well, this is one of the largest mapping companies.

classes i have heard about:

urban gis, geog 317 and a few others are all esri based classes using arcgis. supposedly teach you some cool stuff with an industry staple software.

"given my unique situation, should i be putting my graduation date as march or june of 2024? hi all,

i’m a senior who will be graduating this year. i’m in a unique situation where this is my last “real” quarter of classes, as in my last quarter where i will be attending classes in-person. i have finished all of the requirements for my degree and major, and i could have technically applied to graduate after winter quarter. however, i will be taking a full-time credit course load in the spring for two reasons: to finish one of my two minors (only one class remaining) and to be able to receive an additional quarter of the generous financial aid that has essentially paid me to attend school. so, i will only be taking one class for one of my two optional minors i have added on, and the rest will just be fun and easy electives to hit the full time requirement for financial aid. 

all of these classes that i am taking are completely online, and my classes for winter quarter will be concluding at the beginning of march. as a result, i have been looking for full-time jobs starting immediately since i have the availability to begin my career early, and to get a head start versus having to compete with many more people who also will be graduating in june.

here’s my question: on my resume, i have been listing that i am graduating in march of 2024, since i will have technically met every single requirement for my degree, both general electives and my specific concentration, outside of the one optional minor. furthermore, i am afraid if i list june that employers will think i am not available until then and would reject my application thinking i don’t have the availability to start right away. this is something that if granted initial interviews, i plan on clarifying right away that while i could technically have my degree, on paper i technically do not, given the reasons above, but that i will in 3 months. i don’t want to “deceive” anyone, but given my unique situation i think i am better off putting march and then explaining my situation if i am provided an interview

i guess what i’m trying to ask is, is this okay to do? am i technically lying? i don’t want employers to possibly think i am trying to be deceitful or something of the sorts. i saw a tiktok about someone who lied and said they had a degree and they didn’t when they were technically 6 credits short. they had gone through 3 interviews without disclosing it, and had their offer rescinded as a result. i’m not sure if that person was still actively in school or not, but now it has left me paranoid. should i be putting june instead, even though i am able to start right now? any and all advice is greatly appreciated. thank you in advance!",advice

"list of tools and apps that make your student life easier. as a graduate, i realized there are many smart ways i should have utilized during my time in school to enhance productivity. i've come to understand that numerous tools exist that significantly simplify student life. allow me to share a few tools here that can aid you (especially freshmen and sophomores) in navigating your student life.

notion and timetable: these are essential tools for organizing your life. if you spend enough time scrolling through tiktok (i know you do), and you're unaware of these tools, you've been living under a rock. utilize these tools and search for tutorials on youtube about how to effectively use them as a student.

remnote: another must-have tool. this application employs common study methods to enhance your studying experience. it assists in creating flashcards and applying evidence-based memory techniques. don't just take my word for it—look it up on youtube; you won't regret it.

insight trunk newsletter: ever feel left out when conversing with friends who seem to know everything? look up this newsletter on google and make it a habit to read. they provide 10-minute reads on various topics that you can peruse on the bus, during breakfast, or before sleeping. two years from now, you'll become the smartest person in your friend group.

myfitnesspal: now, let's move on to health. first up is myfitnesspal, which helps you track your caloric intake. simply use this app to scan whatever you purchase, and you'll know how many calories you're consuming. it's an excellent choice for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

fitbod: this one is optional. if money isn't an issue and you can afford a personal trainer, that's fantastic! if not, fitbod is a more affordable alternative. it tailors a fitness program based on your weight, height, age, and other factors.

classpass: another important aspect of student life is socializing. while classes should be your priority, this app helps you join multiple local fitness classes. instead of sticking to one place, you now have the opportunity to explore various classes, increasing your chances of meeting new people who share your hobbies.

isavemoney: this is a budgeting app, but honestly, any budgeting app will work. this one is my personal choice.",student life

but i wanted to enroll at udub so much that i instead took several online courses for the fall and winter quarter. it has been some of the best courses i have ever taken even if they were online. i really enjoyed the format and the quality of the courses.

luckily for me, i applied to both american and canadian institutions at that time. i was also accepted by queen's university in canada. and during the time when i took the online courses from uw, i successfully received my canadian student visa, which is kind of a relief for me.

but for me queen's university is good but it is not like udub which has a superiority in stem and cs over almost all universities you can imagine(excluding some top schools, like stanford, and berkeley). i still hope to go there. and that is why i kept taking online courses from uw while i was registered at another university. i still have the opportunity to transfer here without filling out a returning student form or reapply.

so far i had a party on our last day of quiz section and baked cookies. students also brought food. this friday i invited my students out to get some drinks and most are coming! my goal is to break the power barrier between students and tas because we (tas) were undergrads once and i think we are a valuable resource and want my students to always feel comfortable asking me questions/sharing their experiences.

"finals week i graduated from udub back in 2015 and my younger sister is graduating this quarter. i feel like she has been hiding something from me but i could just be overthinking it. she only took 1 class this quarter and never wanted to talk about it, i just know that it was an art class. i know that it’s finals week so i was confused when she left for class on monday when she told me she had a final on wednesday. i thought the last day of instruction was on friday march 8th. i never heard of a professor holding lecture during finals week but it’s been awhile since i attended so maybe things have changed. but then when i asked her about the final she said it was a presentation and an exam. i asked her how would that go and she said that they would take the exam first and then do presentations. she said they might have to extend presentations to monday too if they run out of time this week. i didn’t press her about it because she was getting defensive so i just told her i thought it was odd. is this something professors can do? extend finals into the next week? i have never heard of that happening nor having both a final and a presentation for 1 class. do you think she is lying to me?",academics

"oos affordability (or lack there of) and general advice hi, i just got admitted as an oos applicant into pre social science. i have like a billion questions, so advice on any of them would be greatly appreciated.

in terms of oos affordability, wtf is the deal? i got $4200 from the purple and gold scholarship, so that covers a tiny bit (tysm so so generous 😭) but what am i looking at for total cost? i would look into this on my own but i’m honestly so confused on varying sticker prices. i have around 60k (probably a little less) in college savings, but i know that’s not going to cover all four years, maybe not even one. does the university give any more money based on the fafsa? or am i totally screwed? my fafsa is already messed up because the 2022 information is before my father quit his job and went off the deep-end leaving me in a single income divorced family situation so idk the expected contribution. i think my mom makes around 100k a year but she really only got our house and the cars in the divorce so there’s not a ton of equity there. 

with the financial context set, assuming uw is even an option, how does applying to majors work? this quirky system scares me because i am wholly unsure of my future career and major. i like political science but would probably go to law school after because there’s not a lot of jobs there (especially that pay well). i also like biology and anthropology but don’t want to be in academia. i’m hoping that i’ll find a career that pairs my interests in a way that also pays off my debt lmfao. with my uncertainty in mind, wtf do i do my freshman year. it seems like you have to be proactive about taking prereqs for the majors and that they’re competitive and i feel like it’ll be hard to compete when i literally don’t know where i’ll be competing.

this is a more general question about college trade-offs, but is it really worth it to go somewhere that feels boring and unfulfilling if it’s the cheapest option? i got into umn with honors (i’d have little to no debt there), but it’s only 5 hours from home and i need to get out of the midwest lol. i also found out my ex is going there and i honestly feel like my growth would be stunted if i’m surrounded in the same environment that i’m trying to escape right now. that sounds a little dramatic but the past two years of my life have been hell and this girl embodies all of that suffering lol. also, this is 100% an ego thing, but i’ve worked so hard and academics have been the foundation of my self worth my whole life and i’m going to be dissapointed if i end up at a college half of my hs class goes to.

"competitive major system? my daughter (high school senior) is considering between uw and bu. we are wondering about the competitive major system at uw.

it's a bit complicated for her because she's not sure what she wants to major in. some of the fields she is interested in include economics, business, statistics, informatics, and psychology. she was admitted pre social sciences.

i don’t think it would be a problem if she simply had to pass prerequisite courses with decent grades, but it looks like some of these majors require essays, writing tests, etc., and end up rejecting many if not most of the applicants.

i use a cane as a mobility aid and have to get a basket if i pick up more than like 2 items—i constantly have people walk into me or avoid me because of my cane and the fact that i can’t walk normally like everyone else. it’s difficult for me to get the motivation/energy around my chronic pain and classes to go in the first place and i’m constantly really nervous and uncomfortable there.

not only that but when i go, i go for my weekly groceries because it’s difficult to go every day—and the employees constantly comment on how much i am buying? but i have to, otherwise they won’t give me a bag and i have to struggle to get my groceries back to my dorm. one time, i brought my own bag and they rushed me to get out of there— so much so that while i was trying to put my groceries in my bag (one handed—again, it’s difficult to do things standing with my cane in the other hand supporting me), i dropped a thing of blueberries and had to pick them up by myself, crying and in pain, while another student shoved around me to check out where my groceries were still sitting. 

the north campus dm is even worse, because they do not even have baskets at all. imagine if i was living there and just needed to get more than the two items i can carry in one arm! 

rant about how the dm treats students aside, i would love some advice on how to spend my dining money more effectively while combating my disabilities (mental and physical), pain, and social anxiety.

"a&a 4 year plan (junior) i'm in a weird spot where i became a student at uw with slightly less than one full year completed on the 4 year plan for a&a. i had basically everything done except for physics and engr101. i also had some other classes like math 224 and all my a&h classes completed. i've been cramming the classes i need to be finished with my first two years (currently taking cee220, me230, and phys123). after this, all i need is amath301 and aa260. my original plan was to do aa260 this summer and amath301 in the autumn. but i've recently been thinking about just taking both classes in the summer. the only downside is i won't be living here this summer and i'll have to commute to uw. i also just applied for my major through the capacity constrained route, so lots of this stuff is just up in the air for now. i was wondering if anyone else had recommendations for what classes i should take in the summer if i do get into my major. starting in the autumn, i'll be set to take aa310, aa311, aa320 and the undergraduate seminar class. do you think it would be too hard to take amath301 with all these classes? and do all these a&a classes have exams or are they more project focused? i was also thinking about taking me123 at some point and figured i might be able to take it in the autumn of i don't end up doing amath301.",advice

"math credit waived for taking higher level class? i’m in a really dumb situation that i put myself in and i so desperately need guidance or advice. i had math 125/126 credit from running start, and throughout college i took math 207/207/224 for my degree. note …. i did not have math 124 credit because of some technicalities. i (stupidly) assumed that eventually i could get it waived somehow, so i put off even dealing with the credit until now as a senior.

last quarter i went to my advisors and asked for waiver, and while they seemed somewhat hopeful that it would get waived they eventually got back to me and informed me that it isn’t able to be waived. and not only that, i’m not eligible to take the course for credit at uw because the math department has a rule about taking a lower-level class for credit … so my only option would have been to take it at a community college or to take a higher level course (either math 209, or upper level amath course, etc) for substitution. i tried looking into a local community college but that would have been ~$1000 i would have had to pay out of pocket for, which i can’t afford, so i tried sucking it up and taking one of the amath courses this quarter.

it’s just not going well for me. the course is so difficult and beyond my understanding or interest. i go to class, and i review the notes but a single problem takes me 1-2 hours just to create a gameplan and understand what to do. my professor’s office hours was full with almost a third of the class there too, and others have made comments about our first homework’s difficulty. i’m also just going through so much in life right now, like i just broke up with my long-term partner of 4 years and now i have to go through the process of moving back home. other stuff also going on in my life but honestly the breakup is the one hitting pretty hard. 

i thought i could just deal with this but to be honest i can’t. this is really difficult for me. maybe i’m being entitled but i was shocked that the solution was to take a significantly higher-level course for credit that i otherwise wouldn’t have been expected to take. 

has anyone ever been in a situation like this before? does anyone have advice? i was thinking of going to the math department’s advising hours tomorrow and asking them directly for help since i haven’t done that yet. i knownit’s such a dumb situation i did to myself, and i need to deal with the consequences, but i’m feeling so hopeless because i don’t think i can do this.",advice
"dorming dilemma for an incoming freshman hey y'all, i'm an incoming freshman at uw and am really struggling to pick a housing option for the upcoming school year. i would like to stay on-campus due to easier access to classes and general convenience; however, i am quite hesitant to be paired up with a random roommate(s) and would like a single room option, if possible.   


from my research so far, it seems like hansee hall is the only undergrad dorm with singles. this, though, comes with a communal bathroom, which i don't think i'll adjust well to. apartments seem like the best option, so i've been looking into cedar, mercer court, nordheim, radford, and stevens. getting a single at any of these as a freshman, however, seems very challenging. are any of these apartments feasible for my situation? if not, should i just resort to commuting from home (it's only a 30-minute drive by car)? please note that money/finances isn't an issue.

"dropping class with an a? we had a major project in a course due this week and i got it back and received a ~93. while this is a good score, i strongly disagree with the points taken off. some of the points lost were due to things out of my control, or i feel like the professor was not clear in their own instruction. the rubric was super vague and i tried my best given the little time we had to prepare or understand the material (it’s only the third week of the quarter). 

this whole situation left me with a really bad feeling for the rest of the quarter. i’m worried that i will continue to be graded arbitrarily and will remain frustrated with the course. 

i believe i’m still within the time frame to drop a class, however i feel really dumb dropping a class where i am currently at about a 98%. am i being overly sensitive or am i correct in getting out early before there are serious impacts due to the grading system? i’m worried about the grading getting more and more unreasonable as the course progresses and new content gets introduced.
