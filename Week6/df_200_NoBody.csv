"s/ns for a major elective i need 7 major credits to graduate and am currently taking 12 since i wanted to squeeze in as much content as possible before i'm out of here. one of my classes (cse 457) is very very difficult and while i enjoy the content to be completely honest i just don't feel like busting my ass 1) because it's my last quarter here and 2) coronavirus just kinda kills the vibe already. i don't need 457 to graduate so i'm thinking about s/nsing it (i don't want to drop because i do still want to learn the material). are there any repercussions to this? i'm going into industry next year, but a masters program / grad school isn't off the table for me within the next 5-10 years. does anyone have experience with how this would look if i wanted to apply to higher education programs? also if i were to s/ns does it show the week you s/nsd (just like the week you dropped if you have a w)?",academics

"late drop math 308 hi,

i am currently taking math 308, phys 121, and afram 337 and research credits. i'm a freshman applying to computer science this summer.  i did poorly on the first 308 midterm and i think at best i could get a 3.3.   my other classes have been: math 125: 3.8, math 126: 3.7, cse 142/143: 3.8/4.0 engl 111: 4.0, engr 115: 4.0.  will having the w on my transcript be more detrimental than having a grade around a 3.3 for math 308 (best case scenario)?  it's been hard adjusting to online classes so it makes me think that an admissions committee wouldn't really care as much if you had a late drop in spring quarter.

i appreciate any suggestions.",admissions

"lul imagine being a wa resident but paying oos tuition my mom holds an f1 and lived with me for the past 3 years. 

so im financially dependent, and since my mom holds an f1, apparently that automatically makes her a non resident. and i never knew that i had to live in wa for 36 months before i get my high school diploma. 

i've lived here for the past three years, i never got to go home to taiwan, and now i have to pay oos tuition despite being a wa resident with id, bank account, and insurance stating that i am, in fact, a wa resident. 

i can't believe this. im speechless. i am hyperventilating because i cant fucking afford my tuition. even with my fafsa aid this basically tells me to go fuck myself and die trying to get enough money for tuition.

"lul imagine being a citizen and permanent resident of wa and being denied residence this is an update to an earlier post. 

to all those wondering, yes this is bullshit, and yes i am frustrated as fuck.

so the residency office replied. they told me according to this [subsection of an entire fucking page of laws](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=250-18-020) that i do not qualify(subsection iii). which then when i read it, it says this(for qualification for residence for tuition purposes)

(e) has met all of the following:

(i) has either:

(a) completed the full senior year of high school at a washington public or private high school approved under chapter [**28a.195**](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=28a.195) rcw and obtained a high school diploma at a washington public or private high school approved under chapter [**28a.195**](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=28a.195) rcw; or

(b) received the equivalent of a high school diploma;

(ii) has resided in washington at least thirty-six months immediately prior to receiving the diploma or equivalent;

(iii) has resided continuously in washington state after receiving the diploma or equivalent until the time of admittance to an institution; and

(iv) has provided an affidavit to the institution indicating one of the following

notice that it says has met all the following *then* \*has either\* which leads me to believe that i do qualify for residence for tuition purposes. because the word ""either"" means you can have one or the other, that means while i don't qualify with (iii) i do qualify with (a). using one subsection to negate the fact that i qualify for everything else, and to use that to milk cash from me is utterly despicable. 

using one subsection that is arguably negotiable to deny me outright is so stupid. i don't know how that is legal. the law says either, and i do qualify for everything else except for (iii). that's not logical at all. this is bullshit and everyone i know who's aware of this situation agrees with me. 

the options here are a or b, not a and b. i'm going to bring this up to them and see how they respond. this is ridiculous.

"an unpopular opinion i would actually prefer fall quarter to be completely online.

yes, i'm fricking sick of staying home, and yes, i'm sick of zoom. i have zero motivation and am depressed most days because of this global pandemic. but that's very minuscule compared to people's health and seeing loved ones with family, die. i don't think i'd feel safe to go back to a university, with 20,000+ people in the usa alone diagnosed with covid-19 daily right now. i'm sure this number would decrease by september, but i doubt this whole thing will be over. with that being said, i would feel very uncomfortable, even with social distancing (we all know there will be some people who don't comply) and mask usage (not everyone will wear masks, obviously). we wouldn't know who has the virus because covid can stay asymptomatic for 2 weeks, we don't know whether the doorknob we touch or the desk we lean against has virus germs on it. students live with grandparents or people who are more vulnerable to covid-19. commuting students also take public transportation systems that are used by a lot of people. people's safety and human lives are so, so much more important than some attendance points.

i know seattle is slowly flattening the curve. even though we were the state that had the first covid-19 patient back in january, i really do believe we are handling it very well and at a quicker pace than other states since our city has tech jobs. this allowed people to start working from home early. seattle's doing great, and statistics are showing that the curve is very slowly flattening (barely below 200 on may 11th! thank you healthcare workers :') ) but even a small, localized outbreak leads to trouble, and we have seen that with other countries who have started to become less restrictive when their cases have dropped. i know a lot of fellow peers right now are feeling hella lonely, sad, anxious, etc., and i know this would suck for the incoming freshman, but the more we take this pandemic seriously and the safer measures we take, the less *deaths* and diagnoses we will have to see. for many people, this is a *deadly* pandemic.

"zoom must die *tl;dr: zoom is a product that wasn’t designed with you — the user — in mind: it has numerous security flaws, is blatantly evil and more than happy to give your data to the government (and china), and is poorly if at all engineered. stop using zoom. if you can, please help me* [*write uw officials*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jxee09i8ncgxm4ihiy66cxy8d4qiif3dhj4ogjaa6i/edit) *to get us off of zoom.*

i hate zoom. i’m just going to put it out there, so take everything i say with a grain of salt. it’s biased, and mostly an angry rant. before getting into valid reasons for why you should avoid zoom like the plague (not that we’re doing a good job of that right now 😉), let me first go through a subjective assessment of the product.

to me, zoom feels like something designed for enterprise it people that just sucks up your money: it’s bloated with configuration options everywhere, you have to adapt to the product’s workflow instead of the other way around, it doesn’t respect you, on and on.

first off, why do i need to install a desktop app? it’s 2020 people, we’ve figured out how to do video on the web. and here’s the real kicker: zoom *does* actually have a web interface, but it *purposefully* sucks to encourage you to use their desktop clients. if you click a zoom link and don’t have the desktop app installed, the app will start auto-downloading and a dialog will pop up asking you to open the app. not only is auto-downloading their crap invasive, but i didn’t ask for that. i just want to join a meeting, not use your software. why are you getting in my way? then, if you cancel the download and browser pop-up, you can click to try again which will open another pop-up. only after cancelling that second pop-up will a teeny-tiny option appear at the bottom of the page to “join from your browser.” you can see what i’m talking about [here](https://assets.zoom.us/images/en-us/web/misc/launching-page.png). now that’s just evil. your product should be about the customer and making people’s lives easier, not your stupid growth goals.

next, why is the user interface so terrible? the desktop app doesn’t even scale to my 4k screen (first world problems, i know, sorry) so that means i have to squint just to read anything. i’m not going to bother elaborating further since this is subjective, but in general, zoom looks gross to me.

more importantly, let’s talk about user experience for a second, or rather how zoom doesn’t give a shit about you. if you’ve tried using the desktop app, i’m sure you’ve been annoyed at how the zoom app will randomly maximize and take over your screen. or how you can’t actually close it, the app just collapses instead. or how the comments are a separate window that you have to keep track of. and i haven’t been a zoom host before, but several of my professors complained about how sharing their screen makes the rest of zoom disappear so they can’t see the comments or other people. and how stupid can zoom be to force call “hosts?” why can’t i join the call early and chit-chat with people beforehand? in general call hosts are a retarded idea only needed for billing ([you pay per host](https://zoom.us/pricing)). and don’t even get me started on the streaming quality. i can’t think of a single call that didn’t have audio artifacts and glitches. again, how stupid can you be? audio is *the* most important part of a call. sure, video is great but if i can’t hear what someone is saying then what’s the point? zoom seems to prioritize the video stream, or based on my low opinion of them, they don’t prioritize anything and just hope it works out.

collecting a few unrelated terrible experiences, why can’t someone who joined the call see the comment history? i dunno about you, but the same links ended up getting posted like five times throughout the lecture because anytime you go to a breakout room, all the previous history is lost. and breakout rooms, ugh. why can’t i see the original stream at the same time as my breakout room? now i’ve lost all context of the presentation and why we’re in this thing in the first place. and then i’m treated like a child and kicked out of the room while in the middle of an interesting/fun conversation because the timer ran out. (\*insert spider-man pointing meme about how poster sounds like a whiny baby\*)

now for the objective reasons we must stop using zoom: let’s talk about security. zoom has no idea what they’re doing and will blatantly lie to you. i started re-googling security flaws for this post and literally *this morning*, [another zero-day came out](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/zoom-security-flaw-windows). zoom is happy to [delete free-speech because china wants them to](https://www.wired.com/story/zoom-china-facebook-fbi-security-news/) and claim they are an american company but [it's developed in china](https://technode.com/2020/04/13/is-zoom-crazy-to-count-on-chinese-rd/). until people complained, they were only going to [give encryption to paying customers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294355/zoom-security-end-to-end-encryptoin-beta-release-july-2020-new-feature) so that they could [sell your data to the police/government](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/3/21279285/zoom-fbi-encryption-calls-free-users). and this was in june! how heartless and tone-deaf do you have to be? and their [encryption is a lie anyway](https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=28812%5c) or maybe they’re just so stupid they don’t understand cryptography. their website is also [full of vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/zoom-us-vulnerability-could-trigger-xss). they [lie about how many users they have](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement), they [sell your data to advertisers](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/zoom-privacy-issues), their desktop app [steals your password](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/zoom-bug-can-let-hackers-steal-your-windows-password/article31233645.ece#:~:text=users%20windows%20password.-,the%20'zoom%20client%20for%20windows'%20is%20vulnerable%20to%20the%20',matthew%20hickey%20and%20mohamed%20a.), i could go on. here’s a [much more educated write-up](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/) than my rant on their shitty security if you’re interested.

*the point: uw is mostly going to have online classes again despite claims of being “hybrid.”* ***your tuition money is paying for zoom.*** *make it stop.*

so what do we use instead? i’m biased, but i think we should be using google meet. breakout rooms are the only real missing piece (though i would argue we don’t need them anyway), but [those features will be coming](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/26/google-announces-a-bunch-of-features-to-bring-meet-on-par-with-zoom/) at the start of the school year.=

"what should i do about math 124? i need math 124 because it's a pre-req for some classes for psych. i've heard how gruesome the intro math series is here at uw, and i've heard a bad horror story for 124 from my friend, so i decided to take advantage of the online format and take math 124 online at a community college.

well, i'm failing really bad right now. i got a 51/100 on the first test and my professor's had to give me so many accommodations already because i missed the first quiz and a discussion post. at this rate, i'd be lucky to get a 1.7. none of this is curved. the emails i get from the professor always sound so passive aggressive, and he doesn't sound like he trusts me very much because of how much he's had to go out of his way for me. i just feel... deflated.

i've been debating on dropping the class. the deadline to drop the class and get any sort of refund on tuition was the 13th, so if i drop, i lose about $600. i still haven't paid for webassign. the trial ended yesterday, so i can't even check my grades, and there's an assignment due tonight. if i drop, i won't have to pay for webassign. if i try to tough this out, i'll have to fork over for webassign and have to rush to finish the assignment today, while i might not even pass the class.

i asked a psych advisor today, and he said i can afford to wait until next summer to take calc again, which is great to hear. but i don't know how next summer will look for me. i may not even be in the country to take classes. and even then, i live kind of far away from any community colleges as it is, which means i'd have to find a place that offers online calc classes that are transferable to uw.

1. should i drop the class and try again later somehow at some other school or at uw? or should i tough it out?
2. is math 124 at uw really that bad?
3. are there any colleges that offer an online calc class that can transfer to uw?

sorry for the ranty post. this is just causing me so much sadness, but i'm worried that i'll regret wasting so much money and the opportunity to get this out of the way online if i drop.",advice

i’m currently back home in a suburban town in canada and most people don’t wear masks here and no one says anything to them. heck even the us border guards when i was going back to seattle were wearing masks, but when i came back to canada, the border guards there weren’t wearing them and they were sitting less than 2m from each other just chatting.

i think seeing so many “karens” on social media refusing to wear mask and flaunting their white privilege can be frustrating and discouraging, and as much as canadians like to feel we’re superior to the americans, i think the majority of people in the us, or at least in washington state are taking this seriously.

uw's financial aid agreement states the following:

 i understand that this award is based on information i have provided about my financial status. i agree to report to the office of student financial aid any changes in my financial situation, including, but not limited to changes in marital status. i understand that these changes or corrections may result in a reduction of awards and/or require repayment of aid already received.

  
should i just...not report the remarriage? will this jeopardize my ability to receive aid in future years? what happens when, in 2022, i have to include tax returns from this year, which prove that i didn't report a change in marital status as soon as possible? this feels excessively punishing.",rant

"i think the odds are stacked against me - long rant and need advice **\*\*background\*\***

i'm a transfer student and started win20. i've always wanted to pursue a marketing degree cus i'm super creative and i do a pretty good job appealing to peoples' senses (i've always learned about psychology and marketing outside of school through reading books/articles and listening to podcasts). my first quarter at uw was not a great experience, not because of the school itself though. i had multiple personal issues i was dealing with (each issue would've been individually deteriotating for my mental health but nooooo i had mutlple of them at the same time). this resulted in a 2.2 in both acctg225 and mgmt200...foster's notorious weed out classes. the only saving grace is that i got a 3.9 gpa during spr20 (but i intentionally chose easy classes cus covid). i don't want to disclose my cum gpa, including the courses i took from my cc that'll be calculated for my foster app, cus i'm a lil embarrassed. i lowkey gave up on applying for foster when this pandemic hit cus i've exceeded the satisfactory progress policy for undergrads and after winter quarter, i had no motivation to continue business anymore--i basically accepted that i was never going to get in. but i was given the opportunity to take the wsa so i can apply for win21, since i already paid for it and it was opened to be proctored online, so i took the ""you miss 100% of the shots you don't take"" idea and gave it a try. i'm actually a pretty solid writer, i've always excelled in hs and college courses that include essay-writing. but the wsa was something else....

**\*\*actual rant\*\***

i thought taking the wsa at the comfort of my own home would be a slight advantage, but i think it proved to be a disadvantage after taking it. my dad is a busy carpenter where he's kind of on-call 24/7 and he gets calls constantly day and night. i'm cantonese, and for those of you that are also canto or know someone who's canto, we're loud. when we talk to each other in canto, it sounds like we're yelling at each other. it was impossible to find a quiet workplace where i can take my assessment since our walls are thin af and my house is relatively small.

i ""studied"" intensely for about two weeks prior to taking it and was almost lost on most of the days i was studying. honestly, the studying was like i revisted taking an english course on how to build an argumentative essay and using grammar correctly, read articles and listened to podcasts back-to-back, i basically read the dictionary, and i did the practice prompts over and over again (switching up different answers to force myself to learn how to support my claims). but the owrc was closed so i couldn't even get a competent person to review and provide feedback. none of my friends have a background in writing so when i showed them my answers, they only said positive things but i knew i had inconsistencies in my writing.

overall, i think i did aggresively okay on the wsa. im very confident i aced the persuasion section (i wrote that ishhh perfectly imo) but the position prompt....it was an easy one but idk why i can never come up with examples at the time i was writing it but i was able to think of a million examples after i submitted it. i spent too much time thinking of examples but my mind kept going blank. when i eventually thought of an example, i had less than 15 minutes to finish 80% of the position section. it was sloppy and i basically didn't finish. however...i did get my main points in. i wouldn't be surprised if uw contacted me and asked if i had a different person answering the position prompt. it was like a middle schooler wrote it.

**\*\*advice???\*\***

i might sound pessimistic but tbh i think i'm being realistic. i don't feel confident in getting into foster and everyone around me keeps saying ""stay positive!"" ""i believe in yeww"" but it honestly doesn't help, it makes me feel worse actually. this is where my reddit pipo come in, **i need advice** on what to do cus i basically have 2 options at this point:

1. i'm currently taking prereqs towards an english degree as my fail/safe. i'm pretty good at it, i like writing (but primarily research and analysis), i don't like lit and i heard the program consists a lot of it (boooo), and it's an open major. i don't plan on going through with english as a career path though. i'm probably going to self-teach marketing on my own and probably find a job within that path. i've found that learning on my own allows my brain to absorb the information better than school so maybe it's a blessing in disguise. also i have to fulfill a foreign language requirement and i never took any foreign languages so that might set me back from graduating on time. i might just learn a language on my own and take the proficency exam to move me up so i can acquire credit and graduate on time--but i'm being optimistic if i think i can learn a language on my own.
2. take the wsa again and apply for foster for spr21. i'm anticipating a 4.0 for this fall so maybe it can spruce up my cum gpa. keep in mind that i've exceeded my 105 credits for the satisfactory progress policy and i can ask my advisor for an extension...but i already asked for one and told her i was going to pursue an english degree. i'm not even sure if i can do this cus i might just declare my english major during fall.",rant

"sophomore cse major who needs help building resume first off please don't be toxic and say stuff like ""you don't deserve to be in cse"" and stuff like that. i heard plenty of that during my freshman year when i took math 12x and cse14x.

i don't have a good or a complete resume yet. the only real thing i have done that looks good on my resume is i've been private tutoring college students in their intro cse classes since the summer. i have a couple of generic stuff like work experience at the library, etc.

so yeah nothing good. i'm planning to try to get internships my junior year but after getting rejected from cse 14x ta application for the second time in a row i'm now worried that i won't be able to build a good enough resume for anyone to hire me as an intern.

i'm still want to be a ta for 14x or maybe even one of the cse major classes like 331. i want to do some personal projects with android and ios apps and put that on my resume. i'll still be private tutoring for the winter quarter but then i will stop because i will be taking 332 and 312 in the spring and i will be focusing on that.

other than that, i'm not sure how i can find opportunities to improve my resume (especially during these covid times). i feel pretty imitated because i know a lot of cse majors who have great resumes and i'm just worried that all the internships will be taken because of the competition.

so basically what i'm asking for is advice on how i can make a good resume in the next nine or so months.

also, do i have to get a letter of recommendation or a referral from a cse professor?

"so, fall quarter is over... (i needed to process this out somewhere, feel free to not read past this... or, mods, delete this if this isn't the place.)

...and i don't feel great about it. i usually have a fulfilling and cathartic release of stress around this time of each break. we all have bad days, but i'm struggling to figure out how this 12-week-long period got this particularly bad for me inside and outside of academics.

i think it starts with my living situation. i'm pretty extroverted, and i draw a lot of my energy and motivation from being around other people. covid has obviously prevented me from hanging out with a lot of my closest friends, especially so since my parents have health issues. however, i was lucky enough to snag a studio off 45th in the u district for the academic year. i was chiefly hoping that despite my extroverted nature, i could pick up where i left off in living on my own and learn how to be truly self-sufficient and have fun on my own. a few in-state and oos friends of mine also moved here for the year, so i was hoping to also see a few friends from time to time without endangering my parents and get fresh air between my classes. however, i've only felt lonelier than i ever have in my life. i'm the kind of person who can get lonely surrounded by a crowd of people, so living alone has felt really isolating. it doesn't help that most of my friends here haven't really made an effort to keep in touch much. maybe they're busy? wouldn't explain why they're holding parties in their apartments. (maybe i dodged a bullet.) basically everyone i know has roommates and it's unsafe for them to see people outside their household, too, for obvious reasons. regardless, i tried taking matters in my own hands and forgetting about matters i couldn't control. (i also tried using bumble for a week but it ultimately hurt my mental health even more before i got rid of it.) it also doesn't help that the sun sets so early here nowadays and we get barely any breaks in the clouds.

i also feel like my academic workload has added to this. to me, it feels like a majority of stem profs don't know what their students are going through in the pandemic, while others just don't give a shit. how am i supposed to perform at my pre-covid levels when nothing about our lives has fundamentally changed between march and now? when i'm constantly and consistently stressing out about recruiting, paying rent, my family, potus's bs, my duties as an rso officer *and* trying to get good grades, i find it hard to focus on surface integrals or, better yet, self-care—getting enough sleep, exercising, going on walks, meditating, everything i've heard uw and department admin repeatedly stress that students should do to feel better. maybe it's my fault for entering two challenging programs and for taking three stem and one honors class this quarter (and next... and spring '21) to graduate from them on time, and i sure didn't go to college for a free throw. i missed quite a few deadlines this quarter (not normal for me) and i barely made it across the finish line during finals week. i kept leaving things until the last moment just because i felt like i couldn't control my stress like i used to since i'm just... tired.

what did both of these factors combine into? i've had negative feelings and thoughts, and since i have been so isolated in my studio and not been able to get out much due to my schoolwork and weather being so terrible, i've had 24 hours every day to sit in my thoughts and let them stew into worse versions of themselves. my anxiety's high (to where, multiple times this quarter, i've gotten physically sick, started breathing worse, thought i had covid, and thankfully tested negative) and my self esteem is low. i fell into a vicious cycle of getting stressed about work, getting more stressed about loneliness, not doing work, and then getting more stressed about work. i'm having trouble having conversations with people i usually conversed with freely and i get anxious in public. i'm especially getting jealous when i do get outside, end up on the ave, and see people walking in groups and enjoying themselves, something i haven't recalled ever feeling jealous of. i haven't seriously considered jumping off the roof of my building or diving into traffic on roosevelt because i know i have things to look forward to in my future (seeing friends that i still haven't seen since covid since hit washington state... starting a career, raising a family, becoming the best version of myself). however, every day this quarter, i haven't felt like i'm truly learning and enjoying the experience i'm getting from my tuition money, but i have felt like i'm just going through the motions and... surviving instead of living. i can't help but feel dejected and tired from having to hang on for so long. i'm going from making dean's list after a tough schedule of three weed-out classes last spring to probably s/ns-ing a major requirement. moreover, i feel myself slipping from my normally kind, ambitious, and charismatic self to a hateful, despondent, jealous person that i hoped i would never be. i'm tired of feeling like i'm not understood or supported in any way in my life, and i'm tired of constantly having to play catch-up with my work. at the same time, it feels like i'm at war with myself and i'm not even close to winning.

...so, who else feels like they've been reduced to a shell of their former selves this quarter, and doesn't know where to start on rebuilding themselves? 😅

"i fucked up and i need some insight/advice. well, sort of fucked up. i mean, who really knows because the quarter isn't over yet. but beware, this is **long**. i'm on rant-mode instead of grinding homework, and my thoughts are all jumbled up so bear with me!

anyway, i signed up for **19** stem credits for this quarter. yup. econ 483, econ 488, cse 414, and math 126. while the econ classes don't sound stem, they most definitely are in terms of, like, content (one is basically building a whole ds project and the other is causal inference, so both heavy on statistics). needless to say, i might have fucked up.

i'm a senior graduating in june and so i've been trying to cram as much stuff the past few quarters in order to both prep for a career in data analytics and also graduate school. my end-goal in life is to become a data scientist.

so, what brings me to this post? well, i feel the need to drop math 126. is the class hard? no, not yet at least. we've covered relatively simple stuff like vectors, dot product, cross product, lines/planes, etc., and i know there's harder stuff to come. anyway, the workload for this class is a bit tiresome. it is a ""freshman"" class, i know, but i haven't really had this kind of busy-work-heavy class in a while as upper-level classes are more ""quality over quantity"", if that makes sense (like my other classes just have 1 weekly assignment but are more ""intellectually stimulating"", for lack of a better term). it's also harder to justify the workload when the course content isn't exactly applicable to what i want to do, as opposed to the other 3 courses.

anyway, i'm taking math 126 **only** so i can take math 308 next quarter. i need linear/matrix algebra if i want to go into data science or machine learning or anything of that nature. it's like, the bread and butter of that stuff (from what i hear, anyway). i, for the life of me, cannot see why math 126 is a prerequisite for math 308 (everyone i know says they are different completely), but it is what it is.

the dilemma here is about performance and learning. sure, if i was the ideal student, i would work hard and do well in all 4 classes because it is certainly **very** possible. am i the ideal student? fuck no, otherwise i would've took math 126 and 308 ages ago like the rest of you normal people. so, naturally, my grades in econ 483, econ 488, and cse 414 would be a lot higher without math 126 and i would certainly learn a lot more.

take cse 414 for example. this is arguably my most important class. sql and aws and azure and all that are extremely, extremely important for kick-starting a career in data, especially since i'd start as an analyst or data engineer who literally writes sql queries day and night. there is no doubt i will learn less and my grade would suffer because of math 126 taking my time (it has already happened, i've done more webassign than sql practice or anything else). econ 488 is also extremely important (i can tell by the fact that it is taught by an amazon data scientist and 2 of my classmates are literally ml engineers in her team with 1 other classmate being a full-on data scientist already).

i do not need math 126's content specifically. i'm not going to be an engineer who uses physics and all that. i just need 308 so i can do magic with matrices. so, in theory, i could take mit opencourseware's supposedly-amazing class on linear algebra, or buy a great textbook, but i fear that graduate schools won't see it on my transcript and so they will banish my application to the bottom of their trash bin instantly. can anyone with experience applying to graduate schools tell me how this goes, like is there a method of proving prerequisite knowledge without a specific course?

i want to re-iterate that math 126 has not been difficult for me (so far) just in case someone wants to remind me that data scientists should be good at math, this is just more a matter of \*which\* type of mathematics i need and allocating my time and energy properly.

so, here are the **two scenarios**:

1. i drop math 126 before the deadline tonight, and i proceed to do well in econ 488, econ 483, and cse 414 (3.6-3.8 average for the quarter probably) and learn sql and build an econometrics project for my resume and learn all these skills necessary for my career aspirations, but don't take math 308 before graduation so i ""self-study"" linear algebra but greatly hinder my graduate school applications and possibly my future in data science. and also probably feel like a piece of shit for not being able to handle the 4 classes together, so possible existential dread.
2. i don't drop math 126, and i proceed to do ""okay"" in all 4 classes. i get to take math 308 next quarter, but grad schools laugh at my 3.0-3.3 gpa for the winter quarter and recruiters laugh at me as i struggle to write a medium-difficulty sql query during a technical interview. and also i probably lose all my hair in the next 2 months.
3. covid is eradicated by tomorrow -> uw finally opens odegaard -> i pull through with 4 4.0's (i know i said two scenarios but i'm in a joking mood because my life (and this dilemma) is fucking hilarious).

i know that i can certainly land a job in data analytics/engineering without math 308 (because let's be real, i'd just be an sql monkey) but the tricky part is the long-run, where i intend to go to graduate school to elevate my career possibilities. idk.

if you read this whole thing and are preparing to write a comment to provide some advice, you deserve the world (and in-person classes in your near future).

tl:dr i want to drop math 126 so i can focus on the other 3 classes that are **directly** related with my career aspirations, but am also feared i will limit myself in terms of ""making it farther"". i need graduate school to ultimately become a data scientist, and i need math 308 to make myself a good candidate for graduate programs in statistics, data science, cs, or what have you. either provide me with confirmation bias (to drop the class), give me motivation to power through, or simply just laugh at me because what kind of data scientist doesn't do calc 3? it's okay because i laugh at myself too.

i just need to be saved from this 19-credit bullshit but also have to be responsible and if not dropping 126 is the best option, i'll take it and somewhat pull through in the end. just be honest with me.

okay i'm gonna stop writing now and hope my dilemma is clear. ask clarifying questions if need be, i will certainly be active in responding so i can figure this out before 11:59pm.

edit: thought about this a little more and realized the fuck-up isn't really signing up for the 19 credits, the real fuck-up is putting myself in a position where i have to cram like this. ugh. i resent freshman me. ",rant

"uw cse kinda sucks. lectures (in at least 300 level cse classes) are confusing and rushed. i had a better time understanding the textbook or from talking to a classmate than the actual lectures. the biggest problem with lectures is that they only do like one example problem then move on to the next topic.

the one quiz section (the one on thursday) is not useful. only like 7-9 people actually show up (out of 25-30) and we go over the most simple of examples and even some examples that were already covered in lectures. and why do we only get one quiz section? the material covered in 300 and 400 level cse classes is difficult enough to warrant two quiz sections a week.

in programming classes, the homework is painful to do, the ratterm poly hw in 331 takes an absurd amount of time (not only to me but to every classmate i talked to).  programming hws is unnecessarily long; the hw should be challenging and concise, not challenging and tedious.

in 311 and 312, the examples covered in the lectures and quiz section are very basic and simple, but the homework problems are always very complicated and challenging. why not cover intermediate and challenging problems throughout the week so when we can feel more confident in doing the homework?

i know that it's online and all that, but it seems like there is no community in these classes. nobody really talks in breakout rooms or quiz section. everyone seems like they only want to talk to friends they already knew before going into class, instead of actually meeting someone new. the lecturers and tas lack personality that makes the class fun and helps create a community. i took loveless online and he was awesome, he showed that he cared and he is a funny and caring guy. all the lecturers i had so far in cse seem liked they just wanted to do their jobs and nothing more. when i struggled in some cse classes i felt like the lecturer and tas helped me only because they are obligated to do so, not because they cared. when i took loveless, my math ta noticed i went to office hours and quiz section a lot so he actually tried to get to know me as a person and i enjoyed talking to them. in cse classes, there are times where i would go to zoom office hours, and the ta never showed up.

i know that the majority of cs majors don't see anything wrong with what i said. they just understand the material and move on with their day and mind their own business. but as a person who often struggles in 300 and 400 level cse classes, i'm having a terrible and frustrating time.",rant

i hope everyone's start of the new semester has been great! i am currently pursuing my master's at the university of idaho, majoring in environmental sciences. i will be graduating this may. i have already submitted my application to the department of atmospheric sciences for my ph.d. starting this fall. i contacted dr. becky alexander with my profile and she encouraged me to apply and also give me info regarding a potential project she has under her belt.   


i am an international student and i've always been told that the big schools are competitive. my motivation behind applying to the university of idaho was my love for the environment and hoping to contribute as much as i can. and the reason i am switching is my passion to work on climate change. i feel my application is good, with my current research on biofuels being the first of its kind alongside people from pnnl and my fellowship funding from doe. i also have 3 really great recommendations (from the professors i have really good professional relations with), 2 papers i am currently working on, and a master's gpa of 3.6, with a fairly interdisciplinary skillset and a decent amount of co-curricular. i was told that the department is small and the amount of applications they receive is enormous.   


i would like to know from any of the grad students in here about my chances. i have two more schools lined up as my backups but getting into uw will get me a chance to work on something that i've always wanted to do. any help regarding this will be really appreciated.",admissions

what isn’t okay is the advisor i just met up with who rolled their eyes and made faces at me while i tried to ask questions about the essay and what to do from here. they literally said “well what you said isn’t true bc i wouldn’t have done that.” they didn’t even say goodbye to me before i left the zoom, just sat there dumbfounded like i was an insane person. i’ve never been treated like this with an advisor before, it really blew my mind. they didn’t even give me any advise, just told me i had to contact someone else and i was wrong in my assumptions about admissions.

"is anyone else not okay after a year of quarantine? (academically) i've never posted here before, but i really feel like i have to vent and hopefully find someone who relates... 

i'm in my third year, majoring in physics and music, and last quarter i failed two of my classes for the first time in my life. i completely lost my motivation for school after my daily routine being identical for 9 months straight: all day is spent in front of the computer. my desk is my classroom, where i relax, where i hang out with friends, and where i do homework.

this was after i auditioned to major in music in september and didn't get accepted on the instrument of my preference.

this quarter started off promising, i was hoping to find my motivation for academics again, but after a few weeks of missing and assignment here and there and occasionally missing a lecture because it feels pointless to get out of bed, i've found myself failing 2 classes again. i even took only 12 credits this quarter and it's still too much to handle. i only have enough in me for one class. i've tried again and again to put as much effort into all my classes online as i did when they were in person and i've come the conclusion that after this long i just can't. if they didn't introduce the s/ns option for quarters taken during the global pandemic i would have probably dropped out by now.

online classes just feels pointless... ""going to school"" is now just walking 10 feet from my bed to my desk.

gpa: 3.62 w (my school doesn't do unweighted) - i've had a really strong upward trend tho (like a .3 increase to my cumulative gpa each year) because of home life issues which i explained in one of my essays so freshman year i got all bs and a c, sophomore year i got mostly bs and some as, and junior year i got mostly as and a few bs, senior year it's also gone up (i'll end high school with a 3.8) but i don't think they look at senior year grades

3. could share their graduate (master’s degree specifically) experience with me. i am scared to apply because of so many reasons, including the fact that i have not been in school for almost 2 years after graduating. i am worried that i will have nothing to offer in merit alone, as i spent the last two years raising my daughter as a sahm and moving across the states with my husband. i have work experience since i graduated high school but i don’t feel confident that my lack of volunteer work or internships during these two years will be looked at positively.

4. might have any information on the competitiveness of coe admissions. anything is helpful, i was not a struggling student, but my gpa had a small downward trend in my last quarter, due to my pregnancy with my daughter. is the gre required for coe, it says it isn’t for the 2021/2022 academic year, but is this likely to change for the 2022/2023 year?

5. has any knowledge of child care that may be offered by the school/financial aid? i would be moving away from my husband (military and unable to move) and it would likely be just me and my daughter moving if i got accepted. how is it like living in seattle with very young children? are things accessible without a car? i may get one but i’m not sure yet, i am comfortable taking public transportation.",admissions

"[opinionated overview] the whole beef between the asuw and the daily is so incredibly messed up and it makes me so angry. **update:** i have posted a follow-up thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1e3kz/a_followup_on_my_opinionated_overview_and_how_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that includes detailed instructions on submitting complaints and a petition to resolve problems surrounding the sending of the email.

[the cartoon in question](https://preview.redd.it/yvd4q5t2ozv61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90dfd1f3c40f2ead992a6a457b65913ace3b830)

so i, like many of you received an email from asuw (from which i am not subscribed to any newsletter) about racist imagery targeting certain uw students. my first thought was that it was probably some right-wing cartoonist who posted a problematic opinion piece that crossed the line, but i couldn't find it because it seemed to have already been removed. you can see it above here. the general consensus amongst students who have problems with this is essentially that this cartoon compares the majority bipoc candidates to animals (along with a food truck and public art piece).

before i move on and explain why i don't think this is a comparison or racist at all, let me give you the context for the cartoon that the mass-sent email left out. the daily is a student-run newspaper that always posts their candidate endorsements for the asuw elections, which is uw's student government. this year however, likely due to covid-19 and people not being as involved and on-campus, the tickets for the major races stand completely uncontested with one unofficial opposition ticket. the daily this year decided to not endorse any of the candidates, specifically stating that ""this year, the daily has decided not to endorse any of the candidates,  all of whom are qualified for their respective positions but, based on  their performance, are clearly not prepared."" i *highly* encourage you to read the full endorsement article, which can found [here](https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html). you will find that while the writers have both positive and negative opinions on each candidate, they still choose not to endorse any.

now here is where the cartoon comes in: since all of the elections are uncontested, the article pokes fun at this fact by suggesting write-in candidates consisting of iconic uw imagery. any student who has been on campus and many who have not had the chance will be able to recognize these ""candidates"" as staples of the uw's campus culture and jokes pertaining to them have been common for as long as they have existed. now, the medicinal herb garden monkey seems to be the animal people are most upset about, and it does not help that it is one of the more niche uw icons. if you are unaware of the monkey, you can read about it's history and see pictures of it [here](https://magazine.washington.edu/monkey-business-the-story-of-the-uw-medicinal-herb-garden-and-its-guardians). considering all of this information and context, i am hard-pressing in seeing the angle that many critics are presenting that the candidates are being ""compared"" in any way to these animals which only make up a portion of the suggestions.

ultimately, the daily removed this cartoon from their publication and issued an open-letter apology to the asuw. if this is where the controversy ended, i would move on and not make this post but i am sure most of you reading this are aware of the email that was just sent to all uw students from the asuw.

today, the asuw president issued an email to all uw students under the subject ""asuw response to the 04/26 post from the daily"" which claimed, without any context provided, that the daily had published ""racist imagery from the daily surrounding the current asuw elections"". i, like many of you, went to the subreddit and my friends in both the daily staff and the asuw to see what had happened and after which found a cartoon that was blown significantly out of proportion by the asuw.

i am extremely disappointed that the asuw leadership would abuse their power to email every uw student, regardless of subscription status, to paint the daily as racist out of nowhere to the entire student body over a few student's perception of one cartoon from one artist. the daily is a student-run organization that staffs many poc's and has always supported progressive student movements, protests, and actions. it is completely unfair for them to have someone with the power to email every student claim that they published racist imagery after the cartoon was removed and people can't even see the what was posted anymore. how is the daily even supposed to defend themselves if the narrative can be so easily controlled by one side? the calls for the daily to ""do better"" than the apology by donating from their already limited budget to things like mutual aid is outrageous and completely unnecessary. i saw one student say that ""y'all gotta pay reparations anyway"" so the poc staff for the daily better open up their wallets, i guess.

there needs to be consequences for whoever approved this abusive and manipulative email to be sent to the entire student body like this. all it has done is put the safety of the daily staff in jeopardy and given fuel for right-wing pundits to use to indoctrinate even more people who have an irrational fear of cancel culture. however, i for one do not want to wait for action to be taken and call for people to write in ""dubs i"" for every position to show that we are not okay with this kind of behavior from those who are supposed to protect and lift up our student organizations who fight for just causes, especially the press which highlights many civil rights and social justice issues facing the students in our school.

&#x200b;

tldr: the asuw president sent an email to every uw student out of nowhere and with no context claiming that the daily is racist over a cartoon that was no longer publicly available, unfairly controlling the narrative of the situation and putting the safety of the publicly listed staff of the daily in jeopardy.

"an outsider’s thoughts on the asuw stuff i know there’s been a ton of dialogue on asuw and the daily drama recently so i thought i’d join in. 

first, i’m an incoming freshman so i’m not a student at uw yet. i don’t fully understand everything around this issue but from the information i’ve gathered i’ve come to the following conclusions:

1) the asuw president overstepped by sending out that mass email. i’m a bit up in the air on whether she should be recalled but i think i’m leaning towards the opinion that she should.
2) i’m very disappointed in the asuw as an institution. they don’t seem to reflect the student body and i would like to see some reforms put in place to ensure representatives actually represent the students.
3) the asuw needs to stop complaining and start getting stuff done. college is way way way too expensive and the asuw should organize around bringing this cost down and improving the quality of life for students. 
4) the daily’s cartoon wasn’t racist. it was just a list of campus landmarks and was in no way tied to candidates. if, however, the daily had drawn that cartoon so that the landmarks each corresponded to a specific candidate so that the animals corresponded to bipoc candidates, that’d be racist. 

that’s just my 2 cents that nobody asked for. i might run for asuw next year just to raise these issues ngl 

tldr; i wanna see change in the asuw.",discussion

i still have a 3.1 and am well above the 2.0 threshold needed to pass, but i just wish i was physically on campus, virtual learning is hard and i feel detached from the material and it sucks, god how i wish i had the support that i can only derive from physically being there. 

it doesn’t feel like i’m absorbing even half as much as i would if i were physically on campus. it feels like i’m only learning the bare minimum needed to scrape by and not about how i can use what i’ve learnt to solve difficult problems like on webassign.

speaking of which, what even is the point of using an online service for homework? what is the purpose, when there’s no real incentive to challenge yourself being that a; you aren’t really learning or being taught how to actually apply what you’re learning to a wide variety of problems due to distance learning, and b; the questions are recycled year after year meaning you can just look up a solution when your mind goes blank and you’re at a loss. yeah yahoo answers might have shut down, but google still has cached versions of the webpages and archival sites exist. oh and c; you have a diagnosed neurological condition where people think you’re really smart but in actuality you don’t get something until the full ins and outs and applications of it are explained, something you can only get with hands-on learning.

it was already a problem even before the pandemic but now it’s just made even worse, like at least use an algorithm that generates unique problems and gives you hints but not explicit answers for when you’re stuck.

not only in maths but also in computer science/engineering where hands-on learning is essential, like i may superficially understand it in a virtual lecture or from a textbook, but it would be much better if i could actually comment on the programming as it’s being done or verify coulomb’s law using a multimeter on an actual circuit.

like i’ve been directly admitted into one of the most lucrative and competitive engineering programs in the entire united states and it just doesn’t feel like it at all when i’m stuck at home and my only connection to my professors, tas and other students and faculty is via a two-dimensional panel that only pertains to two out of five senses.

i think i might end up skipping summer quarter because i can’t continue like this. it feels a waste of time and effort and my energy reserves are quickly being depleted. distance learning is not for me and i just want to be back on campus after having that robbed from me for an entire year.

i got my vaccine. go get yours too. not only for yourself, but for others around you that are struggling in distance learning. and i will never forgive the frat dwellers who made this whole situation worse for us all.",rant

"rc student questions i just got accepted to the uw robinson center program as a freshman for 2021. i had some questions about the point of the rc in general.   
1) are students that take the rc program really ahead of their peers in high school? it seems that rc path is basically the same as running start. what is the point of taking rc if it doesn't even give the student an advantage on completing an undergrad program?  
2) rc students need to take 1 year of ""transition"" to achieve 105 credits and 5 quarters before being able to declare a major. i think this factors the required cadrs not completed in high school. is this normal for all uw freshman to need 105 credits before declaring a major? am i literally paying a year's worth of college for high school credits??  


3) i read that if you're not a direct admit, then there is no point going to the computer science route. as a rc student, i can't be counted as a direct admit because i can't even declare a major until after 1-2 years. how will being a rc student affect my chances?  


i am super confused and disillusioned at the prospect of this since rc never really described all the cons of the program. maybe i'm just being dumb but if everything i said above is true, then i don't understand the point of rc. i know that uw is a really good computer science school, but i don't see the advantages of rc over running start, or just finishing 2 years and applying to mit or stanford. any help is appreciated! i feel so lost.",advice

i'm a direct admit to the paul allen school, but i often feel like they gave me that because of how well my essay was written and how i outlined the challenges i've had to go through as someone with what could be classified as a mental disorder. and while i am so grateful for the opportunity, i can't help but feel like it's something i'll really have to live up to.

and i come from a household that was quite strict on the amount of screen time i was allotted because of some facebook mom post from 2011 about how kids with autism need screen time limits that extend into teenage years instead of letting said kids be more independent as they get older. needless to say i wasn't really allowed to do programming until recently and i feel way behind my peers in that regard. i didn't know what merge sort, binary trees, or binary search was before i took this course.

that and i was diagnosed with adhd quite late in life and didn't get help for it until recently, so that made for some pretty fun (not) times.

compounded with distance learning and i feel like i'm at a sore, sore disadvantage. it feels like i'm absorbing half as much as what i need to for my degree and that stuff isn't being retained. this ain't just in cs, it's in all my classes. being at home gets me quite disorganised and as such i often fall behind or have to cut corners to stay afloat and it makes me feel quite guilty that i even have to do that because in order for me to really understand stuff i need to be in an actual classroom setting. 

yeah i'm definitely a bit upset at my situation and i'm probably gonna take summer quarter off to recoup before we can go back to school in the fall. can't change how i was raised, but i can change how i go forward, and i'm probably gonna remember this for the rest of my life.",rant

* added natural sciences, environmental, and informatics majors. but, i'm pretty sure the [data](https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) is outdated, so check before using.

* updated [degree course lists](https://github.com/awu43/prereq-flow-degrees) with course names.

what's still missing:

* grouping — unfortunately, the library i'm using to generate the graphs doesn't support grouping at the moment so there's no easy way to represent a condition like ""10 credits from approved electives"".

* dark mode — it would be nice to have, but fiddling around with colors isn't something i enjoy at all, so probably not going to happen anytime soon.",academics

"help! looking to rent in the fall but reading terrible reviews of apartments and freaking out hey everyone, so i (23f, grad student at uw) will be moving to udistrict on september 1st and i am looking for a 2 bedroom apartment to share with my roommate. we had narrowed it down to 2 places called college place apartments or campus view apartments. i just thought to check reviews before picking one to begin the application process for and they are appalling.

both apartments are located on the west of campus which seems to be rife with theft, crimes, break-ins, and homeless people? reviews are either really good (like, 5-star good which seem kind of fake or written by management, i don't know what to believe) or they're horrid, lambasting every feature of the apartment. i couldn't find any other apartment with a decent rating in a 0.75 mile radius of the campus either. is this the reality of off-campus housing in seattle? i have night classes and need to be within walking distance (<1mi) because i don't have a car.

i guess i am looking for any advice from previous renters who have stayed at these places/similar ones, any recommendations for places you liked/approve of, and any advice in general about the questions to ask landlords before applying and leasing from them. are there any dependable crowd-sourced platforms where i can know more about these places before i rent? thanks in advance!",advice

"dreading the possibility of online not to sound dramatic, but i’m so scared that we will go online again and i’ll finish my bachelors degree with nothing to show for beside the degree itself. 

for some background, i went to community college for my first two years of college. the pandemic started as i was finishing my last year at cc. so last year i attended uw completely online and have never been in a uw building while having finished my junior year here. considering i spent all of cc just going to school and working my ass off, ifs not like my cv accomplishments are long. the school i went two only had two clubs as well and neither of them were geared toward me.

i came into junior year thinking i’d make connections and maybe even find a mentor because i really don’t know what i’m doing and can use the nuanced advice the internet or my family can’t give. ofc being online (and depressed- i’ll admit if i had more energy i could have tried harder to make these connections but i was focusing on my gpa and being alive) i made zero connections with clubs, professors, or students. 

this has put me in a position to try and make up for the last year and my lack of anything before that. i need to do research, figure out multiple things regarding grad school, and also connect with at least three professors to a point they would confidently write me letters of recommendation. 

if we go online i’m truly scared i will learn nothing or accomplish nothing outside of a classroom setting. this makes me afraid because i know nothing about professional life or anything substantive about grad school and this last year of college is essentially my only opportunity to figure it out.",rant

"an open letter the university of washington the university of washington has condemned me and other disabled students with immune deficiency, as well as their families. every 12 hours i take two medications to prevent my body from recognizing foreign solid organs that i received as part of a transplant. because of this, i am more susceptible to covid-19 and other infectious diseases, something i have known for a long time. what many don’t know is that an additional consequence of these medications is reduced vaccine efficacy. i have received two doses, a booster, and have had covid-19, and i still lack the antibodies to fight the disease.

the university of washington, like many other universities across the country, has opted for in-person learning this fall. most students and faculty are eager for the opportunity to be back on campus. however, the harsh reality for some is that the options provided by the university are subpar, dangerous, and are directly against access to learning for all students. i know i am not the only student with an immune deficiency, and i know that there are students with family members who are immune deficient.

the options before myself, as presented by the drs, are as follows: hope that professors are willing to alter their course structures significantly to accommodate a single student, take less courses, request accommodations through the drs which they have stated will be extremely limited and hard to acquire, or take the quarter off. most of these place undue stress on students and instructors, both emotionally as well as financially.

with little over a month until the beginning of fall quarter, myself and my living partner have had no access to resources to protect ourselves from covid-19 on campus. i have options, as listed above, however, my partner  — who sleeps next to me — has been told that there are no options for them, because they have no disability, making what little accommodations provided to myself useless so long as my partner must return to in-person learning.

i thank all the professors and advisors who’ve been corresponding with my partner and i this summer, trying to help in any way possible, and informing us that the university refuses to provide professors with guidance and resources for specific cases. this is the direct responsibility of the university, to provide guidance for student and faculty guidance, and reassurances that they will support all types of learning to guarantee that students can become educated in the safest and most effective way possible.

so while summer winds its way to a close and we continue to sit at home keeping our minds and bodies as active in any safe manner possible, the fall looms with unanswered questions, anxiety about more than assignments, and a sadness that the university i was once so proud to be a part of has become such a risk.

"[u-pass] remember to tap on and tap off on light rail for some students who use the light rail in wa for the first time, please remember to tap on before you board the train, and tap off after you leave the train.

if you fail to tap on before you board the train, when a fare enforcement officer comes around to check that you paid your fare,  **you might run the risk of a $124 citation.**

# if you’re transferring to a bus or another train? 

# should you still tap off? 

**yes!** if you get off a link train without tapping your u-pass, when you tap your u-pass to get on another train, the reader will actually register that as a tap off. if a fare enforcement officer checks your card now, it will show that you haven’t tapped on for your second train. there’s that citation risk **of $124** again.

here is what you should do:

1. tap on before boarding any transit vehicle using your u-pass.
2. if you’re riding on link light rail or a sounder train, tap off at the end of your ride.
3. if you’re transferring, just follow those steps again on the next leg of your trip. that orca technology inside your husky card will be able to tell that you’re transferring. it’s that smart!

another reason for tapping on and tapping off your husky card is to **keep the cost down** for everyone. if you fail to tap off and are charged for a more expensive trip than the one you took, the u-pass program has to pay the difference.

for example, if a u-pass member takes a ride downtown from uw station to do some shopping, the cost of the trip should be about $2.50. but if the u-pass member doesn’t tap off, the program is charged about $3.25.

my main question is, what should i do in this situation? i tried not engaging with him but he seemed intent on following me. this is my first time living in a city, i’m from oos too. sorry if this post was a little confusing, i’m a little rattled right now.",student life

"five days for lander hall packages. i feel like an asshole for complaining about this, since there's obviously a low amount of workers, but how the hell is lander desk at a 5 day waiting period for package processing? i understand covid has impacted how everyone works and has created a deficit of workers, but 5 days, especially after already waiting for a package to ship and arrive, is too much. i have books and materials that i need for classes that are physically inside of the building, but need to be processed. i have medicine that, thankfully, isn't super required for me to take, in one of my packages. i understand a 1 or 2 day wait, especially in these times, but how was the ball dropped \*this\* hard? this campus, with the exception of last year, usually deals with the same influx of student every year, each student ordering their own packages. i'm a freshman this year, so i don' t have any insight on how this has gone in previous years, but was it always this bad? i feel like there'd be a better system in place for this since it had to be expected.",rant
"i hate myself.. i tried everything to blend into the campus; i even joined the club to break out of comfort zone and wrong stereotypes that i had against uw. and i did try counselings, and that didn't go too well i guess.. but then i realized it was more about..how i'm seen and the fact that i can't be myself, and how being myself is pretty pathetic when i walk and meet people around here. 

i look absolutely terrible, wasted my time, and i feel everything is just too late to do something. i'm too old to be friends with people, and i hate that how i'm rushing everything for campus life, also how i'm still bad at socializing. 

i know that it's not just me who has similar problem, or everyone just don't care but it's been to the point that i feel like i'm walking to the empty and cold plain that has nobody out there. it's painful to just walk around because i keep comparing myself to everyone and looking at me just gives a sense of deprivation. 

long story short, i'm not good enough. i even hate that i am thinking about this even it doesn't matter. i hate that i have to be sad over being lonely. and i hate that i can't be proud of myself even if i've done some of good things. i act positive characteristics in front of people, but in fact, i guess nothing has gotten better. even if i try not to look at these things, i can't help it anymore. 

i predicted that i'd be crying at campus all day when i go back to in-person, but i guess it did become the reality.. i don't even know if i want to be happy. i just think the concept of success already left me a while ago, but at least i don't want to feel like i'm below average person. 
maybe i am below average for feeling like this and writing a long message, but i'm sick and tired of being depressed every single time when i think about here. 
i just want to feel neutral and feel normal about being myself, yet here i am feeling like shit.. 

please don't call a cops on this post if you deeply care. someone called a cops to my house over a rant before and my families blamed me for being mentally struggling and how stressful of experience it was. i know it is a part of how people care but i don't want that in this particular way. it threatens and intimidates my whole household, which disrupts the peace. i don't want to be considered a burden any more than i already am and feel like. i'd much appreciate you reaching out to me than calling a cops to my house.",rant

after hours on hold, i finally got through to an apathetic customer service representative who assured me the charge was only temporary, that my payment didn't go through, and that he would give me two weeks of free aleks (yay!). well, the charge didn't go away. the $70 is very much gone from my bank account while my aleks subscription expires next week. furthermore, my phone number seems to have been blacklisted as they no longer take my calls.",rant

"let's have a serious discussion - what will be the necessary conditions for covid to no longer impact our daily lives? many parts of the country have already begun a transition back to normal, but i have observed the state of washington, and apparently the students at uw, are very resistant to this transition. there has been this delta scare that has gone on now for a while, which has appeared to keep us in a perpetual loop of restrictions. 

what i want to address today, is what exactly the road to 'normalcy' will look like. there seems to be no mention of when the mask mandate will be lifted, or what the actual plan is for resolving our current state of affairs. regarding vaccines, a strong majority of people are **already fully vaccinated**. the only people that aren't are:

* those that are immunocompromised - this portion of the population is not going anywhere, there will always be people with weakened immune system and they will always be unfortunately over-susceptible to a **wide array of illnesses**, not just covid.

* those that are resisting getting vaccinated for their own moral or religious reasons - at the end of the day, there isn't much you can do about people who are delusional without going against their civil liberties and forcing them to do something against their will (which we need to ask ourselves, can we really resort to that?)

so as we have logically established, these two groups are not going anywhere, and by the way, neither are viral variants. viruses adapt the same way any organic system would, and there will **always be** new mutations to deal with. 

-------------------

also, before you tell me to ""suck it up and wear a mask"", i would like to point out that current restrictions extend way beyond just mask wearing:

* many events (at least in my experience) that would normally be held in-person have still been virtualized, taking the human element and ability to meet other people out of them, despite the fact that a return to classes has been allowed. 

* eating food in any area that is not an 'established common area' like the hub is disallowed (this doesn't even make any sense to me, if we have allowed people to eat maskless at the hub, why not in other indoor areas?)

* currently you are not allowed to even drink coffee during classes (only water) due to having to pull down your mask to do so.

* everyone must continue to wear masks even when inside gyms or fitness centers, and if you are engaging in a particularly aerobic task such as treadmill running, the issues with wearing a mask while doing so can range from miserable to straight up dangerous (asphyxiation). 

* i am not even sure why, but it seems like a lot of the students here feel compelled to wear their masks even when walking outside - i personally don't and i constantly feel like i am being stared at as if i am some sort of anti-vaxxer...

------------------

so now, to conclude, if all of these things have now reached a point of 'static equilibrium' and we still have all of these restrictions placed on us, i question how exactly we can ever contemplate the idea of returning back to some notion of normal. now i ask all of you, what do you envision the roadmap might look like, or do you believe we should permanently live our lives as we are now? and please, stick to intelligent discussion.",rant

i followed a couple of youtubers, and i just found out that many of them didn’t attend college but still earned a great deal of money. what’s more important is that they enjoy what they are doing. whenever i compare my life to theirs, i feel even more lost. i feel like they are successful because they know what they are doing, and they enjoy it while earning money.

"how much of a “college experience” can be had living near campus i despise commuting. i commuted this year for financial reasons and wish i didn’t have to. i never have time to finish homework. my only social interaction with uw students was through instagram pages or study groups, and even then, i would leave campus with most of my work unfinished and come home too tired to finish it. i have no time to attend club meetings either. i want to live on or near campus but i am debating whether to dorm or live in a studio. i don’t know anyone who is looking for a roommate for one thing. for another i want to have some semblence of a traditional college experience. i was “homeschooled” from k-12 at a hybrid parent/school system teaching resource center, and never got to develop socially as i would have in a normal school, as it was next to impossible to be anywhere without your parent or someone elses breathing down your back. most people there were neurodivergent (i am as well, but an environment of 100% nds is… something) or religiously fanatic, and that didn’t help things. i made the mistake of doing running start. i spent three years only to come out with 60 relevant credits, no breathing room for electives to fill the gaps between courses at uw, a social environment worse than high school, and crippled mental health. (i never saw my mental health improve faster than the period immediately after i left community college) i am technically a junior but in standing i am a sophomore. i desperately want to meet people, attend a few parties, and feel like i am part of my university community. at the same time i recognize that hfs provides pretty piss poor value for money, and that a studio would be substantially cheaper than living on campus. there are plenty of options near uw, and it would allow me to stay on campus to work longer, and attend club meetings. it would give me much more privacy and comfort as well.

now, normally i would be fine with this. but, i've had a number of groups in the past where group members just don't check the canvas discussions posts regularly enough to do group work by it. so, i sent out emails to start things going, off canvas. i made a reply on the canvas discussion just to let people know i sent out an email in case someone happened to check the group page before seeing the email. most members have responded to the email and would prefer text/zoom to work on the assignment. i went back to the canvas discussion just to check it and the prof replied to me and again requested that group communication *only* take place on canvas.

"man i'm definitely not ready for the in person again... last year and half of doing quarantine was pretty hellish; i was getting into my thoughts all day and there was no one that was on by my side at that time, and i still feel like there isn't. i know i complain about something trivial for a school life but i have nowhere to stay associated; i tried clubs, networking, and everything that i could to socialize but nothing really worked out. 

and so i've been writing posts this subreddit for a bit and it got me delusional about how everyone around myself hated me. i do not believe in this anymore but somehow i felt that there was a wall between myself and expectations, the level of uw students. it was really tough time to actually get  myself out of deep irrational thoughts that was eating me as a whole. thankfully, the attempt to be part of social circle throughout the entire fall quarter sort of helped me to get out of this loophole although i didn't get anything out of it which is now causing another problem. 

now this winter quarter is kinda weird because about half of your class were done online and you now have to go back right after. i have mixed feelings towards this situation; i will be more involved in class and actually get to know people, but then i consistently be thinking that no one wants me anywhere. 

part of what got me super sad in fall quarter is that i'm all lonely yet others seem super happy or actually having a campus life, yet i'm here feeling like outsider without making an actual progress. so this is why i tried to join a club and everything to make a meaningful progress, but really i wasn't getting anywhere. it felt cold. and i still feel this place is cold and i'm somewhat hated. 

i'm scared of going back to in person just to realize how incapable i am of doing anything that anyone can do and be seen as someone inferior. i know you be thinking i'm a child or something, but it seems like i have ultimately made 0 change in myself. i don't even know where to start to make friends anymore or just what to do to make the school life better when i'm graduating in 5 months; i tried everything, i still am trying, trying to make the best out of the school but i'm still shitty group member at group project, no one wants me anywhere,  and i'm a pathetic shit who keeps thinking about these things.

"[fundraiser] my friend was almost killed. would you consider donating to his gofundme? hey y'all,

my friend huckleberry kid was assaulted on january 5th at the dockside cannabis in shoreline. two men robbed the store armed with guns and opened fire as he went to check their ids at the door. he was hit in the arm, leg, and torso, suffering nerve damage to his hand and foot and punctures to his liver, colon and stomach. we're beginning the process of getting him home; he'll be living with me, his girlfriend, and some other friends. he's a good man, the kind that is giving, warm, and safe to be you around. there isn't anyone less deserving of this happening to them.

this is going to be a long road, and we'd appreciate some help to cover huck's expenses - just basic costs will be around $75k this year between rent, utilities, food, and therapy. all of us are at uw or recent grads, so time and money are tight. if you have the capacity to donate, thank you. if you can't, that's totally ok. we'd appreciate if you could share this on your socials to get better visibility.

"district market out of red bulls i started college a devoted connoisseur of tea. a caffeine boost for me meant going crazy with some earl grey instead of my usual green tea. but soon the stress of weed-out classes and part time work at a fast food restaurant piled on to me. simply put, i was exhausted. around early november i was finally lured across the border into coffee consumption like a waterfront seagull is baited by an ivar's french fry. this was my gateway drug. what started as one cup before my math 125 lecture soon became three per day. then four. then five. as i integrated my way into finals season, i once again found myself drudging my way through the day in a cloudy stupor of apathy and mental exhaustion. i needed something new. 

with over $500 still left on my dining account, i stumbled into the district market one saturday morning looking for something absurd to buy in bulk. i considered potatoes and condoms, but soon realized both would sit around unused on the floor of my dorm, a stark reminder of my shortcomings this quarter. but then i saw them. shiny metal cylinders, glistening erotically under the florescent lighting of the dm - their red, white and blue logo filling me with a patriotic romanticism i hadn't felt since jay inslee secured his third term as governor. i needed them. i needed them all.

frantically filling a basket with as many as i could carry, i paraded my red bull bounty to the cashier with a new-found optimism. i was going to make it through the quarter.

as finals came and went, i jittered and twitched through my days with ease. while occasionally the dm would run out of my fix, i had a large enough stockpile under my bed to give me an illusion of sustainability. simply put, i thought i was invincible. and i got complacent. over the last few weeks, i decided to dip into my surplus, put off a restock until after midterms. two days ago i found myself with only 10 bulls to my name. i quickly marched over to the district market for a resupply mission. upon entering, my stomach folded itself into a klein bottle. the entire shelf was empty. 

in desperation, i returned yesterday. nothing. and again this morning. nothing. i sit here now sipping my very last red bull and typing this short rant out of desperation. but also as a warning to my fellow huskies. please help.",rant

"[rant] stop throwing glass from balconies/windows into busy roads and sidewalks i was walking my dog last night pretty late and some “men” from an unnamed frat were throwing multiple glass bottles from their balcony right onto ne 45th. we had to abruptly turn down another street to avoid getting glass thrown at us. if that had been thrown at my dog, me, or my car, i would have been so upset. today there are a bunch of glass shards in the road. hoping for the best for any cyclists who have to use that road. i generally don’t consider calling the cops on drunk people doing drunk things (that don’t harm others), but i was really close on this one. 

why do people do stuff like this? perhaps i’m just old and lame (late 20s), but this particular thing made me very upset.

the most they would have done to those kids was give them a stern warning. if the folks were black, they could have been harassed, beaten or killed.

"uw ms in data science (msds): a review i have not found many places to review the uw masters in data science program on the internet, so figured it might belong here. note: msds during covid may not be what it once was or what it might be in the future.

if you majored in cse at the uw and expect the same level of quality in your masters do not apply to msds. the program has largely **not** met expectations and many of my peers feel the same way. 

teaching: boring, slow, with (sometimes) less qualified professors.  
expecting this program to be connected to cse uw i imagined some overlap between the cse professors and data classes, this was not the case. i understand that uw cse has its own masters, however many professors dont even come from uw itself, with the ones that do coming from the stats and biostats departments. many of the lectures i experienced were 4 hour slogs in which the msds discord was alight with people joking to pass the time and planning where they were going to get dinner. some even expressed that they teach themselves most topics through khan academy...   
for a major which is part stats and part computer science this program does not bring enough computer science faculty onboard, considering it is attached to the uw name.

community: vibrant, fun, interesting  
on the upside, msds has amazing cohorts, people are excited to join and network but also plan fun nights out. something that surprised me when i joined was that there were only around 5 people actually from uw in the program, with many coming from overseas or out of state. generally nothing bad to say about the students, all of them are bright and passionate.

i dont want to spend time slandering uw msds or its faculty, i wish this review only to point out the discrepancy between uw's amazing cse department and what i feel to be an underdeveloped data science program. uw msds attaches itself heavily to the uw name but the courses dont have any uw cse professors or use the same cse buildings for lectures, in reality the only connected cse event we have are the recruiting fairs, which have largely been decimated by covid. 

i hope this review becomes useless when uw decides to invest in its msds program more but i want masters students to know what they are paying for when deciding to give up 35k in tuition.

"i’m tired of failing but if i don’t fix this i’m throwing in the towel on life transfer student/junior/history department 

i don’t know where to start with any of this other than to say i feel hollow and like a sham.

i know i’m better than all of this but i just don’t know how i got here. i used to be so passionate and energetic. i was a mediocre high school student but really took off in speech & debate. i received good grades at my first college and did decent through the first part of the pandemic but everything changed after i left campus and then left my parent’s house to live on my own.

i lived with sociopaths, meth-heads and dying old people. i’ve slept in a nook in the wall, i’ve slept in the cold, i’ve gone to sleep hungry.

i’ve dealt with both bipolar and adhd throughout my life and while i’m now medicated, and living in a safe environment with some close friends i still can’t fucking make it work.

through most of all of this i’ve been working at a grocery store and i think it’s eating away at my soul. the crazy people, the anti-vax/anti-mask crowd, snooty and condescending upper class white people, the incompetent management and the physically-intensive labor have all been draining on me. 

but i need to pay rent and eat food (financial aid luckily covers my tuition). and those are getting more and more expensive over time it seems.

my transcript since last winter has been abysmal. a couple xs, one ns, and one whole quarter just absolutely failed (last quarter). i’ve been able to discuss a lot of my struggles and get some leeway and really appreciated assistance from advisors and counselors to be able to continue this quarter. but i just can’t seem to find the energy or patience or even mental well-being to study anymore it seems. i just lay in bed a lot of the time or just sleep because i’m so tired and depressed and i feel almost removed from my surroundings and like there’s thick barrier between me and the world right in front of me. i cry, i sleep, i stare into nothingness. it’s so tragic because i’m such a curious and fairly learned person in the subjects i study and have a yearning to go on to more, complete research and finish well but why can’t i seem to actually do any of it? it’s like i keep getting back on the horse only to fall right off.

i resent all of this because i continue to doubt myself and feel like i’m not actually equipped or intelligent enough to be here. 

i feel like an absolute failure and i think i want to just give up. not just school but i mean everything.

i write this with the second exam due for a class tomorrow when i haven’t even done the first or attended a lecture since the first day and it seems like the professor has a strict exam policy and allows no make-ups without medical or university excuse. i’m already on academic probation from my previous quarters.

i’m tired of failing and i know i’m better than this but i don’t know what to do.

i feel like my entire life is on the brink of falling apart and i just might throw myself into the lake. i’ll never reach my goals and all of this feels like a lofty escapade i was never cut out for because i’m lazy and stupid and sad.

"uw or in-state? hello y'all! i was recently accepted by the uw as a pre-sciences major. i have kind of a debate in my head right now though because of it. while uw is my top choice and i would absolutely love to go (i fell in love with the school and seattle as a whole when i visited), i'm coming from colorado with little financial aid and because of how majors work i can't be sure if i'd be able to get into a more lucrative major later on to justify the price. meanwhile i am much more likely to get into my in state school (cu boulder) with better prospects in terms of price and major. so ultimately i'm torn between staying in state and playing it safe or going to uw and risking more but potentially having a better, more satisfying, and more passionate experience that could stay with me for a long time. my question is: if i get into my in state school with the major i applied for, should i still go to uw regardless of the potential risk to have a more satisfying college experience or should i just stay here? and i suppose a side question would be is it possible to still get into a decently lucrative/popular major at uw as a ""pre-whatever"" admit without having to push yourself to the limits? thank you for any advice that you all may give and if i end up choosing uw i hope to have a fantastic college experience with you :)",advice

"i have a lot of questionssss [cs/ce freshman reject looking to transfer as cc student] i recently got waitlisted as a freshman applicant to uw (probably because i had cs and ce in my top 2 preferred majors). i tried appealing but that got denied as well so i’m looking to transfer from the cc i’m
 attending for running start (cascadia college). in combination with credits transferred from dual-enrollment evcc classes, i have 91 credits and a 3.969 gpa. however, i expect that the evcc credits won’t transfer since they were low-level classes (intro to physics, english, and some european history credits) so i plan on taking a few more classes before transferring.  i had a few questions though. 

1. how long do i have to wait before i can apply as a transfer? i’ve heard different answers from the people i’ve asked. an advisor said 2 semesters after i graduate while some other people (and the uw website) say i can transfer any time after summer quarter. is it different for people who applied as freshman? do we have to wait a bit longer? 

2.  what extracurriculars do you guys recommend me doing? right now i am working on creating a digital replica of my house using cad software. by the time i apply i plan on making some 3d worlds that anyone can visit in vrchat (its a personal hobby of mine). i am also a council member at the engineering club at my school. i also plan on making some vr haptic gloves this summer to mess around with. should i work on trying to get some more ecs? the club president is leaving soon so i might be able to take that spot or take vp. 

3. to people who have successfully transferred into cs/engineering, what was your gpa , what college did you go to, and how were your extracurriculars? i’ve heard that bellevue college tends to get more students into uw but i’m a bit late in my degree to transfer. still could if it gives enough of an advantage.

 my academic record is not nearly as competitive as i would have liked it to be, with a gpa of about 3.1, which is only that high because i managed to yank it from a 2.0 by going into running start and doing extremely, extremely well for the past two years.

idk it feels like everyone else around me has their ish together while im over here contemplating whether or not this major is right for me. i might have to graduate a year later which, ok, it is what it is, but it's something that i dread thinking about since i feel like i should get this all in 4 years max. idk i'm just emotionally all over the place yet i also feel numb like i've held back crying again the whole day and idk what to do... yeah im out of it lol",rant

"uw major system and registration master guide as we entering the second half of the spring quarter, lots of you may already committed to uw. **first of all, congratulations! i am very proud of you getting accepted by uw!** now i am going to give more insights on how the major system and registration at uw work. 

&#x200b;

# 1. major system

**1.1 types of majors** [all majors](http://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/list-of-undergraduate-majors/) at uw can be categorized into five levels:

**level 1 (open)**: you can declare the major ***anytime*** as long as the cumulative gpa is above 2.0.

* **level 2 (minimum requirements)**: you need to complete the required prerequisites with an overall gpa of 2.50 and higher, and the cumulative gpa is also 2.00 or higher.
* **level 3 (less selective)**: the least competitive type of capacity-constrained majors. in addition to the requirement on prerequisites, you have to complete additional application or essay prompts. ***majors at this level usually have an acceptance rate above 50%***.
* **level 4 (moderately selective)**: most of the stem majors at uw fall in this level, which ***the acceptance rate is less than 50% but above 20%***. very similar to level 3 majors, but you need to earn ***stellar grades (above 3.7)*** to guarantee the acceptance.
* **level 5 (most selective)**: for any majors with ***an acceptance rate under 20%, unless you have an extraordinary gpa (3.9+) with unique ps and cv, i would not suggest you wasting quarters to apply***. if you still wish to pursue similar paths, please try to get the prerequisites done so you can apply for level 3 or level 4 majors. 

&#x200b;

**1.2 some of the commonly applied or heard majors:**

* biology - level 3
* computer science/engineering - level 5
* applied mathematics - level 5
* engineering - level 3 or 4 (depends on your path)
* psychology - level 3 or 4 (vary by quarter)
* education (eco) - level 3 (4 if you're a sophomore)
* statistics - level 4
* mathematics - level 4
* english - level 2
* acms - level 5
* political science - level 2
* informatics - level 4 (vary by quarter)
* economics - level 3 or 4 (vary by quarter)
* any foster - level 4

&#x200b;

**1.3 tips on declaring majors:**

* if you're ***not*** dtm (direct-to-major) or dtc (direct-to-college) but ***dreaming for level 4 or 5 majors***, please have at least one level 1 or 2 major planned. undergraduate is your best time to explore different academic interests.
* if you come to uw with ***more than*** ***30 transfer credits*** (2 quarters equivalency), you're expected to declare a major ***by the winter quarter of your second year***. otherwise, a registration hold will be placed on your account until a major is declared, according to the [105-credit rule](https://registrar.washington.edu/registration/policies-procedures/).
* run your dars (**d**egree **a**udit and **r**eport **s**ystem) featured on myplan periodically to check your academic progress. when in doubt, do not hesitate to seek for help, even for level 1 or 2 majors.

&#x200b;

# 2. registration

in november, you will have your first registration at uw as an enrolled student. and the registration is always a pain to rant about. here i am providing some strategies on how to painlessly register for your classes.

&#x200b;

**2.1 your registration date**

you can see your registration for the upcoming quarter during week 4 of the current quarter on myuw. and your [registration date (winter 2023 as an example)](https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-priorwi23/) is based on your [class standing](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/undergraduate-class-standings/), **not year at uw**. if you don't pay attention, do not worry. you can simply look it up by typing on the searching bar on your browser:

https://registrar.washington.edu/priority-registration-dates-prior**\[quarter\]\[year\]**/

* \[quarter\]: **au - autumn**, **wi - winter**, **sp - spring, su - summer**
* \[year\]: **last 2 digits of the calendar year (e.g. 22 as 2022)**

&#x200b;

**2.2 registration periods:**

* period 1: friday of week 6 to sunday of week 8
* period 2: monday of week 9 to the last day before the upcoming quarter starts
* period 3: the first week of the upcoming quarter
* **note that the registration for period 2 and 3 starts at 00:00 midnight, not 06:00 am! for example, if period 1 registration for autumn 2022 is may 6th to june 19th, then period 2 registration starts at 00:00 on june 20th!**
* **incoming freshmen are registering for fall classes during the a&o, so please ignore the period 1 restrictions if autumn 2022 is your first quarter at uw.**

&#x200b;

**2.3 platform**

use **sln page** to register. myplan sometimes drive people crazy.

&#x200b;

**2.4 check the requirements & restrictions**

before the registration starts, please **check** whether you satisfied the requirements or not. the most common are:

* you need to be in certain majors to register during period 1, 2, or 3
* you need to a certain class standing to register during period 1, 2, or 3
* you need either 0.7 (d-), 1.7 (c-), 2.0 (c), 2.2 (c+), or 3.0 (b) to be eligible for advanced courses
* you need to be matriculated student **(45 uw credits)**

&#x200b;

**2.4.1 example (mgmt 402): major & class standing restrictions**

[mgmt 402 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/eovpphiqtsv81.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9fc67e2b1842047fe1df1da7f0cae871037dd2)

to be eligible for mgmt 402, you need:

* have 90 or more total credits earned (junior status)
* admitted to foster, or you must wait until june 20th or your registration date

&#x200b;

**2.4.2 example (math 125): major & class & prereq restrictions**

[math 125 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/5484bjvkvsv81.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=300ed8a17e907f0a741fc264f5fffd500982cefd)

[math 125 sln notes](https://preview.redd.it/t212eybnvsv81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=0605bcee18452dd2d35d88947995ff88e7380f75)

to be eligible for math 125, you need:

* finish \*math 124 or have equivalent ap/ib exam scores
* not in math, stat, or acms majors
* **the ""cancellation in effects"" means that if you ended up a 1.9 and lower on math 124, the registration system will remove you from math 125 when the grade is posted.**

\*math 124 has no prerequisite unless you took math 120 (need 2.5+).

i don't live very close to memos so if someone wants to volunteer their place (or knows of a place?) for a staging area that'd be dope. sounds like a bad idea but the r/udub party a few years ago was fine for the most part. or we can just all meet at a bar or something since that has less potential for things to go sideways, it'll just be more expensive. i don't really get drunk that often so idk what the cool kids do, open to ideas about how to make this not lame.",student life

"the futurist society  

hello everyone!

i've created a national student club called the futurist society where we discuss future trends and technologies. we discuss flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. we are building a wiki of many types of future tech as a resource for people looking to know more about technology. we also have plans to start doing projects as our organization gets more established. we also have guest talks from speakers who work in tech!

right now there is no chapter being formed at this school, but we are always looking for people to help us start new ones for the next school year! being one of our leaders could be a great opportunity in shaping your resume and in making connections! we also welcome anyone who just wants to join for our discussions.

we have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! if you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

rent is 680 + util + wifi and there is rent concession for month of sept 2022 and aug 2023! meaning freeee rent!

2. how do you balance high school and college? are college classes in the evening, or do you skip part of the high school day in order to attend college classes?

while there is research and a case that race in physical descriptions is ineffective (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3120676) it does not take into account the environment of the investigation. i do not find descriptions provided by uwpd any more useful than 'a college aged person with average college height and average college build.' for this reason, i believe additional identifying attributes, in this setting, could be incredibly important to the success of an investigation and the safety of students. it is unfortunate uwpd does not feel like they can release racial details and chooses to undermine their own investigation at the expense of safety.",discussion

as a tenant myself, i'm not sure if my landlord is treating me fairly or if my expectations are unrealistic and so am curious about what others are up to and how effective/successful they've been. this is a [survey for current renters](https://forms.gle/y9wncfjgmhoywfmj9) to better understand what major challenges and solutions exist when it comes to renting residential rental properties. the first 25 people to respond will receive an amazon or starbucks gift card, my best practices and the results of this survey as a thank you. if you prefer to answer free-form, please feel free to do so in the comment thread below.

this survey will remain active from oct 31, 2022 until nov 15, 2022 after which i'll tally the votes and summarize its findings to share with the broader rental tenant community.

questions i'm hoping to get answered:

\- what types of property manager (e.g. owner/operator, on-site property manager, off-site property manager) have you worked with in the past?

\- what is your top goal as a renter (e.g. temp, long-term, rent to buy eventually, get government funding)

\- what are your most resource-intensive/painful/urgent challenges as a tenant?

\- what workarounds/solutions do you currently leverage to mitigate against your top challenges noted above?

\- on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), how satisfied are you with the current workarounds/solutions listed above? why?

doubting my capabilities… this is an ugly really pathetic post so plz scroll away. i registered for math 120 today bc i considered switching from the ba to the bs in my major but i cried all day about it (still crying tbh) and ended up dropping it after four hours. i feel so stupid. math has always been super hard for me and i felt like shit taking the self placement test and only getting 3 questions right. then i was looking at the course content and i go so overwhelmed. but i feel dumb for being so upset about it. the bs is obviously a better pathway for what i want to do after i graduate but i can’t bring myself to even try math 120. i’m too scared. i feel like a failure and i didn’t even fail anything. if i go through with math 120 i have to take 124 after and that makes me feel even worse. idk today was just so awful and i feel like a total loser who doesn’t even belong at this school.,rant

"regrets of uw under covid hindsight’s 20/20… part of the reason i chose uw was that so few people from my state go here - afaik there’s literally only one other student in the entire university rn from my city. i felt like i needed some space to figure myself out.

now i’m in my senior year and it’s registering that i only have 1 person i’ve met here that i can picture having regular contact with in a year’s time. i’ve only got 2, maybe 3 people here i feel comfortable calling my friends. going through the pandemic at uw really murdered my social life. 

i know that lost friendships over the lockdowns was a common gripe, but i haven’t been able to compensate. i like the folks in my rsos, but no one in either really clicks with me. i try to make friends in class, but that almost always goes nowhere. honestly how does anyone manage to get to know their classmates in the span of a quarter????? it’s so hard to get a bearing on people in this town, takes forever to actually get comfortable around someone. 

in the past three years it seems like the only social situation where i felt like i belonged was when i went solo to a tiny niche concert - fairly certain i was the only student there.

i’ll miss the cozy coffee shops and the greenery, but i think i just want to move home. i’d rather be alone in a place where i understand the people.

"hfs staffing explained hello all! i've seen a lot of posts asking about the staffing problems with on-campus dining lately and i did a bit of inside research on the subject. here is what i gathered:

as many forum posts have claimed before, the union requires that hfs fill a certain number of full-time positions before giving hours to students. this is where the staffing issue comes from. there are more than enough students, but the pay that hfs offers for ft is too low to keep these positions staffed, and the school is not allowed to supplement them with pt.

tl;dr: yes, this is true.

background: currently, i work at a restaurant making almost double the base salary for retail lead at an hfs position (so in theory i have plenty of bargaining power). more specifics about their retail lead position: it is a required 40 hrs/week with no schedule flexibility, pretty basic (bare minimum imo) benefits, you don't get to choose which location (even from the ones hiring, although they do take preferences into account). at least compared to my current job, none of this is very appealing. i applied for this retail lead position to check it out and received my offer a few months ago.

starting salary is $3,260 - $3,665 ($21.14/hr) for the rl job. the starting pay for new hires (not leads, just team members) including tips at my current job is $23.75, plus schedule and location flexibility and similar benefits. i was offered the upper end of the pay scale. when i explained to hfs that this rate isn't competitive, they told me the wfse union establishes these rates and that is the highest they are allowed to offer. i then called the wfse union to confirm and the rep told me yes, unless the school is having, and i quote, ""trouble hiring people,"" they are required to only offer pay within this range. no lower, but also no higher.

so, i have no idea how the school wedged themselves into an agreement where they can't offer anything higher than a certain rate. unions are supposed to benefit employees and so it seems like somebody in this situation is being predatory to have a pay cap like this (just my theory!). however, from the representative's ""trouble hiring people"" comment, it seems to me that either hfs has not gotten the message or has not communicated the message that their students do indeed feel like they are having trouble hiring people to stay staffed.

the only thing i can think of is if everyone keep complaining! on days when half of the restaurants are closed, or when you go to the hub an hour too late to get food, make a stink about it. raise your voice (not literally at the employees duh), send hfs an email or something, i don't know.",student life

"am i crazy or is the timing of the classes this quarter sh*t? am i the only one getting frustrated with classes overlapping? i noticed that there are more classes now that starts at xx:00 (9:00, 10:00, 3:00, etc). before, i only see xx:30 classes (12:30, 3:30, etc) which i thought made sense because it prevents overlap for some classes and allows more options for classes to take.

there's a class that i want to take with the time 12:30-1:20 but one of my class has the time 1:00-2:20. 

wouldn't it be more convenient if they just stick to making all the classes start at xx:30? i'm so confused on how they decide timing of classes.",rant
"pre recorded lectures i think that pre recorded lectures should be included in the hours/credits count for a course. yes, we may only be in class for an hour three days a week, but they make us watch an hour+ of pre lectures for each day of in person class. that doubles the minimum amount of time we are required to be watching/engaging with the class, and thus a three hour class becomes about an 8 hour class, and yet they only give three credits? bs.",rant
"participation oriented lecture classes that force you to talk to people are truly evil i'm in this class that's graded 80% on exams and 20% on in-class participation, which already feels fucking criminal. it's an absolute nightmare for me because 80% of my grade depends on my dog shit memory, and the other 20% requires me to answer polleverywhere questions correctly (which also sucks because the internet connection has been terrible for me recently and my cell service doesn't reach the lecture hall well, so if the wifi is acting up, i just miss the question). the real issue for me is that over and over again throughout the class, we're supposed to be discussing concepts with our neighbors. i understand my professors point that it helps us to understand the content more, but as an autistic person with severe social anxiety, it feels like an exercise in public humiliation.

talking to strangers makes me feel uncomfortable, but at uw, it's extra bad. at least in my classes, i notice things are extremely homogenous, and i tend to stand out a little because i dress pretty differently from the vast majority of people around me. it already puts me on edge when i turn to talk to the person next to me and they look at me like i'm a fucking alien, so the anxiety of potentially saying the wrong thing/answer is really intense. however, if i don't talk to anyone, then one of the ""peer facilitators"" will come up to do the discussion with me. it feels really embarrassing to have tas step in because i have nobody to talk to, and just makes everything worse. i know they're just trying to be helpful and have good intentions, but after it happened to me a couple times today, i started crying. if it were up to me, i'd never go to the class and just watch panopto recordings, but because of the grading and the fact that i don't feel confident about my future exam scores, i have to go regardless.

i'm mostly just here to rant because i'm frustrated, but also would love to know if anyone else hates this sort of class so i can perhaps feel less embarrassed about how stressful it is for me.",rant

hey guys,

ik there are already a few posts abt transferring from uw bothell to seattle. but i just wanted some input from y’all.

so a lil background: im currently a freshman at uwb(sophomore credit-wise), and am currently working towards completing my prereqs for computer engineering. im really interested in informatics at seattle, specifically the data science stream. this is because of a couple of reasons: 
1. ive taken a couple of data science courses(outside school) that have rlly interested me in the field. i also plan on doing some small projects in the mere future.
2. the campus and college life, or rather the absence of it at uwb.
3. ive just started taking a class at seattle(cross-campus) and i love it✅

by the time i apply (sep 2023) my gpa should be around a 3.75 and i would about 70ish credits as im also taking summer classes. i kinda am already done with info prereqs too.

please lmk what y’all think abt my honest chances of transferring 👍, and if y’all have suggestions.",admissions

"uw students, make me hate uw long story short, i'm a wa resident, uw has been my dream school for a long time, got waitlisted and devastated. however, i got into ucla cs, ga tech cs , and uiuc cs as an oos student so i got the academic validation that i am definitely not dumb (like i thought i am after being waitlisted). i won't be attending those schools though since i'm broke and they gave me like no aid at all (super low-income, single-mother household so i don't want to be a burden). ended up deciding that cc would be the best choice for me (financially wise and i can still transfer after 2 years) and since then have moved on from uw.

however, uw came back yesterday and told me that they have accepted me from the waitlist, but they offer me their pre-science major pathway. i know that community college is definitely the better option from all the reddit posts i've seen, and i should make my decision logically instead of emotionally, but my heart still begs me to choose uw since it was and still my dream school. so please you guys, give me advices, experiences, and if possible, make me hate uw (well, for now).

"questions about nordheim court + what essentials to bring before moving onto campus hello! so i'm a master's student looking to move into nordheim this fall, if all goes well. 

now before i do, i wanted to ask a few questions about the apartment i'd be moving into and stuff related to that. i've never lived alone before, or in a central us city, so pardon me if any of my questions are dumb or anything lol.

first, how is it like living in nordheim court? is it quiet-ish? is there anything i should know/be wary of before moving in? 

also, i know the walk to campus is kinda uphill, but how bad is it? if i want to catch a bus that isn't full, what time should i aim to leave? 

how safe is the area around the apartment? are there any times where i could be out alone for a walk, for example, (as an *extremely* tiny 5 foot 100 lb woman)? should i bring mace/pepper spray/a taser just in case (i know i'll likely never need it but i think it'd make me feel safer anyway). 

next, how many cheap food+grocery options are there nearby lmao, it seems like everything good is on the ave 😭. does anyone go to costco from campus? is it an easy/quick bus ride without lots of changes? and are there any east asian household item stores nearby (like daiso/miniso/others)? 

what about travel from the airport? i see most people take the lightrail, but is it easy with luggage? especially if you have at least 2 suitcases? 

lastly, what are the most important things i should bring before moving onto campus, vs stuff i can buy later? my current list is: 

bed sets (idk if it should be twin xl or full but i'll see), pillows, basic toiletries, towels + washcloths, dishes and cutlery (like a pair of everything), clothes ofc, an umbrella(?), clothing iron?? some small pots and pans, some spices and rice and ramen, maybe an airfryer/toaster??? idk this feels like a lot but i'm also worried i'm missing stuff too.

also, do the apartments come with kettles at least, or literally anything else i can leave out? i'm already spending a lot to get a whole new wardrobe to move into a cold and rainy climate, along with all the other stuff, so i kinda want to keep it at a minimum cost 😭

* everybody needs to go to the bathroom for a #2 at some point. explore campus and see which bathroom gives you the maximum comfort for blowing up the toilet without the embarrassment
* the starbucks line at suzello is always so long and there's no order ahead. might as well as do order ahead for the starbucks on the ave and go pick it up
* join clubs if you can! you can always quit, its not a cult. you might find it fun. one of my regret is not being in a club
* if you wanna do research, start emailing profs early. don't overthink, just type up a short intro, attach resume, state motivation, and hit send. 
* if ur on a budget, sizzles and crunch has protein packed salad/rice bowls and its usually large enough you can split it between lunch and dinner
* if you go to the business building(s), them rich mfs are always holding some kind of event and it comes with free food/lunch. so watch for that. also good place to study and nap. 
* there are therapy dogs but the lines are long asf. not worth it.
* burke museum is free, go visit with friends

"sick-like people on campus let's be honest here. if you are sick and have symptoms of either the flu, the common cold, or maybe covid again, please stay home and get some rest. however, this is my personal opinion and you do not have to follow what i tell you to do, because you have your own situation on being sick and going to campus. if you do come to campus while having symptoms, please do west a mask. the previous labeled discussion about this was more of a rant instead of an actual discussion, since the poster complained about sick people in lecture halls, licking doorknobs (really? licking doorknobs is what sick people actually do? do i live in the same world as you?) and wishes yall the worst. do not mind his words, since if he was the one who was the sick person who comes to campus, he would wishes himself the worst. apologies in advance, but this is your logic. don't be upset at me when you created the option of possibility.

if you are just having coughing, coughing is not always a sick symptom. i have had asthma, so i did occasionally coughed, especially in cold weather. sneezing is also in the same category. you can sneeze if you have pollen in your nose or something along the sorts of that. if you're superstitious, sneezing would pair with someone talking about you. 

now for the people who would love for people who are sick to wear a mask or stay home, why would they listen to yall? now obviously, it would make sense for people who are sick to take preventive measures for themselves and other around them. but are there actual repercussions in not doing so? will they be slapped with a fine or a ticket for coming to lectures when they have symptoms of sickness? no, they would not. if you did that sort of option, obviously that would deter people who are sick coming on campus, but we all know here it's a stupid idea. or you can complain. here. on this subreddit. anonymously. i don't know you, nor you don't know me. social media is a wondrous thing, don't you think?

anyways, again, if you are sick and having sick like symptoms, please stay home and get some rest. if you want to come to class while having sick-like symptoms, try to please wear a mask. 

one more thing, being a victim to any situation is not trendy. the reason i'm stating this is because of a certain individual today stating that being a victim is trendy. you know who you are. i will not be saying who said this, since he deleted his comment on this. other people would probably state your reddit tag without a second notice, but not me. because i am not you.",discussion

1. i've dug through the uw acms admissions websites, but none of them seem to have too much information about high school applicants. is it even possible to get into acms dtc as a high schooler? 
2. can i get dtm admission to engineering as a second choice? (ex. if i apply cs as 1st choice major and electrical engineering as 2nd choice, will i be considered for dtm to ee?)
3. my stats aren't the greatest to be completely honest. i have ecs that i'm passionate about, but they're no internships or insane research projects. i've taken the most challenging courses available at my school but my gpa is about a 3.83 which seems like it's on the riskier side for admission to these majors. this might be a dumb question, but do you think that this should influence the major i apply for?
4. i'm also just looking for someone to talk to. if you're currently in the acms program (or know a lot about it), i would be extremely grateful if you could spare \~30 minutes to help me either over text or a through some sort of call. thanks!",admissions

i support palestine, but condemn israel - palestine people are people too, you can't treat them like animals

i support saving all civilians, both israel and palestine, but fuck both hamas and benjamin (israel pm) - both elected governments and head of states are corrupted to its core and both sides of their civilians should elect a new government 

i support neither/rather not say - pretty much you shut your mouth about this or don't have a final opinion yet

long story short, i used to hangout with several classmates (including her) since i transferred here. there are 7 of us, and we were good at first( i thought…) but as some of us got familiar, we found out she complained about basically everyone. once or twice might be our faults, i used to get noticed by my friend 3 times in a row about how my performance at school dissatisfied her. and yes she was saying all these to my friend so i always know.
i was confused and worried at first, but after i knew she complained about her best friend as well, i don’t give a .. i never asked her why as i kinda know it’s a waste of my time 

this quarter we have 2 electives together. as i don’t want to be complained again, i came to the classes myself, decided to not sitting with her (while she’s with her bf :))), but this actually triggered her. i have no clue why this made her so angry, just saw she posted several sentence on threads “accusing” me for impolite etc. i’m not sad at all as i’ll never be what she said, and i won’t even know that’s for me without having my friend’s spoiler screenshoot of their dms. 

i was mad at first, but found it funny when saw her trying to avoid eye contacts with me in classroom. i’m not a sensitive person generally, but i do overthinking, sometimes i couldn’t stop thinking why she’s so weird & why me. does anyone has any suggestions on what i could do to stop overthinking? it’ll be great if you want to share your experience tho

"some people does not have common sense lol okay, midterms and finals are coming up and there are lots of people in the library. i am so frustrated how some people does not know the basic etiquettes regarding using the library. i was studying odegaard library 3rd floor today (noise level of this space is silent btw) and guess what?

1. **people in the study room being absolutely ridiculous and being extremely loud in the study room**: yes, i understand that you booked a study room in 3rd floor so you can talk and have a discussion with your peers. yet, today the people using the study room wasn't even discussing about academic topic at all. they were chit-chatting, complaining about their courses, gossiping about their friends or whatsoever. how do i know what they talked about? because they were so loud i can hear it from the outside of the study room. **is it that hard to notice that the study room isn't noise cancelling at all?** thanks for the juicy stories but it was extremely distracting and it was very loud. if you are using a study room, you can discuss and talk but you probably shouldn't spilling all those extremely hot teas in a very loud voices where everyone can hear you.
2. **someone literally started calling inside the quiet place:** i understand that someone can obviously call you and you can get the call, very quietly respond in a short period of time, and hang up. if you think the call is gonna get longer, you should go outside of the quiet study room, finish the call, and then come back.   
this person i am referring to wasn't even getting the call quietly, nor calling it for short time. he was literally just calling (not even whispering or sth) and responding someone very casually in the quiet space. (not in the 2nd floor or 1st floor) does some people not know that they can open the door and go outside? cus they are free to talk and call outside of the quiet study space. just go outside! it is that simple. 
3. **vaping**: what more can i say? if there are bunch of people studying indoor in a quiet space, it is absolutely a common sense that you shouldn't vape and chit chat with your friends. i saw a fucking smoke and i thought it was a fire or sth. turns out someone was just vaping in the quiet study place. why the hell would you even want to vape in the library smelling all fruity and stuff. go outside cus some people absolutely hate the smell of the vape or vaping in public in general.

reminder: this all happened not in general odegaard library. it happened in the 3rd floor of the library inside the quiet place, where (as the name says) has to be quiet and is made for studying! if you need to chit chat, talk, or vape just go outside of this study room. it is that simple!

i cannot believe i had to address these basic absolutely fucking basic common sense (not even an etiquette). i feel like i am 2nd grade teacher or sth. if you think i am talking about you guys, shame on you and please... please!! don't hinder other people's studying in a literal quiet study space.

"i hate the physics education group i seriously do not care about whatever studies they've done about the reverse classroom model, or their useless learning management softwares, or their labs. the organization of intro physics courses is atrocious, the worst i've ever encountered, it's the same in both 121 and 122, so i'm guessing 123 as well. 

you must do so much reading, because this is the only place the material is, it's impossible to keep up. you have to go the classes for participation credit, which comes from useless learning catalytic quizzes that make you off task by making you pull out your phone every two minutes. the rest of lectures are spent regurgitating bullet points from the text but not actually being taught anything. you could not attend a single lab or lecture section and learn the exact same amount.

it's unfortunate the teaching staff have to work under this system because all they can do is follow the exact rubric the department has shit out even though they are obviously enthusiastic and intelligent. the tests are just measuring how well you can reorganize formulas, not if you understand the material. labs do the same thing in both courses, trying to get you to understand uncertainty and how to make a graph, pretty sure that can be understood in a week, not 22.

the department has obviously paid a lot for how these courses are organized, they pay for pearson, learning analytics, the textbook, creating the vr stuff, building the models. i would guess the sunk cost is too much to get the higher-ups to pull their heads out of their asses and see that they are hurting students by refusing to actually teach them anything.",rant

"is it still super hard to get into the cse major now? (presumably, because the faculty are taking in mostly direct admits) i wanna go to a tech company but i am not a direct admit, what are my options? hi, everyone. i hear this a lot throughout any resource i use to know more about uw: it is hard as hell to transfer to cse in uw from a pre-major(eg. pre-science). 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

if you think this post is long, please just read the paragraph after 'overall'!!!

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

when i first got admitted at uw, i was thinking of getting most pre-requisite courses such as cse, math, and physics from an outside institution which may have a relatively generous grading system(i know these pre-requisites are all weed-out courses, so the grading at uw will be very tough). and next, i will try really hard on the remaining 2-3 pre-requisites(such as if i need to take cse 121, 122, 123, i will take 121,122 at an outside institution where the grading could be easier first so if cse 123 really gets tough, at least my average grade will not be affected too much). 

when i first got admitted at uw, i was thinking of getting most pre-requisite courses such as cse, math, and physics from an outside institution which may have relatively generous grading system(i know these pre-requisites are all weed-out courses, so the grading at uw will be very tough). and next i will try really hard on the remaining 2-3 pre-requisites(such as if i need to take cse 121, 122, 123, i will take 121,122 at an outside institution where the grading could be easier first so if cse 123 really gets tough, at least my average grade will not be affected too much). 

will this work for me to get into the cse major or something related to cs? at least if i try really hard, a gpa of 3.7-3.9 is achievable through this method. to take all the weed-out courses only at uw and maintain a gpa like this would be much harder. so will this method work out?

&#x200b;

\###but here is the thing, if getting into cse major would mean a 4.0 gpa + a very good essay, it is very hard but doable. but is it like now a 4.0 gpa and a well-written essay will still be pretty far from enough to get into the cse major? if that is the thing, there are only two option for me:

first is to get into a major less competitive such as applied math-data science option. but the issue is that i wanna get into a tech company. if the market gets warmer and the hiring freeze starts to cease to a degree, will this land me a job anyway or i have to get a computing degree however the current it market is? can i get a good tech job with a applied math degree from uw(i know this is not the only factor to get a job, but lets just compare them)? will this be very different from a cse degree?

&#x200b;

overall, is it now almost impossible to get into the cse major if not being a direct admit? can i get a good substitution for cse at uw such as what i mentioned, applied math? if none of these will actually work, i may start to double-think about getting my degree here because all i am pursuing right now is to get a cs job after i graduate.

"psa for admitted first years about majors congratulations all incoming huskies! 

every year there is some confusion about majors and applying to uw, and i’m seeing some of that here, so i hope this can clear some things up.

when you applied for uw and selected your intended major, if you are admitted that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re actually in the major. only a select number of majors have the potential for incoming first years to be directly admitted, and those are listed at the attached link. most majors at uw do not allow for direct admit, so if you selected any of those majors on your application as your intended major and were admitted, you were admitted to uw as major undeclared, and may be noted as “pre-major”, “pre-sciences”, “pre-health”, or “pre-art” in your portal, all of these mean you don’t have a major.

psychology for example does not have direct admit, so if you selected psychology and were admitted, you are not actually in the psychology major. you would need to look up psychology’s pre-requisites, complete those courses, and apply once you’re here. some majors are selective and competitive to get into, some only have minimum requirements that as long as you complete those you’re admitted, and some majors are open, meaning there are no pre-reqs and you can declare at any time.

please just be aware during your planning for your first year that there are some steps you may need to take in order to actually get into your major, and plan to take those pre-reqs as soon as possible. uw is different than other schools that will typically admit you into your major when you’re admitted to the school, but uw more often than not will admit only to the school and not directly to any major. 

i hope this clears some things up!

that said, should i say i'm a sophomore on resumes? like it's true technically, but i can't help but feel i'm catfishing because most employers will assume i've got an entire extra year of classes under my belt that i obviously don't have.

"course notes for graduate statistics classes at uw seattle  hi,

these [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-yxzl1eeg5hkyncbkmhj5dllxjyvn8-m8nfaws_qd4e/edit?usp=sharing) are comprehensive and (essentially) to-date with the classes. i wanted to share them here because uw has a great statistics program and others who want to learn might think they are interesting. these are all the classes in the program: [https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/stat.html](https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/stat.html) so you can match material with the course. notes are available in part or entirely (mostly entirely) in about 75% these classes and when they are not the book and relevant sections usually are.

"(cs) gatech vs uoft vs uw (eng) vs ucd vs purdue vs uwm my friend studying cs at ucsd says that the cs ranking for my choices dont really matter and what matters more is overall ranking, location, and everything else; so i guess i want suggestions on that end.

am canadian citizen going to highschool in asia. assuming cost is out of the question, what would you choose?

**gatech cs**

pros

* 18145 undergrad size
* state school p dope
* easier to apply to grad school
* threads curriculum

* name more well known

cons

* atlanta location <<
* sense of community

**university of toronto mississauga cs (still waiting on st george)**

pros

* toronto > atlanta
* geoffery hinton ml group
* ml go crazy
* pretty well known
* community

cons

* 46905 undergrad size 🤯
* will apply to us grad school as international status
* too much academic work - not worth the name - not enough time to pursue extracurricualrs
* post might be kinda hard

**uw (engineering undeclared)**

pros

* washington - microsoft + amazon
* vibes

cons

* got admitted to engineering undeclared, not cs, so will have to transfer into a cs adjacent as transfer to cs is near impossible; but im down to explore  

1. applied and computational mathematical sciences
2. electrical engineering
3. human centered design & engineering
4. informatics

**ucdavis cs**

pros

* california

cons

* ranking
* cs education quality kinda shot

**purdue cs**

pros

"is it worth trying to transfer in to cs, or just transferring to uw tacoma cs? i need to pay for myself financially, but i also want to give myself more opportunities so i was wondering whether i should just continue as a transfer to uws, or just aim to transfer to tacoma instead. 

the gpa recommendation for seattle is a 3.75 minimum with extra-curriculars which is easy enough to be competitive, but i don’t want to be rejected and then have almost nothing transfer over to tacoma so not sure if i should just play it safe with uwt or not.

another conundrum is i was already accepted to uwt, but not uws for cs. i feel like sticking with a community college would still be good to save money, but are there any opportunities for me financially to save money over at tacoma my first two years instead?

"transferring to uw seattle from 4 year (umich)? hey all,

i’m a freshman and international student currently in umich and i do not really like the environment, culture and people here that much and even the cs department here is a little weird. overall i don’t feel happy or academically fulfilled here.

after some research i am super motivated in transferring to uw seattle because of location, better connections and stronger cs program and the transfer acceptance rate is not as low as other prestigious universities. i am also a cs and stats double major.

i currently have a 3.72 gpa. i know my chances at uw cs are altar super low so i don’t how hopeful be because i really want to transfer out of umich and into uw and i am willing to try my absolute best to stand out. should i also apply for stats or math major for higher chances? 

please can you give some words of advice so i can succeed when i apply for transfer during sophomore year? i am motivated and willing to do my absolute best.
