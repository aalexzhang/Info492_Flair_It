1c78tmk,Mold in Hansee ,"Hey,
I live in Hansee and I have since about winter quarter and my skin has not been this bad since I was a freshman in high school. It was fine when I lived in the new dorms, so itâ€™s definitely not a change in habits. While my dorm seems pretty mold free the bathrooms seem to be covered in it, particularly the showers. 

These showers seem like they are never properly washed or maintained, there is a whole in the floor of one of them that has just become one large crevasse of black mold.

Is this just my wing/floor or does anyone else who lives in Hansee experience this? Is this an issue that can be fixed? Anyone else have any moldy Hansee experiences? ",Student Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1c78tmk/mold_in_hansee/,6,20

1c6wmvb,"The Bakery, thoughts?","My freshman year there were so many more houses that hosted shows and I used to really enjoy going to them. But, now it seems like the bakery is really the only one and SO MANY people go. I find it so stressful and can't help but worry something bad might happen.  

Also, I personally feel like the vibes of shows has changed. They use to all be about inclusivity and being yourself and I use to have a lot of fun at them and enjoyed talking to people, but I feel like the last couple times I've gone to the bakery I have felt very unwelcomed and like no one wants to talk to me. One clear thing I have noticed is people dress up way more for the shows, I feel like I can't just wear what I wore to class that day anymore. I have to put on some elaborate trend setting outfit with cool eyeliner just for people to not cut me i the bathroom line. I understand self expression, but its gotten to a point where it feels like I have to perform and present a certain way just to attend. Honestly it feels like I'm back in high school except in high school I was too queer for the cool kids and now I feel like I don't present queer enough, but now all the cool kids are bi in a het relationship and don't like the word lesbian because it ""sounds too harsh"".

I haven't attended one in a while though, is this still the vibe? Does it still get PACKED? and idk maybe because it 420 and there's no theme it might not be as intense.  My friends and I are thinking or going, but also seriously not because this is an experience we've all felt. have people had good experiences there as of lately? What type of people have been attending? Part of me also thinks maybe its because I am not a freshman anymore, I know non freshman go, but I also know ALOT of freshman do attend and maybe only want to talk to other freshman. Who knows, and maybe what I am saying is a hot take. ",Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1c6wmvb/the_bakery_thoughts/,11,25
