n0rlj3,[Opinionated Overview] The whole beef between the ASUW and The Daily is so incredibly messed up and it makes me so angry.,"**UPDATE:** I have posted a follow-up thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1e3kz/a_followup_on_my_opinionated_overview_and_how_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that includes detailed instructions on submitting complaints and a petition to resolve problems surrounding the sending of the email.

[The cartoon in question](https://preview.redd.it/yvd4q5t2ozv61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90dfd1f3c40f2ead992a6a457b65913ace3b830)

So I, like many of you received an email from ASUW (from which I am not subscribed to any newsletter) about racist imagery targeting certain UW students. My first thought was that it was probably some right-wing cartoonist who posted a problematic opinion piece that crossed the line, but I couldn't find it because it seemed to have already been removed. You can see it above here. The general consensus amongst students who have problems with this is essentially that this cartoon compares the majority BIPOC candidates to animals (along with a food truck and public art piece).

Before I move on and explain why I don't think this is a comparison or racist at all, let me give you the context for the cartoon that the mass-sent email left out. The Daily is a student-run newspaper that always posts their candidate endorsements for the ASUW elections, which is UW's student government. This year however, likely due to Covid-19 and people not being as involved and on-campus, the tickets for the major races stand completely uncontested with one unofficial opposition ticket. The Daily this year decided to not endorse any of the candidates, specifically stating that ""This year, The Daily has decided not to endorse any of the candidates,  all of whom are qualified for their respective positions but, based on  their performance, are clearly not prepared."" I *highly* encourage you to read the full endorsement article, which can found [here](https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html). You will find that while the writers have both positive and negative opinions on each candidate, they still choose not to endorse any.

Now here is where the cartoon comes in: since all of the elections are uncontested, the article pokes fun at this fact by suggesting write-in candidates consisting of iconic UW imagery. Any student who has been on campus and many who have not had the chance will be able to recognize these ""candidates"" as staples of the UW's campus culture and jokes pertaining to them have been common for as long as they have existed. Now, the medicinal herb garden monkey seems to be the animal people are most upset about, and it does not help that it is one of the more niche UW icons. If you are unaware of the monkey, you can read about it's history and see pictures of it [here](https://magazine.washington.edu/monkey-business-the-story-of-the-uw-medicinal-herb-garden-and-its-guardians). Considering all of this information and context, I am hard-pressing in seeing the angle that many critics are presenting that the candidates are being ""compared"" in any way to these animals which only make up a portion of the suggestions.

Ultimately, The Daily removed this cartoon from their publication and issued an open-letter apology to the ASUW. If this is where the controversy ended, I would move on and not make this post but I am sure most of you reading this are aware of the email that was just sent to all UW students from the ASUW.

Today, the ASUW president issued an email to all UW students under the subject ""ASUW Response to the 04/26 Post from The Daily"" which claimed, without any context provided, that The Daily had published ""racist imagery from The Daily surrounding the current ASUW elections"". I, like many of you, went to the subreddit and my friends in both The Daily staff and the ASUW to see what had happened and after which found a cartoon that was blown significantly out of proportion by the ASUW.

I am extremely disappointed that the ASUW leadership would abuse their power to email every UW student, regardless of subscription status, to paint The Daily as racist out of nowhere to the entire student body over a few student's perception of one cartoon from one artist. The Daily is a student-run organization that staffs many POC's and has always supported progressive student movements, protests, and actions. It is completely unfair for them to have someone with the power to email every student claim that they published racist imagery after the cartoon was removed and people can't even see the what was posted anymore. How is The Daily even supposed to defend themselves if the narrative can be so easily controlled by one side? The calls for The Daily to ""do better"" than the apology by donating from their already limited budget to things like mutual aid is outrageous and completely unnecessary. I saw one student say that ""y'all gotta pay reparations anyway"" so the POC staff for The Daily better open up their wallets, I guess.

There needs to be consequences for whoever approved this abusive and manipulative email to be sent to the entire student body like this. All it has done is put the safety of The Daily staff in jeopardy and given fuel for right-wing pundits to use to indoctrinate even more people who have an irrational fear of cancel culture. However, I for one do not want to wait for action to be taken and call for people to write in ""Dubs I"" for every position to show that we are not okay with this kind of behavior from those who are supposed to protect and lift up our student organizations who fight for just causes, especially the press which highlights many civil rights and social justice issues facing the students in our school.

&#x200B;

TLDR: The ASUW president sent an email to every UW student out of nowhere and with no context claiming that The Daily is racist over a cartoon that was no longer publicly available, unfairly controlling the narrative of the situation and putting the safety of the publicly listed staff of The Daily in jeopardy.

ffajy9,DO NOT come to UW if you want to do CS but are not DA,"**PSA: If you are dead set on studying Computer Science at UW and not directly admitted to the major, DO NOT COME HERE.**

Since it’s UW admission season, and many soon-to-be college freshmen are looking to study Computer Science (CS), I’d like to give some of my thoughts about why anybody who isn’t a direct admit (DA) and is looking to study CS should steer clear of coming to UW.

First of all, if you were admitted to UW Computer Science as a Direct Admit freshman, congratulations! I highly highly highly recommend coming here to study because UW CS is pretty much cream of the crop, and you’ll have a great time here.

This post is meant for everyone who applied to CS and was admitted to UW as a pre-sciences student, or applied to Computer Engineering and was admitted as a Direct to College (DTC) of Engineering student.

As a 3x CSE reject, I will try to explain this to the best of my ability. If there’s anything that can be improved, let me know in the comments and I’ll edit it.

In an effort to accommodate the large demand for CS and to avoid having students go to UW for a few years only to not get into CS, the Paul Allen school moved to a mainly DA system in 2019. This means that almost all people studying computer science at UW will be DA freshmen from now on. So if the Computer Science program admissions were competitive before for current UW students, it’s hell now. [Even the UW website tells you to go to a different school.](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm)

Here’s some attitudes I had as a CS-hopeful freshman that got BTFO’d after being in UW for a year and a half (I’m a sophomore now).

**“Oh, I’ll work hard and I’ll get in for sure!”**

And so will everyone else. I’m sure you’ve all been getting 3.9 GPA/36 ACT/1600 SAT, and a ton of 5s on AP tests with no problem in high school, and expect to keep getting top scores in college. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN IN COLLEGE! You are now in a school where everyone else is as smart as you. Your study habits that got you an A in high school will land you a 2.6 in Physics 121. Even if you do somehow land a 4.0 GPA, it STILL might not be enough to get into CS. Searching this subreddit will show you some people with ridiculously good grades and extracurriculars who still got rejected from CS.

Your whole grade is determined by 2 or 3 exams, because homework counts for shit. If you want to get into CS, you need to get a near perfect score on every single exam. The margin for error is about one or two problems on every test, meaning if you fuck up big time on one problem on one exam, especially in CSE 143, it’s over. I fucked up on a recursion problem and a stacks and queues problem on my CSE 143 midterm and it was enough to bury my CSE admission chances into the ground.

Your grades are also highly dependent on luck. Just take this quarter, for example. One of my friends got below average on the CSE 143 midterm and wanted to use the final to pull up his grade. It just so happens that the entire school has now shut down due to coronavirus and the CSE 143 final is cancelled, so he’s fucked. Professors and TAs also grade differently and have different teaching materials. This is a lot of variability when every single point on every single assignment and test matters when you’re trying to get into CS.

**For DTC admits:**

This section is for all of you freshmen who applied for Computer Engineering (or any other engineering major) and got ""Engineering Undeclared"" status. If you got Pre-Engineering, you are not in the College of Engineering and this section doesn't apply to you.

Now, you College of Engineering admits might think, “oh, I got DTC, I’m set lol” THIS IS NOT THE CASE. If getting into CS through the regular pathway is at a 10/10 difficulty, getting into CE through DTC is like 9/10 difficulty. It’s possible if you get near perfect scores on everything and have an outstanding application, but I’ve known multiple people who’ve had a 3.8 GPA with a 3.5+ CSE 143 grade get rejected from Computer Engineering [One look at these DTC admission statistics](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement/data) should tell you that literally everyone else also thought they could get into Computer Engineering through DTC and that it’s by far the most competitive engineering major. This year, I’ve talked to countless people who applied to just Computer Engineering in the first application cycle and ended up in Electrical Engineering this second application cycle. [Even the College of Engineering website says that DTC isn’t a good fit for Computer Engineering or bust people.](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/directtocollege/faq) When you apply for a major through DTC (called “[placement](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement)”), you pick 6 majors (you can pick less, but then you’re not guaranteed a major) by the order in which you want to study them and then the admissions officers pretty much pick your major for you out of that list. You’re guaranteed at least your last pick. If you don’t accept what they give you, they will KICK YOU OUT of the College of Engineering. They’ll try to tell you in your E-FIG that eNgInEeRiNg iS InTeRdIsCiPlInArY, but the similarities between Computer Engineering and Environmental Engineering are laughable. If you get into DTC and you’re going for Computer Engineering, get ready to select Electrical Engineering as your backup major.

**“Oh, I can get into a backup major that is pretty much just like CS!”**

[Here’s an overview of some CS-related majors.](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/overview/related-majors)

I’ll go over four CSE backup majors here.

**Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences (ACMS):**

If CS is a 10/10 difficulty to get admitted to normally, then ACMS is like a 9/10. It’s also super fucking difficult, because you will have to study a ton of math that CS majors won’t have to. This is a really good option if you’re into data science, machine learning, and other applications of mathematical computing but it’s a small department and almost as hard as CS to get into.

**Electrical Engineering (EE):**

EE is not very hard to get into if you’re DTC (like a 3.0 GPA will be good enough if your application is strong), but ironically it’s probably a harder major to study because of all the extra math and physics. EE is not the best major to study if you’re only interested in becoming a software engineer. Most EE concentrations don’t have much in common with CS curriculum, and you’ll be spending most of your time building circuits and studying continuous math rather than looking at discrete mathematics and data structures. The Embedded Systems track is probably the closest you can get to studying Computer Engineering as an EE student; however, I’ve heard that it’s a niche field within CSE.

**Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE):**

HCDE pretty much only accepts DTC students now. [They had a 13% admit rate this last cycle.](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/bs/admissions-faq)

HCDE is a great major, but it focuses almost solely on user design. It is a program for people looking to become UX/UI designers, not for computer scientists. Some front-end development skills are covered, but don’t expect any algorithms or computing theory or anything that will really prepare you for a full stack development or software engineering job from this major.

**Informatics:**

IMO, Informatics is the best backup for aspiring software developers. You won’t learn much theory but you’ll learn a lot of full stack development skills, design skills, cybersecurity skills, and more, depending on what track you decide to study. Admissions are actually holistic and don't focus on grades heavily, so even if you get a 3.0 in CSE 143 you’ll still have a good chance. However, every single CSE reject is also applying for Informatics and it is insanely competitive. I took Info 200 this quarter and my professor repeatedly stated that they turn down many qualified applicants each cycle just because there is not enough space to accommodate everyone.

**Other Backup Major Advice:**

There are some other majors like Geographic Information Systems but at that point you should think about if you really want to study Geography or if it’s best to just cut your losses and transfer to UW Bothell.

If you’re thinking about just loading up on CSE non-major classes, while being in another major, it might be better just to go to another school. The non-major courses vary in quality since they are not the courses CSE focuses its time and effort on (that’s reserved for the major courses). CSE 373 is good, but I’ve heard the rest of the non-major CSE classes can be very variable in quality.

If you plan to pursue a backup major, make sure you’re actually interested in the backup major. After all, you’ll be spending most of your time studying that major and not CSE courses.

**In conclusion**, it is not worth the time and effort to pour 2 years of your life into polishing every single line of code to perfection and fretting about every single lost point on every assignment/test at the cost of all other parts of your life just to be handed rejection after rejection from the CSE department. Don’t make the mistake I made. I was accepted to CS programs in multiple schools around the country, but I turned them all down to go to UW since it was my top choice. I have spent countless hours regretting going to UW and agonizing over what majors I could still apply for after CSE was no longer a realistic option. Thankfully, I was admitted to a major (see flair) I am interested in studying, but I know many people who are in a much worse place than I am. I hope this post gave a little insight for those of you who have been admitted to UW and are still deciding on what school to commit to.

**TL;DR: if you are dead set on studying CS, do not come to UW Seattle if you were not directly admitted to the major. It is virtually impossible to get admitted to CS and you would be much better off going to another school to study CS.**

186ikde,Guy grabbing women's butts at U District station,"So yesterday afternoon I (23F) was waiting for the light rail and someone came up behind me and grabbed my ass. It was a light touch and so stealthy that I wasn't even 100% sure he had done it intentionally, until I asked a girl next to me if he grabbed my ass and she said yes.

About 5 minutes ago, I was able to get in contact with someone higher up with a better understanding of the fish tank policy and was informed that I CAN keep my shrimp! And, there will be no one coming in to make sure they are removed. So we have won that battle.

Still very exhausted from an emotional day of trying to figure out what to with my shrimp babies. 

The next task for me is to prevent this agony from happening to another shrimp parent—HFS needs to be more clear on the rules regarding what can go in a fish tank. 

So! Thank you to everyone who signed the petition! I’m hoping it will bring attention to this giant oversight in policy.

tbo3hn,2:30am harassed w/ taser by red square,"open note to the two assholes who buzzed a taser at me approx. 2:30 this morning: fuck you.

hopefully the intended audience sees this but if not, some context: i was walking myself from campus back to my room really late. walking up from drumheller, i saw a couple in front of me (other students, probably freshman or sophomores), walking in the same direction towards my dorm. i was at an awkward distance behind them, not super close, but close enough to consider speeding up to pass. the girl kept looking back at me weirdly and i thought she might be uncomfortable so i decided to pass them w/ a good amount of room between us. understandable, it was late at night, i didn’t want to make her paranoid walking behind them and i also was irritated at her looking back at me so much like holy shit seriously learn how to mind your business.

after i pass and am continuing to walk faster to create space, they start saying shit about having a taser, i guess as a warning? they said that they would use it on me if i came at them or something and started laughing like it was some sort of joke. then scared the shit out of me by buzzing it, which apparently they thought was funny too because they were joking around. i didn’t acknowledge them even as they continued to laugh at my expense, lowkey scared they would be stupid enough to actually attack me with the taser if i engaged.

keep in mind that nothing about me screams threatening: i’m a 19 year old girl, 5’1” and i was wearing sweatpants, a lanyard, no dark clothes and had my backpack on - literally peak tired college student attire. i understand being apprehensive at night but they turned a non-situation into borderline harassment.

anyways, fuck both of you. i was minding my own business and that was incredibly humiliating and scary. like middle school bully level shit. hope that you both fail your finals and have a terrible spring break fr. manifesting it 🙏🙏",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/tbo3hn/230am_harassed_w_taser_by_red_square/,32,508

v47zub,"So, HBO is Limiting Disability and General Access to Your Building","Hi everyone! I know we've all been very annoyed with how UW Photography (as a division of UW Marketing and Communications) and HBO have been affecting movement on campus this week. Including intervals as long as 10-15 minutes yesterday where the director refused to let students through sets including over wheelchair accessible ramps and doors WHILE yelling at students to take off their masks.

I am here to share some resources, emails, and advice to direct your anger over anything from being late for your finals to film crews parked in fire lanes and blocking access to wheelchair accessible entrances and pathways on campus.

First:
RECORD EVERYTHING. if you genuinely want to hold UW and HBO accountable for their glaring ADA errors here, take pictures and videos to document exactly what they're doing.

BE CONFRONTATIONAL but non-violent, they have no legal authority to prevent you from traveling anywhere on the campus of a university to which you pay tuition.

Now upload it.

Next:
EMAIL. Flood the inboxes or the following people for whatever they caused or can resolve.

Studio Manager (for UW Photography) Pamela Dore
pdore@uw.edu
According to multiple representatives from UW Marketing & Communications / UW Photography, Dore is the person responsible from providing access to and greenlighting activities of the production on campus.

HBO On-Set ADA Representative, Mark Freid
markafreid@gmail.com
This guy is supposed to work to ensure HBO remains ADA compliant.

Director / Campus Filming & University Photography, Alanya Cannon
alcan@uw.edu
Alanya is responsible on behalf of the university to ensure ADA and other issues do not impact students in and around the production.

filmoffice@seattle.gov
All film productions of this scale go through the Seattle Office of Film and Music to get permits, etc.
The DO NOT enable them to block accessible pathways or park in fire lanes.

These people all have phone numbers, too, so please use what you are comfortable with.

Finally:
Share this post. The more people who come here and find resources to share the issues they've encountered with the production, the louder we are, the quicker they fix it.

Here's my understanding of the situation because people deserve more clarity than what admin is saying.

Before I begin, use these guides:

[Spring Quarter Overview](https://www.washington.edu/provost/springquarter/)

[Housing and Food Services](https://www.washington.edu/provost/springquarter/)

[Registration (Classes)](https://registrar.washington.edu/2020/03/26/spring-quarter-2020-covid-19-faqs/)

[Financial Aid](https://www.washington.edu/financialaid/2020/03/20/covid-19-faqs/)

They're going to answer \*almost\* any question you have and they are the starting point for my inferences.

I am a Senior on the Services and Activities Fee, we set the SAF, IMA, and FRF every year, not tuition or other fees but I can shed light on the process. This is grossly oversimplified.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit for added clarity, 3/29/2020 6pm**

Many of the tuition and fee items are determined at the state level a year ahead. The UW itself does not operate independently. As a state school, budgets for various sections of the university are presented to the Board of Regents, and some must be approved by the state legislature. Making any tuition change cannot happen just with the President, without legislative, or at least, board approval.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best way I can think to do this is go one by one on each item in your tuition bill.

# Operations Fee (Tuition)

**What it is:** This is what people think about when we say tuition. It gets divided up among the different colleges and departments based on enrollment. The money funds mostly faculty and some staff as well as educational costs. For In-State students, the State of WA picks up about 2/3 of this tab but out of state students and international students pay full price. This money also pays for all University operations like Ana Marie's salary and UW IT (who are very busy these days).  The UW gets a lot of money from donors, our endowment, and from athletics... BUT NONE OF IT PAYS FOR SCHOOL. All of that money pays for extra stuff like new buildings and scholarships.

**Why it won't go down:** All the money tuition goes towards still has to be paid out. (ex: faculty are on salaries). The only way it will go down is if someone else picks up the tab. The State of Washington could as could the Federal Government but that's about it.

# Building Fee (Tuition)

**What it is:** This pays for what the state and donors don't, but it keeps the lights on. Literally. It funds custodial staff and regular building maintenance, plus some other stuff.

**Why it won't go down:** The buildings may be used less but the custodians are working harder than ever. The labs can't shut off, nor can the servers, security systems, custodial offices and grounds keepers. There will be very little electricity savings in comparison so we'll get nothing back.

# [(Student) Technology Fee](https://uwstf.org/)  (STF)

**What it is:** This is a mandatory fee that Seattle Campus students voted to give ourselves and it funds all sorts of cool stuff like DawgPrints, Charging Stations, and even new cardio equipment at the IMA. It is administered by a committee of students who allocate funding and increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** The money has already been sent out to projects and programs that are helping students even though we're not there. Most notably the [Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/) [which gives out FREE laptops to students this quarter so they can still attend class remotely.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgPeMw-hL7w&t=0s)

# [Services and Activities Fee](https://depts.washington.edu/safcom/about.php) (SAF)

**What it is:** This is very similar to STF but it funds the operations of 17 different, student-facing units on the Seattle Campus. These include essential services like [Hall Health](http://depts.washington.edu/hhpccweb/clinics-services/primary-care/), [The Counseling Center](https://www.washington.edu/counseling/), and [The Food Pantry](https://www.washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry/). It also includes things that are closed like [the IMA](https://www.washington.edu/ima/) and the [HUB](https://hub.washington.edu/). Some units will save a little money on student wages this quarter but they will still pay lots to their professional staff. The money also funds [ASUW](http://www.asuw.org/), [GPSS](http://depts.washington.edu/gpss/) and [The Daily](http://www.dailyuw.com/) which are still very active and especially important right now. It is administered by a committee of students who allocate funding and increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** Because the funding is allocated annually and although some units will save money, others won't. The savings will just go towards next year's programs and or special online programming this quarter. Even if we could reduce it for one quarter (which would be hard because it's an annual allocation), we are bound by state law to keep fee increases under 4% annually so any decrease now screws over all future students because the units would be dramatically underfunded for a few years.

# IMA Bond Fee

**What it is:** This fee is used to pay off a 30-year loan issued to the Students by the UW Internal Loan Program (UW internal bank) which funded the IMA building renovation in 2004. Right now, the SAF Committee is planning on using this fee to fund another [30 year loan to remodel the IMA pool and locker room](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/7gigks/uw_recreation_wants_to_hear_from_you_about_a/). It is administered by the SAF Committee who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** This fee pays off a loan and unless the loan payments are deferred for the quarter, the money must still be collected. The UW board of Regents may be able to authorize a temporary hold on payments to eliminate the fee for this quarter, but I doubt that will happen.

# Facilities and Renovation Fee (FRF)

**What it is:** This fee is used to pay off a 30-year loan issued to the Students by the UW Internal Loan Program (UW internal bank) which funded the Hall Health, HUB, and ECC building renovations in 2012.  It is administered by the SAF Committee who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** This fee pays off a loan and unless the loan payments are deferred for the quarter, the money must still be collected. The UW board of Regents may be able to authorize a temporary hold on payments to eliminate the fee for this quarter, but I doubt that will happen.

# [U-PASS Fee](https://transportation.uw.edu/getting-here/transit/student-advisory-board)

**EDIT 4/6:** [U-PASS has been waived for the whole quarter. You will get a refund for if you already paid it. If transit services start charging again before the end of the quarter, students will be able to purchase U-PASS at the employee rate.](https://transportation.uw.edu/news/u-pass-update-spring-quarter)

**What it is:** This fee, which was voted on by students to give to ourselves, goes directly to local transit agencies so that UW students have almost unlimited access to transit in the region. The funds are allocated to each agency based on how many students used that service. (which is why you still have to tap your husky card instead of just showing the driver your card). Most students don't use all $88 of value they paid for per quarter, but almost every commuter student uses way more than that. In general we subsidize transit for those who need it most. It is administered by the U-PASS Advisory Board (made up of students) who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** IT MIGHT!!! Most transit agencies that U-PASS is apart of have suspended fares during the shutdown because ridership is very low and they don't want anyone going near the drivers. (You enter from the back door of buses). Because of this, even if a UW student were to travel by transit, they won't have to tap their card, and thus, the transit agency wouldn't get any money from the U-PASS pot. This means that we probably don't need to pay the fee for this quarter.

**EDIT 3/29 from** **A student who knows a lot about the U-PASS program budget**

>In addition to student fees, which make up most of the program, the U-PASS is paid for in part by money from the central budget office & money that is overflow from parking revenue.  
>  
>The money from the central budget office is equal to 10% of the program costs with the caveat that it is capped at 1.8 million dollars.

>The parking money, called Transit Demand Management, is supposed to make the U-PASS program whole. However, just like the money from the central budgeting office, it has a cap. (I believe the cap might still be in some negotiation, but right now, as far as I know, it is as follows: a maximum of 62% of TDM may be paid to the U-PASS program of total TDM parking revenue).  
>  
>Basically, with campus shut down, the U-PASS fee might be able to be put on pause, but it probably won’t generate any surplus or something if the fee doesn’t end up getting waived. And the random and arbitrary caps to the aid the program receives from the university will be reached  sometime in the next two years (according to estimates) so there will be some fee increases for students.  
>  
>The U-PASS program provides like $500 value for $80 per quarter and even with substantial increases to the fee it would be “worth it” to many students who commute. Plus, the last time the fee was raised was 2016 so it’s been a little while.

Lab Fees/Class Fees

I don't know much about Class Fees but it is really dumb that these won't be eliminated, especially if the money was for supplies you won't use. Some classes have lab fees for computer related things and that will, of course, still apply. So far it seems bad but do the following and we might be okay.

**What can you do about all this?**

[Drop out for one quarter. (this is not free)](https://registrar.washington.edu/2020/03/26/spring-quarter-2020-covid-19-faqs)

Contact the UW with any specific issues you have with your situation. [Emergency aid is available and can cover fees.](https://www.washington.edu/emergencyaid/)

Contact ASUW to unify as a student body for State and Federal Support.  [This is actually where the petition comes in handy because it shows high volumes of student support.](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-washington-seattle-partial-tuition-refund-for-spring-2020-at-uw?cs_tk=AnQRv_-s-jPXPv3Ng14AAXicyyvNyQEABF8BvGuLAuh6p1_zwOEWpNyxKWQ=&utm_campaign=36c897f15b8a4f649da65dd56d175e86&utm_content=initial_v0_0_1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=recruit_sign_digest&utm_term=cs&fbclid=IwAR3eibloZJeoOI_xjPFKxiOajb-bGT2LfgxRGpxaST3tcHZnx1Lz53IVDOM)

# [UW Housing](https://hfs.uw.edu/Coronavirus-FAQ-for-Residents)

HFS is offering to not charge any student who won't be on campus for spring quarter housing with no fees for cancellation. The deadline for this request has passed but you can still contact them. Those students have to move out by May 3rd to not get charged. They will also not be charged for a dining plan. This is particularly impressive considering how much of your housing amount goes to paying off the 30-year loans they used to build all the new dorms. I'm sure they have it figured out, but this is actually a big deal.

# [UW Food](https://hfs.uw.edu/Coronavirus-FAQ-for-Residents#UnspentDining)

This is an issue because lots of people have leftover money on their dining plans that they were planning on using during spring quarter, myself included. They will give a partial refund but not a full one mostly because HFS does not take ANY MONEY AT ALL from the state or from tuition. They need dining revenues to cover costs like the chefs and custodians at their dining facilities. They will basically give back all the money they saved by not having to feed 10,000 people for the last two weeks of winter quarter but that won't be the full amount because there were still lots of costs. HFS donates almost all its leftover food to the Food Pantry too, so don't worry about anything being wasted.

# Off Campus Housing

The state has so far not issued a freeze on rents but they have issued a freeze on evictions so if you can't pay and can't get your stuff right away, you will have time to come back. Most landlords should be understanding. [Here is some helpful info on your rights as a tenant.](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/husky-neighborhood-project/landlord-tenant/) Lots of people have begun the process of finding a subletter for their space now instead of waiting until the end of the quarter. The Facebook groups offering these are pretty saturated and there isn't a whole lot of demand but it's worth a shot.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/fqylrn/why_we_still_have_to_pay_full_price_for_tuition/,37,444

n9rg51,Just some advice from my therapist: You May *THINK* you’re doing well under pandemic circumstances but your body subconsciously understands that you need to survive right now and that’s going to manifest in a way that works for you and you might not know it. So take inventory of yourself…,"Prevent yourself from reaching burn out or that pending mental break down. 

Take a second to breathe. Mentally ground yourself. 


My Mom was subconsciously suppressing her emotions caused by the pandemic for an entire year which landed her in the hospital for the worst panic attack that manifested as psycho motor retardation and we didn’t know what actually was wrong with her until her third visit where her panic attack manifested as a pseudo-seizure.

My point is, if you can’t keep going next quarter, don’t. The pandemic threw out whatever self or societal imposed timeline you have to follow. Do what makes you happy. Do what makes you feel healthy. Take care of yourself.

Don’t fucking grind your life away for an institution that’ll say your name once and then never again after you yeet yourself off the aurora bridge. 

You are your #1 fan. Live your fucking life man.

Sincerely,

I have been a part of this restaurant business since when I was born, since I attended UW, since I graduated, and since I moved on to my own full-time job. I enjoyed my time occasionally working there at the register, wrapping musubis, chugging the chilled hawaiian suns, and bringing my nintendo switch to play with my UW friends. I have also worked on the menu, website, point-of-sale system, and many other things behind the scenes. While I have not lived as long as the restaurant's existence, the memories felt eternal as Hawaii BBQ has deeply influenced my life, and our family's life. One of the earliest fondest memories I had was when the restaurant still over at the old location (50th ave), my sis and I would sleep and play at the restaurant all day. Now that my parents are retiring, both happy and sad for our family, this restaurant will finally see its end. It is time for me to start taking care of my parents. Thank you all for your patronage and thank you for making my time there enjoyable.

ps: i know this post is very sudden but i would encourage you all to visit in person before it permanently shuts down. also the online ordering systems sucks (fees and all), you can always call to order ahead. we'd prefer if you try our dishes fresh :)

hrpy2h,Thanks for standing up for your fellow international students.,"We finally did it. I just wanted to thank each and everyone of you who signed the petition, advocated it and showing your support through it all. Some of you even volunteered to drop your own classes, the college has immediately shown their support. Everybody pulled their weight, and I am so incredibly touched. 

During this whole 2020 saga, the international community has also been actively helping to amplify voices of the oppressed. I love how when it’s our turn, people stood up for us. 

Most of us are afraid to speak up but I’m privileged to live in a place where freedom of speech is a human right.

oq8s6q,Advice for students moving to campus for the first time that I wish I was given when I was a freshman.,"HFS gives stupid advice and product recommendations. Your RAs are knowledgeable, but they're not the ones in control of the handbooks or websites. This is a collection of random tips I've accumulated in my time living at UW, and from friends of mine at UW and other colleges.  

&#x200B;

DORM SUPPLIES:

&#x200B;

***DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OCM. I ASSUME HFS GETS A CUT OF SALES, BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS ARE GARBAGE.***

&#x200B;

For bedding, look on amazon, there are tons of Twin XL (the size UW beds are) options there for far cheaper and with a better return policy than OCM (The company HFS shills for). Buy a pillow online, at Target, or bring one from home. I promise you they will be higher quality than OCM.

&#x200B;

For towels, go to Target or, if you can, Costco. The towels at Costco are dirt cheap and VERY high quality. Buy two bath towels and a dish towel. You can buy a bath mat, but I would just dry off in the shower and save the $8. 

&#x200B;

**For any kind of kitchenware, GO TO TARGET.** I was able to buy one bowl, one plate, one dish, one fork, one knife, and one spoon for cheap. I recommend bringing some kind of thermos or travel mug to fill up on the free coffee in the dining halls in the morning to avoid buying the exact same coffee at Starbucks for $5. 

&#x200B;

Miscellaneous tips:

\-***DON'T BUY THE EXPENSIVE DINING PLAN.*** I was duped into thinking it was the best option before I set foot on campus (you've probably read the HFS guide saying that anything less than the level 4 will leave you without food half the time, that's complete bunk.) The food on campus is OK at best and very cheap. A meal costs around $8 at most, more with sides, so the $1100 or whatever the level 1 is plan will cover quite a lot. 

&#x200B;

\-Additionally, you're in Seattle. You're a 10 minute walk or a 20 minute bus ride from some of the best food in the world. Don't waste all your college meals on a greasy sub-mcdonalds quality burger. 

&#x200B;

\-Your dining account can be used at the District Market (on-campus grocery store). I wouldn't use actual money here, as its almost all 10-40% more expensive than any other grocery store, but it's a good way to burn the money you won't want to use on junky fast food. 

&#x200B;

\-**Amazon is your friend.** You will forget things. You will break things. You'll be living in Seattle so 90% of packages will be able to be delivered next day, or if you're really lucky, later the same day. If you don't have prime but your parents do, have them set up Amazon Household, which will give you access to free prime shipping.

&#x200B;

\-**Bring batteries and lightbulbs.** These are both weirdly expensive around the University, so buy them and bring them.

&#x200B;

\-**Lighting is a must.** The dorms can get really dark and depressing, especially in overcast Seattle winter, which is all of Seattle winter. I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to spend $50 on a ""mood lamp"", but some fairy lights, desk lamps, floor lamps, or, if you're so inclined and your roommate doesn't object (ASK FIRST) TikTok style LEDs.

&#x200B;

\-On the same line as Lighting, **bring a plant**. Studies have repeatedly shown increased mood, energy, and focus in people who have leafy plants in their environments as compared to those who do not. Pothos, Lucky Bamboo, and Fiddleleaf Fig are all pretty cheap and easy to care for. Spend 10 minutes researching them so you don't kill them instantly and you'll be golden.

&#x200B;

\-Laundry. Doesn't have to be Tide, but **any laundry pod is a lifesaver for dorm laundry.** You don't want to haul a 2 gallon jug of detergent up 5 flights of stairs (unless you're trying to get a leg workout in, in which case go for it). I have a collapsible hamper so I would often bring my laundry down with a pod or two, start it going,  put the hamper in my backpack, then go get lunch on the AVE.

&#x200B;

\-**If you need a mini fridge, see if you can buy used.** I paid $50 on Facebook Marketplace for one that retails for $200. It's a little late now, but graduates often get rid of theirs at the end of the year. Facebook Marketplace is a great place to start looking. 

&#x200B;

\-**Get a Coffee Maker / Electric Kettle.** Either of these will pay for themselves in a month if you drink a lot of Tea, Coffee, or Cocoa (also good for ramen).

&#x200B;

If you're not sure if you'll need something or not, err on the side of conservativism. Dorms are small. You don't want to be like I was and have a bunch of storage bins full of junk I never used, or even wanted to use. Save your money on the front end, don't buy a rice cooker and a, instant pot and an air fryer and a frying pan and 50 other things ""just in case"". If you realize you need something, buy it on Amazon, or go to the store. If Seattle seems expensive, hop on a bus (if I recall correctly the 522 or the 255 will work) and go to Bellevue, Kirkland, or Redmond. On top of seeing more of the area if you're not from here, these towns can be much cheaper (also typically safer for walking alone but that's another issue for another post) than anywhere in Seattle, and unlimited bus fare is included in Tuition. 

&#x200B;

**Off topic but maybe helpful bits of wisdom**

&#x200B;

**-**I always keep a few $1 bills in a pocket with nothing else in it when I'm walking around. This way, if one of the many many beggars around the AVE or Seattle in general comes up and asks, or worse, demands money, I can hand them a small amount without pulling out my whole wallet or risking dropping stuff. You will be asked for money. Sometimes, you will be asked for money in a very forceful way. One wants to assume these are people down on their luck with the best intentions, but the reality is some are dangerous. **NEVER PULL OUT YOUR WALLET WHEN GIVING AN UNHOUSED PERSON OR BEGGAR MONEY.** Many are good people on bad times, some are not. 

&#x200B;

\-This applies to anyone, but especially those who are women or minorities of any kind, and those who are less physically intimidating. **Avoid walking alone** off or near campus. The campus proper is fairly safe, but you go one street in any direction and all bets are off. Do not walk alone, do not walk with headphones on, and do not walk at night. Ensure bags are secure and closed. Probably, you'll never have a problem. Expect the best and plan for the worst. 

&#x200B;

\-**Don't study in your dorm**. I could wax poetic about sleep hygiene all day but it boils down to this: Don't use spaces for all purposes. Sleep in your sleeping space, relax in your relaxation space, study in your study space. There are libraries for studying. They're very nice. Use them. You will be more productive, I promise.

&#x200B;

\-**Find your people.** Don't rely on highschool friends alone for socialization in college. Join a club you're genuinely passionate about, not that you think would look cool to be in. Personally, I've made all my friends at UW through Dungeons and Dragons. Anything that forces groups of 3-6 people together to interact on any personal level will absolutely build relationships. I might make a whole other post about this later. 

&#x200B;

I didn't set out with the intent to write this long of a post (In fact this was originally going to be a 1 paragraph psa about the dining level) but these are genuinely all things that if I had known going into college my first year I would have been much better off. Hopefully this will help at least one person with at least one thing and if it does, it was worth it. If you have any other tips (the real LPT is always in the comments) I'll add them to the list with credit. Feel free to repost or plagiarize any of this, if it would help more people know what they're doing.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/oq8s6q/advice_for_students_moving_to_campus_for_the/,67,383

u/frick_salamanders should be able to keep their aquarium shrimp. HFS has asked them to rehome them, stating aquatic shrimp are not fish and are not allowed in their fish tank.

no0q4b,Safety on the Ave,"I am usually more of a lurker than a poster but I wanted to draw attention to the fact that a lot of women do not feel safe walking near campus. 

I can only share my own experiences but typically when I have experienced catcalling and unwanted attention near campus (the Ave in particular) it’s usually men who are obviously older and more than likely don’t go to UW. Just a few minutes ago, however, I had an interaction with a guy who was definitely of student age so I wanted to address it here. 

Some context. I enjoy walking alone, it provides me some clarity in my typically hectic life. I know that can leave me “more vulnerable” but I take necessary safety precautions (even though I shouldn’t have to). I’m walking down the Ave with my earbuds in and suddenly a guy crosses the street diagonally — IN FRONT OF CARS during a green light to cross over to me. Honestly I didn’t think much of it until he tapped my wrist and gestured for me to take my earbud out. I did and then it’s a spew of “wow, I couldn’t help but notice your beauty and...” and I panic and start walking away. I had to keep turning every block or so to make sure he wasn’t following me, I was still on edge when I started writing this. For everyone here I would love to share some words of wisdom: when a woman — or anyone really — is walking alone (I don’t care if it’s night or day) approaching them while they are alone is already a bit sus and TOUCHING THEM is an absolute no. It’s not flattering, it’s invading personal space. Also — if you do happen to compliment someone in this setting — you are not entitled to a reaction.

n0s58t,The ASUW-Daily spat - more than you think. Recall Camille Hattwig,"The other posts on this are missing the bigger picture - ASUW president Camille Hattwig used the allegations of racism to draw attention away from The Daily's reporting on her nearly fraudulent election practices.

Here's how it down in the context of the election:

1. ASUW doesn't advertise deadlines or other info for the upcoming election so it consists entirely of ASUW insiders running unopposed
2. The Daily calls them out for this
3. Camille fabricates allegations of racism against the Daily to try to delegitimize their very reasonable concerns about the election. In her (somewhat alarmist) email to the entire student body about this, she leaves out any specifics because then people would see that her claims are ridiculous.

I know ASUW is kinda a joke, but it's entirely inappropriate for an elected incumbent to try to delegitimize reasonable criticism from the press about an election. And something really did go wrong with this election - 100% of positions consisting of unopposed insiders shows they used unfair pre-election processes.

Camille should be recalled for this - if any of you know how to get that started we should work on that.

nakstt,RANDOM ADVICE FOR FRESHMEN,"here is a random jumble of advice and info I wish i knew/thought of before coming to UW (much of this is dorm related)

 

* 8 am in high school is very different from 8 am in college. Unless you are absolutely sure that you are a morning person--like the type of person who wakes up at 6 a.m.--do not take classes before 10 a.m.! 
* Get the lowest level dining account. If you find you need more money you can always level your account up, but if you start with an expensive dining account and you don't spend the money, you're screwed.
* You might not like your roommates. It's fine. Even if you talk to them for months before, sometimes it just doesn't work out and that's okay. It happens to a lot of people.
* Closet measurements: that rack for hanging your clothes is 32 inches. (hope this helps y'all not overpack)
* Worried about storage space? Grab yourself one of these bad boys at a very reasonable price from target: https://www.target.com/p/11-8-cube-organizer-shelf-room-essentials-153/-/A-51256587?preselect=15113339#lnk=sametab 
* Don't know who needs to hear this, but you do not need to bring that many pairs of shoes. 
* Bring several towels. Ideally thinner ones so they dry properly.
* Clothes you *need*:  a good rain jacket. Ideally two. Two pairs of rain shoes, either waterproof or water-resistant. That's right, you will thank me for this.
* Don't bring tide pods. The washers don't get hot enough for them to melt. 
* Bringing posters? Scotch mounting putty works great for hanging them on dorm walls! Tape… not so much. 
* Get a minifridge, get a good one! You do not really need a microwave, every dorm floor has two microwaves so you're not going to have to walk super forward to access a fancy and high-quality microwave. 
* You will in fact need a power cord--the outlets are few and far spread so if you plan on having a lamp, your computer, a clock, and phone plugged in at your desk, you will need this. 
* Buy one of those eye masks for sleeping and practice sleeping in it. Well look stupid and it's not the most comfortable at first, you and your roommate will thank me when it's 2 a.m. and you want to sleep, and they need to have the lights on so they can stay awake and cram study for a test.  no matter the brightness or what time of day it is, you put that sucker on, and it's pitch black and perfect for sleeping.
* there is no AC in the dorms. you have a heater in your room but the highest I can go is 74 degrees. It autoshuts on at 55 degrees. Thus far it has not gotten hot enough that I would want AC but just a heads up it isn't an option.
* Bring lights. Lamps, string lights, anything. The dorm lighting sucks and the rooms are so gloomy, dark, and depressing. 
* There will be very little daylight during the winter months. Some days, if you sleep in late and wake up at 3 p.m, you open your blinds to find it is already dark outside. During these months make sure you get up and experience a few hours of sunlight a day or you will get seasonal depression. It's very real, and it sucks. 
* ALEKS is evil. Learn to fear and hate the name, chances are you'll understand later. 
* Sometimes there are homeless people wandering around West Campus. Most of them are chill, some of them are weird. Sometimes the front of the dorm buildings smells like human urine.
* The dining hall food sucks. Buy yourself a pan, pot, spatula, knife, mixing bowl, and cutting board from target or Ikea or somewhere in case you ever cook. That's honestly about all you need....
* Bring a vacuum. And a duster. The dorm's floors get so dirty so fast, and the room gets so damn dusty from the vents. 
* Do not overload your schedule! College classes are a lot more self-taught than High School. Balance is important, for everyone hard class you're taking, balance it with a passion class or a fun class your first quarter to allow yourself breathing room to adjust. Pair your chem class with a film appreciation class or psychology of human sexuality, and your bio class with ceramics or creative writing. You get the idea.
* Do not hook up with someone on your dorm hall floor, rookie mistake and it is awkward for the whole year. I did not do it but I know too many people who did eek

t8bcvt,It's that time: the annual 'go to community college (seriously)' plea,"The post title is tongue-in-cheek, but hear me out. There's a lot of sincerity in people telling you to do this.

It's admissions season, and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're one of thousands of freshmen who didn't make the cut for admissions this year. And that sucks. There's no diminishing it, especially if you're like many UW students who were a part of some Honors or AP program that was priming you for the Straight to College pipeline, and telling you that anything less was abject failure.

(Or maybe you just have Asian parents.)

I'm here to tell you why community college is a perfectly valid path that'll still bring you to the UW, how to make it work for you, and if I'm doing a good job, you might come to find it was the smarter decision anyway. This is coming from someone who applied to UW in his senior year of high school and, having finished that last semester with a 1.7 GPA, predictably did not get in. It was pretty devastating: high school sucked, and as a little baby gay, I couldn't see myself being happy anywhere but Seattle. I applied again a decade later (you don't need to wait this long) having job experience, an AA earned with highest honors, and a much clearer direction of where I wanted to take my life - and these have been among the best years of my life because of it. So not only am I writing this to the freshmen who were hyped and pumped up to get here, but I'm also writing to people who also have started to wonder if college was in reach for them *at all*: because of their abilities, because of a garbage high school experience, because their family is poor, etc. **You can make it happen.**

I work with other CC transfer students *a lot*. It's not all sunshine and daisies, but there are minimal regrets - and a number of commonly-cited reasons as to why community college was the best decision for them:

**1)** **$$$**

The big one everyone will talk about is money, and for good reason: **a single 5-credit course at UW costs about as much as a full-time quarter at a WA state community college.** On the whole, you're going to spend about a third as much on your first two years compared to someone who went straight to UW. Unless your family is already wealthy, this is a pretty attractive point to anyone - and it's half the reason why, as a first-gen student, grad school is even a future possibility for me. 

Bonus for OOS (non-international) students: CC tuition isn't that much more expensive for you compared to the baseline (~$130/cred vs. $116/cred), while UW would have you paying 3-4x as much - to the point that many will tell you to just not come here OOS unless you're mega-wealthy. For OOS students, this can be a great opportunity to establish yourself & work towards residency, but that is a *whole ass process* you'll want to talk to the professionals about.

Further: community colleges usually have foundations that collect and hand out scholarships like candy to students with big aspirations, while here the odds can be so long you might have a better chance fighting the other applicants to the death in the gladiator pit under Condon Hall.

**2)** **Better Academics**

Big prerequisite classes for more competitive majors - math, bio, chem, the works - are colloquially called 'weedouts', with pretty brutal exams and grading curves. A quick search on this sub will show you what the experience is like. Many of these can be taken at a CC and transferred in - and you'll probably have a more accessible professor, classroom aides, and a class size about a tenth of what you'd find here. Even current UW students will often dip a CC course during the summer just to avoid how utterly miserable they can be here.

Beyond skipping weedouts, WA state CCs are among the best in the country. Many CC professors very much teach foremost out of a passion for helping their students.  For the first time in my life, I didn't hate math, and I was able to ace statistics - which was unthinkable for me at the time (and UW straight up taught me to hate it again anyways lmaoo). I took biology with a professor who I later learned had began at that same community college, went to UW for undergrad microbio with awards for research excellence, and went on to get his PhD. He played chill Hollow Knight ambience during our exam days. Honestly, I'll probably remember more of my CC profs than my UW ones by the time I'm in my career field.

**3)** **Easier Accessibility**

This is a broad one, but: unless you're taking out loans or coasting on your parent's dime in the dorms, making an education happen at UW is *hard*. Seattle has a high cost of living and many students have to live outside and commute 1-2h every day. Prior to the pandemic, the university basically went out of its way to *not* offer online courses, while many CCs have them as a staple. The time and money you save just by not having to struggle to *be* here are resources you can put into yourself, your extracurriculars, and planning out your transfer to make the most of your time here.

**4)** **Lots of involvement opportunities**

This is true at UW, too, but it's just more accessible here. Become a student leader, go work with student life, get hired as a tutor, join a robotics club. Tied in with the Accessibility bit above, you'll have more room on your plate to volunteer or intern somewhere. CC is no different from UW in this regard, though: to make these things happen, you have to go search for them. People will tell you that the degree you get here matters a lot less than the connections you made or the opportunities you embraced, and IMO that same message rings true for your community college experience.

**5)** **Life perspective**

This one is ambiguous, but bear with me. My very first community college class was English 101. I sat a table with an international student from Japan, a 40-year-old military veteran who was working on getting a degree in machining, and a woman in her late 20s who I later learned had been on the streets for about a year before transitional housing became available for her. By the time the quarter started, she'd been off the streets for just a month. In the span of her two years there, she'd go on to study IT and get an internship with T Mobile, who later hired her for about $70k starting.

When you sit in a stuffy lecture hall at UW with a bunch of college-bound kids from career college families, you rarely get these kind of stories. You don't get the same perspective on how 'Success' can mean different things to different people, how it's equally as valid, and the sacrifices some people have to make in order to make their education happen. Where's UW on the US News College Rankings? What's your SAT score? Did you apply to Ivies? At that table, *nobody fucking cared*. It's hard to describe how valuable that lesson is: the way it changes how you see and interact with other people, how it reframes your perspective on yourself and your education, and what it all means to you. You've probably spent 4 years on a rat-race gifted high schooler track; step off it, just for a little while.

This experience translates to your time at UW in a way that professors notice, too. Professors fucking love transfer students. They've got life experience, tend to be less full of anxiety and bullshit, and are often among the best participators in their classrooms. Student & campus jobs will love you, too. There's transfer shock, sure, but when you get here, a lot of transfers feel pretty ahead of the pack, and if they planned their transfer well they get to drop right into the heart of their major's core classes.

----

Getting through your two years at CC is one thing, but if you can do that, honestly the path forward is simple:

1. Use your time at CC to explore majors and figure out what you want to do.
2. Take some time to think about how your desired career path impacts the world, or a problem or disadvantaged communities in it. There's a world beyond academia: engage with it.
3. Get involved, somewhere. Bonus points if it's tied into the above. Think about how that's relevant to your desired career path.
4. Go to class. Get those grades.
5. Write a bomb-ass essay that ties all the above together, and show them how dumb they'd have to be to *not* take you.

If you have your heart set here, for whatever reason, and didn't make it in: go to community college. Seriously. I hope the ramblings of a former lost teen help at least one person out there also feeling like a lost teen today.",Admissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/t8bcvt/its_that_time_the_annual_go_to_community_college/,26,314

lkfa1d,Protecting the health of students learning in different time zones: a letter to the UW administration,"*This message is being sent to Ana Mari Cauce (the President of UW), the Daily of UW, and the general audience.*

Dear UW Administrators,

I am writing this letter to raise awareness of the challenges on the health of student learning in different time zones. In this letter, I present those challenges and potential solutions to mitigate those problems. I invite the UW administration to take actions to address those challenges to build a more inclusive global community.

**Executive Summary**

Amid the pandemic, many students have to learn in different time zones synchronously under current university policy, compromising their health. University policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced to protect the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones. Established policies such as the elimination of attendance for grading need to be enforced. Policy changes should focus on making time schedules of assessments and discussion sessions more flexible.

**Background**

Amid COVID-19 pandemic, students have to stay at home and learn remotely in different time zones inside and outside of the US. Most international students, especially, experience drastic time differences when trying to attend lectures and exams live from their home countries.

Attending classes live with hours of difference is not easy. For students studying in Hawaii, a 8:30 am PST class translates to attendance at 6:30 am local time. For students studying in East Asia, a 10:30 am PST class could mean staying up late 2:30 pm \[correction: am\] late night every weekday. Such time difference not only translates to disadvantages when learning materials and taking exams, it also disturbs the students’ circadian clock, causing adverse effects on the student’s physical and mental health.

The adverse effects are not theoretical, nor are they overstated. On February 8th, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute grieves the passing of Kaijie Zhang, “a first-semester freshman studying remotely from his family home in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China” \[1\]. Taking classes at night and its associated adverse effects are allegedly the main cause of this tragedy. To prevent such tragedies from happening at UW and for the health of all students learning in different time zones, university policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced. I am confident that these problems will be addressed because “the health and safety of our students, staff, faculty and academic personnel is our University’s highest priority,” writes our President Ana Mari Cauce in her message “The safety of our community is our highest priority” \[2\].

**Problems and Recommendations**

*Time Schedule Planning*

While synchronous classes with diverse time schedules and asynchronous classes could solve the problem, they are not realistic in large scale because of limited teaching resources and limited learning experience, respectively. However, I suggest the university to explicitly encourage the planning of lecture and quiz sections (if they have multiple sections) at very different times.

For instance, many courses currently offers section A at 9:30 am and section B at 10:30 am, providing students little time flexibility. Instead, the policy could encourage planning of section A at 9:30 am and section B at 4:30 pm, accommodating for students from different time zones.

I understand that such strategy may not work for all courses because of limitations such as their sizes, instructor availability, and time conflicts. Nevertheless, a small change in the schedule could benefit a large population of students. In addition, FERPA-compliant recordings of synchronous lecture should be required to be uploaded to the cloud for students all students for reference, giving all student the possibility of asynchronous learning.

*Exam Policy*

Another issue that students learning from different time zones face is awkward exam schedule. If a course is offered synchronously, regardless whether its materials are posted for asynchronous learning, its exams are usually strictly synchronous, without exceptions (other than that required by university policy). For example, a student studying from East Asia may have to take an exam 3:30 am local time at night for an unnegotiable exam time of 11:30 am PST. Again, such late time is not only an disadvantage to academic performance, but it is also poisonous to the students’ physical and mental health. This is easily understandable: if student do not expect instructors to teach late night to accommodate for students in different time zones, then instructors should not expect students in different time zones to take examinations late night.

As a concrete example, many exams in the Department of Chemistry must be taken synchronously, without exceptions for students learning in different time zones, because instructors “see less issues with academic ethics & integrity if all students take the exam concurrently.” Even worse, it is quoted as a departmental policy. This would not be a problem if classes were in person, but remote instruction has to consider of time zone differences to be inclusive of students learning in different time zones.

Synchronous exam policies have to be changed. I recommend exams for remote learning to have a time window of 24 hours to start the exam, providing students from different time zones an equal opportunity to perform in their time zones. Indeed, such policy may raise concerns on academic integrity; however, policies should not punish students who did nothing wrong: the time zone students are in are not in their control. In contrast, the choice to adhere to the honor code and take the exam with honesty is in the hands of every student. In addition, student who decide to cheat in asynchronous exams is likely to cheat in synchronous section regardless, having no correlation with whether students learning from different time zones should have a fair time to take the exam. Therefore, exam policies need to be changed so that every student has an equal opportunity to demonstrate their performance and a healthy schedule without late night classes.

*Enforcement of Policies*

After appropriate revision to the university policies, those policies need to be strictly enforced so that the students can benefit from those policies to have a flexible learning experience. If no enforcement is placed and no feedback channel is available for students, students would not be benefitted from those policies. Thus, I recommend the university to establish ways for students to provide feedback and express concerns on remote teaching related to course policies to the administration level (independent to those mid-quarter survey that are for instructional feedback).

*Attendance Policy*

Here, I present one example of the consequence of the lack of policy enforcement: the attendance policy is not practiced by instructors. The university policy on remote teaching has a clear guideline on grading synchronous attendance: “Attendance – Don’t factor in attendance as part of grading” \[3\]. However, many instructors still grade attendance directly or indirectly. Take an Organic Chemistry course as an example, its grading takes synchronous Poll Everywhere responses as 4% of the total grade, stating that “you will only be able to answer the questions during lecture, not while watching the lectures on Panopto later on,” forcing students to attend synchronously without considering students learning in different time zones. As a solution, I recommend quarterly inspection of course syllabus as a part of policy enforcement, in the hope that instructors will follow university policies, just like students should follow university policies, too.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, university policies need to be revised and enforced so that the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones can be protected. The change to university policies can also provide more equitable examination opportunities. I invite the UW administration to respond by taking concrete actions to improve the policies, building a more inclusive community.

This last year though I really started trying to get my crap together, and I really started to just focus on what I wanted to do instead of what I was expected to do. It wasn’t a perfect year but my gpa slowly recovered. After all my hard work and finally being told that I belong here.

gg7sy7,From Cheating in CSE 143 to a Full Time Programming Role,"**As I am seeing that many admission decisions are coming out I thought now would be a good time to share the (success) story of my journey at UW, which is coming to an end this quarter.**

  
Like many hopefuls I came into the UW hoping to do Computer Science. I had built my own computer in High School, I thought coding was fascinating, I saw that it was a field that was employable and paid well. Like many up until I started at UW I didn't really realize the work it took to be successful, and I wasn't prepared for the competitive nature that UW cultivates. 

By the end of **my first year** I knew I would never be a CS student. I took CSE 143 that winter with my roommate, we were both struggling on an assignment and he sent me an ""example"" of a past quarter's submission found online. As I soon found out, you can change every single variable name and you will still get caught. The program they run is able to see the structure of the code and compares it to their database of submissions. That crushed me, and was one of the hardest lessons I had to learn my Freshman year. Having to own up to my own mistake and look past it shook my world for the better. We both got caught and I don't blame my roommate at all.

I was able to finish the prerequisite courses to Informatics just in time to apply my Freshman year. I wrote a piss-poor essay which I was revising with 10 minutes left to the deadline. In retrospect of course I'm not surprised at all that I wasn't admitted, but at the time I was still partially in the mindset that life would just work out for me. 

After getting rejected my **Sophomore year** with an actually well written and revised essay I was heartbroken. In my head I still was set on Info as my backup major and didn't have another backup, I didn't have the prerequisites or grades for ACMS or any Math heavy major. A friend of mine had recommended GIS in Geography as a tech-related alternative and by the end of the year I was a declared Geography Major. I still wanted to program for a living and still was hoping to get into Info my Junior year. I had it calculated that I could take Info classes on the side and still graduate in 4 years if I was admitted then.

So many students I see on this sub-reddit put an incredible emphasis on getting into their major. Which is a great goal to work towards, but it isn't the ""end all be all""! I finally came to realize around this point that *my Major wasn't what was going to get me that desired job after college, it was the skills was able to gain and retain from my studies*. This was when I got my first internship paying minimum wage at a research center downtown to help add data visualizations to their website. I got this through applying to nearly every data science related *Undergraduate Research Program listing.*

For my **Junior year** Informatics essay I was actually so ticked at the system that my essay was about how my Major and grades don't define my capabilities in life. haha! Long story short I didn't get in then either, and was officially going to be graduating as a Geography Major. I continued to take Informatics and the non-major CSE courses that I was able to get into and began applying like crazy to internship roles for the next summer. I likely *applied to over 100 roles mostly on sites like Glassdoor*. I got my second internship at a recreational equipment company working on their employee management system/database. Around this time I also secured a part-time engineering internship at a telecommunications giant that would go throughout my senior school year. When I applied and accepted these Internships my resume still had Informatics as my intended major even though I was denied from the program a few weeks afterwards. 

This might apply to tech more than other majors but *don't think that because you didn't get into your major you aren't qualified or able to get that role you want or be successful in the future*. Fight through it and apply everywhere! **Work experience is so much more valuable than any major title or course.** 

The Geography major is not incredibly technical and even though I'm seeing this Data Science option that has been recently added to it, after looking at the courses, it's not that much more intensive. Geography courses all hold your hand through the material and if you do major in I highly recommend going above and beyond. I was able to take every single non-major CSE course except for AI and the photography one. In Informatics I was able to get the Android, iOS, and Server-side courses (don't take professionalism), many people assumed I was in the major.

For a while I regretted not transferring when the Geography major initially disappointed me, but in retrospect two factors made staying worth it, the reduced in-state tuition (probably saved over $50,000 in debt), and simply *the amount of opportunities in Seattle*. All my internships were located in Seattle and being able to be at school so close gave me the opportunities to go to interviews (of which I got rejected from many) and eventually find internships. 

This Summer I start work full time as a Diagnostics Engineer writing programs that monitor and help to maintain cell phone service around the country, I get to work with massive amounts of data, and am making a 6 figure salary right out of college. To everyone who has been rejected from any major, know that it isn't the end of the world and you can and will bounce back.

n1x6tf,(Semi-opiniated) summary of last nights ASUW BOD meeting,"During the first \~15 minutes, some BSU representatives speak and thank Camille and the ASUW board for their ""professionalism."" Followed by member of the public asking ASUW why they sent a mass alarmist email to tens of thousands of people. Camille says they're ""not doing back-and-forth"" and doesn't provide a response. (I'm unclear if this is standard for public forums, so maybe give her the benefit of the doubt here?)

Bulk of the meeting (over an hour) was about pretty standard/hiring/administrative stuff. 

Time was allocated at the end for the board to discuss The Daily. One of the board members asked about the email, why it was sent out, and who knew about it. Camille said she met with ""all relevant stakeholders"" prior to the email being sent. Board member pushes a bit more on the stakeholders question, Camille says it's not an appropriate discussion for a board meeting.

Board member asks if she met with The Daily, as they are a relevant stakeholder. Camille waffles a bit, and says that yes, The Daily was consulted prior to the mass email being sent. 

(Wild accusation: based on the context here, I got the feeling that she was misrepresenting the truth. The Daily's response doesn't really line up with what she was saying here, and she made it very clear that she was more concerned with stakeholders other than The Daily. )

Camille speaks about her rationale for sending the email. She argued that since the original racist cartoon was sent to every student, she needed to send a follow-up response to every student. Says that it's important to ""show support for the students being harmed by the institutions at play."" 

(Look, I don't know about the rest of you, but I regularly see The Daily in my inbox. I don't regularly see alarmist emails from the ASUW president. There was no fucking reason to send this spam to everyone.)

She went on and explained that the BOD candidates have the least amount of power in this situation, because The Daily can reach tens of thousands of people, so she felt compelled to use her power to do the same to support the candidates. She said her biggest concern and the point of her statement was not ""what the public thinks,"" its the impact this has had on Black students. ""The goal was not to explain things clearly or make the broader student community understand.""

(It's true the candidates don't have access to a mailing list of the student body. But they will next year. To put it another way, they're unopposed candidates for public office, they are guaranteed to have power next year, no matter what The Daily does or says. It's frankly mind-boggling, then, that the current administration thinks its appropriate to step into this fight use their power to attack the press.)

Camille starts talking about next steps for ASUW, and what steps they can take to ""never worry again about students of color being targeted."" The board discusses options for potentially taking further actions against The Daily, specifically options to censure/censor The Daily.

(Okay, the wording is really important here, and even with context, I'm honestly not sure if they were talking about censuring or censoring. Regardless, either would effectively be a government action against the free press).

Then the board start talking about how much they appreciate The Daily's independent reporting. Camille says that critiquing the ASUW is well within The Daily's right (yet they continue talking about ""accountability"" measures.) The meeting mostly winds down after this.

Overall, I'm unhappy with ASUW's conduct and their attacks on The Daily are concerning at best. Curious if anyone else who attended the meeting has additional thoughts.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1x6tf/semiopiniated_summary_of_last_nights_asuw_bod/,27,300

I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. 

This random guy suddenly appeared and interrupted her by saying, ""Excuse me."" He looked like he was trying to get past her into our building. I guess she got spooked, she finally turned around and left. The guy waited in the doorway until she walked away and asked me if I was okay. He then walked out of the building and left.

It was only after I got inside the elevator that I calmed down and realized he intentionally intervened to save me. I don't even remember if I thanked him.

ewwhzn,Shoutout to a police officer on 12th and 41st,"So I’m waiting for a chance to cross the unmarked two-lane crosswalk at 12th, and the cars aren’t stopping. Then a police car comes along, brakes, and turns on all its lights to signal the other cars to stop. The cars in the second lane don’t seem to get the idea, so the police car actually drives a bit diagonally into the other lane to block them from going. This allows me and another student to cross the road safely.

I don’t know if that was legal, sir, but it was very appreciated.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ewwhzn/shoutout_to_a_police_officer_on_12th_and_41st/,6,294

Getting out of the IMA at 6:30 to see it's already dark, but knowing you and the boys have a move ready for that Friday night.

The random orange street lights around campus giving off that Halloween vibe, building up anticipation for the weekend coming at the end of October.

Shivering your ass off as you hustle through the bus-noisy streets at 8:20am.

Eating shit outside of Kane Hall because of a smooth leafy boy and having people to stare at you (as opposed to how empty it would be now. Eating shit not as fun when people don't watch).

per9vl,An open letter the University of Washington,"The University of Washington has condemned me and other disabled students with immune deficiency, as well as their families. Every 12 hours I take two medications to prevent my body from recognizing foreign solid organs that I received as part of a transplant. Because of this, I am more susceptible to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, something I have known for a long time. What many don’t know is that an additional consequence of these medications is reduced vaccine efficacy. I have received two doses, a booster, and have had COVID-19, and I still lack the antibodies to fight the disease.

The University of Washington, like many other universities across the country, has opted for in-person learning this fall. Most students and faculty are eager for the opportunity to be back on campus. However, the harsh reality for some is that the options provided by the university are subpar, dangerous, and are directly against access to learning for all students. I know I am not the only student with an immune deficiency, and I know that there are students with family members who are immune deficient.

The options before myself, as presented by the DRS, are as follows: hope that professors are willing to alter their course structures significantly to accommodate a single student, take less courses, request accommodations through the DRS which they have stated will be extremely limited and hard to acquire, or take the quarter off. Most of these place undue stress on students and instructors, both emotionally as well as financially.

With little over a month until the beginning of fall quarter, myself and my living partner have had no access to resources to protect ourselves from COVID-19 on campus. I have options, as listed above, however, my partner  — who sleeps next to me — has been told that there are no options for them, because they have no disability, making what little accommodations provided to myself useless so long as my partner must return to in-person learning.

I thank all the professors and advisors who’ve been corresponding with my partner and I this summer, trying to help in any way possible, and informing us that the university refuses to provide professors with guidance and resources for specific cases. This is the direct responsibility of the university, to provide guidance for student and faculty guidance, and reassurances that they will support all types of learning to guarantee that students can become educated in the safest and most effective way possible.

So while summer winds its way to a close and we continue to sit at home keeping our minds and bodies as active in any safe manner possible, the fall looms with unanswered questions, anxiety about more than assignments, and a sadness that the university I was once so proud to be a part of has become such a risk.

12xskne,My personal Ave foods tier list,"Happy to see some discussion over food on the ave, I've kept track of every meal I had on the ave in the past three years. The reason Seattle has no Michelin star restaurants is because there hasn't been a PNW Michelin guide, so there hasn't been an opportunity for any places to earn a star. Also, I use Aladdin's as the dividing line between A-tier and B-tier. I usually end up changing what I think of a place when I try more of their menu, so if there I particular dishes I have missed/should try, please let me know!  


A Tier:

YGF Malatang

I used to think I wasn't a soup guy, but a bowl of this on a cold, rainy day is one of my favorite meals in Seattle. I basically got a little bit of every option the first time, which ended up being pretty expensive, but still delicious. Haven't tried all the seafood, but in general I liked everything but the various meatballs/sausage. Highly recommend the gourd, tiny mushrooms, and the greens that look like chrysanthemum leaves for things I wasn't sure I'd like and ended up loving.

Chili's South Indian

Lamb Chettinadu Curry: Very good chicken, perfectly tender, perfectly spicy. Very flavorful. Portions were a little small, especially for the price. Had the chicken version later with a friend, also delicious

Malabar Chicken Curry: Had more veggies than the Chettinadu curry, which I liked. Also delicious.

The Alley

Spicy Pork Skillet: Everything was delicious, a lot of good sides. Second best value in a meal besides Saigon deli, but I think the price went up since the first time I've been there

Bugis

Hot Spicy Chicken Bowl: Delicious. Salad with good dressing, teriyaki chicken, rice, pickled onion, boiled egg. Fairly small portion of chicken and rice, salad was simple but very good. Whole dish came together great.

Vegetarian Tofu Bowl (spicy, noodles): Pretty good, the second-best vegetarian meal I've had on campus. Pretty standard egg noodle in spicy teriyaki sauce with broccoli and carrots. Outside of the tofu was really good, what really brought down the dish was that the broccoli, tofu, and sliced boiled egg were cold. You can solve this by letting the dish sit for a little, but it's still off-putting.

Mama's Viet Kitchen

Seitan Lemongrass: The greatest vegan dish I've ever had. When the dish came out, I was initially hesitant, as I don't usually eat vegetarian, and I like having a good amount of meat to go with my veggies. As it got closer, the smell hit me, and it was absolutely incredible. The vegetables also looked pretty great up close. On tasting them, they were perfectly, truly perfectly, seasoned and cooked. The only request I would make would be to serve the veggies right on top of the rice, so the rice has more time to soak up the flavor.

Chimac

Assorted Wings: Quality of the meat was really high, sauces weren't that good, dry rub was way better. Skip the corn. Pride chicken is delicious, chicken tenders are good, snow wings are a really good dry rub

Cedar's

Naan was pretty good, samosas were really good, lots of filling. Chicken was very tender.

Village Sushi

Sushi Regular: Good variety, it was all delicious. The wasabi was very good.

Shultzy's

French Dip Cheesesteak: Coleslaw was vinegary, fries were very thin, which was good but hard to eat non-messily with ketchup. Excellent meat quality and quantity, perfectly balanced with onion and swiss cheese, bread and au jus was great, they only give you half a roll which wasn't great for the price.

Jai Thai UW

Crispy Garlic Chicken: Delicious. Chicken was very good, perfectly crunchy, saucy without being soggy. Vegetables were perfectly cooked, the carrots, broccoli, and other greens were delicious. The entire dish came together fantastically.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

B Tier:

Aladdin Gyro-Cery

Aladdin Veggie Roll: Not great. Falafel was delicious, but the whole roll was a little dry and flavorless. The baklava was large, and pretty good.

Aladdin's Special Gyro(Lamb and Beef): Very good, a bit less greasy and more salad-y than Sultan Gyro Grill, could be a plus or minus depending on the person. Ratio of meat to sauce to pita to greens was perfect, meat was tender and salty, garlic sauce was very good.

Falafel Sandwich: Surprisingly little falafel, incredibly dry, not very saucy. Basically a falafel salad sandwich.

Kofta Sandwich: Not good, basically just a burger patty with tahini

Aladdin Fries(lamb): Delicious, lamb was perfectly tender with a thin but excellent crunch around the outside. Drink water with it or you'll mummify, maybe a few too many fries but some people love the fries so who knows

Voula's Offshore Cafe

Little Squeaker Sandwich and Potato Salad: Very good, meat was a bit thin and not tender, but flavorful. Bread was good, and soaked up the perfect sauciness. Tomato went well with it, and I don't like tomatoes. Potato salad was balanced between creamy and firm, I really liked the red onion in it.

Country Fried Steak: Eggs were good, hashbrowns were decent, english muffins were very good. Gravy was alright, country fried steak was alright, a bit salty but it goes well with the egg and hashbrowns.

Costa's

Original Eggs Benedict: Really good, I don't really like ham but it was still good, that's how good it was.

Next to try: Kotopita + Galaktoboureko

Ivar's Walk-Up Salmon Bar

Chowder Bowl, Fried Scallops, Fried Clams: Pretty good greasy spoon fare, view out front isn't great, bridge is very loud

Henry's Taiwanese Kitchen

Three Cup Chicken: Pretty good, rice in the sauce was delicious and the greens were good, but the chicken wasn't very tender. It was like a very sweet soy sauce, but not quite teriyaki.

Pho Shizzle

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki: Good size, chicken was a bit too crispy for me, flavor of the teriyaki wasn't great, could have had more salad. The side sauces were really good.

The Alley

Spicy Pork Bulgogi: Pretty good overall, good presentation

Byrek and Baguette

Ground Beef Byrek: Meat pastry, blackened around the edges, cold by the time it was served.

Roasted Pork Baguette: Delicious, reminds me of Un Bien, maybe not quite as good but also a lot less messy, so easier to eat without feeling self conscious.

Kai's Thai Street Food

Pad Kra Tiem: Pretty good, not really very memorable though.

Sultan Gyro Grill

Kufta: Alright. A little greasy and salty, hot sauce was good, great texture overall.

U:Don

Pretty greasy noodles, good prices on some items. Not exactly fine dining, but still pleasant comfort food.

Mee Sum Pastry

Mongolian Beef: Solid Beef + Onion dish, very tender beef

Sweet Alchemy Ice Cream

Sweet Cream: I'm not an ice cream person, but it's the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had.

H-Mart

Only place I've found Meiji chocolates, so it gets an honorary spot on the list

Saint Bread

Saint Burger and Cookie: Saint burger was a single patty, shredded lettuce, cheese, pickles, aioli. Best buns I've ever had, perfectly toasty. Excellent, simple burger.

Been back with friends a few other times, I think the burger's the best thing I've had

&#x200B;

C Tier:

Saigon Deli:

BBQ Pork Sandwich: Delicious bread, egg was a little runny. Great ratios of ingredients, bbq pork wasn't noteable.

Aladdin's Burgers

Beef and Lamburgghini: Decent smash burgers

Little Duck

Beef Fried Rice, Mushroom and Chicken Soup, Hot and Spicy Chicken: Soup was good, the rest wasn't great. Lots of bone pieces in the soup, hot and spicy chicken is basically spicy chicken nuggets.

Shawarma King

Lamb Shawarma Sandwich, Basbousa: Delicious, kind of a lamb burrito, perfectly flavorful and saucy. Basbousa was kinda gritty, but was also moist with a honey-sweet syrup, very good.

Lamb Salad: Not very good, salad was cold and wet which cooled down the lamb, the lamb was not very tender

Gyro Sandwich: Not good, nothing about it tasted great or really worked with any other ingredient

Chocolate Roll: Not very chocolatey, more of a fig-newtony kind of roll. Probably on the level of a nutrigrain bar.

Agua Verde Cafe

Chicken Burrito: Creamy, but the chicken wasn't very flavorful. Small for the price.

Chorizo Breakfast burrito: The thermal temperature of this burrito was sufficient to plasmify the air around me for ten minutes. The burrito was cheesy and greasy, not bad, a bit heavy for breakfast.

A Taste of Xi'an

Bean soup, hot oil pulled noodle: Pretty good, was definitely something new. Might try skewers next time

Mr. Bian Dumplings

Bian Dumplings, Pork and shrimp dumplings: A bit expensive for the volume. Shrimp wasn't very flavorful, bian dumplings were better. Overall kind of plain.

Guanaco's Pupuseria

Pretty small, good variety of flavors

Xi'an Noodles

Spicy Pork Noodles: Service time was pretty long, presentation is pretty poor but the taste is pretty good. Kind of felt like I could make it at home though.

BB's Teriyaki

Veggie Stir Fry, Brown Rice, Spicy Chicken, Spicy Sauce: Decent portion size. A little greasy, generally forgettable. Veggie stir fry was just wilted salad, skip.

Mark's Thai Food Box

Pork Ribs: Not great. Curry and rice wasn't very good, ribs were neither meaty nor tender. Dish was a little cold overall, the egg was the best fried egg I'd ever had.

Jewel of India

Mixed Grill, Lamb Samosas, Chicken Jalfrazie, Gulab Jamun: Mixed grill and jalfrazie was alright, nothing special. Samosas were really good, Gulab Jamun was too cardamom-y for my taste.

Nasai Teriyaki

Spicy Chicken: Pretty basic chicken teriyaki. Was made very quickly, which I like. A lot of people seem to really like it, maybe I got the wrong dish?

Ate O'Clock Thai

Hot Spicy Thai Basil: Not very spicy, veggies were alright but meat was fairly poor quality. Not worth the price.

Just Burgers

Tennessee w/ Curly Fries: A little overcooked, sauces were good and onion was delicious, but overall very greasy.

Thanh Vi

Banh Mi Combo: Short for a Banh Mi, the most generic Banh Mi I've ever eaten

Araya's Place

Veggie Cakes, Kaeng Ka-Ri: Good vegan food, and large portions, but incredibly expensive

Dubpop Asian Fusion

General Tao's Chicken: Not very good flavor on the sauce, pretty good serving size for the price.

Chipotle

Pollo Asada: They'll give you too much rice and beans if you let them put both on. Otherwise, pretty good burrito, Anita's on Aurora (and El Camion) are way better

Korean Tofu House Express

Bibimbap: Not a lot of meat, but sauce was good, so way rice + veggies. 

Time Bistro

Garlic Chicken and Rocket Shrimp Wraps: Bland, nothing special

Samurai Noodle

Tonkatsu Ramen: Not great. Salty/creamy isn't really my thing, the pickled veggie and pork weren't great, and the noodles were a little too squishy.

Cedars of Lebanon

Marinated Chicken Sandwich: A little bland, kind of like a chicken salad sandwich.

Panda Noodles

Veggie Fried Rice: A little heavy on the soy sauce, otherwise a standard bowl of fried rice.

Little Thai Restaurant

Clao Cook Gapi and Fish Cakes: Fish cakes rather bland, not very crispy. Egg was overcooked, maybe a bit too much rice for the beef, the portion was good overall but maybe not for the price. Beef was pretty good, got the second-spiciest level and it wasn't very spicy. They do have a fish tank, which is a huge plus.

Sushi Burrito

Dragon Ball: Criminally overpriced, even with the uw guide coupon. Pretty good, and didn't skimp on the eel, the shrimp didn't really add anything.

Samir's Mediterranean

Lamb Gyro: Spicy meat, a little bland on the whole",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/12xskne/my_personal_ave_foods_tier_list/,60,278

if they can send us cloth masks that people still use today, why can't they send us n-95's to protect us all? the inaccessibility to n-95's is so wrong...

e5sdhq,Daily Review: Burrito at Center Table,"Dear HFS,

On my post yesterday you said to continue sharing our feedback, I feel obliged: please accept my following review.

I got a beef burrito today, which soon became a bowl thanks to the creative wrapping. I quite liked it, the quantity was good.

However if I were to try improve on your recipe I would use a tortilla which isn't stale.

I might also find that it would be quicker and cheaper to go to Chipotle. Which is quite impressive considering both the distance and their desire to make a profit. 

I do also find it amazing that on ordering a sandwich you can get free avocado spread, but guacamole costs $2 in a burrito. I assume this must be due to the immense costs of the differing tools required in application. I might suggest trying to use the same spoon in the future? Just a thought.

Keep up the scam,

sometimes this randomly happens throughout the rest of the quarter, and each time, especially when it happens multiple times in the same day, is just as painful.
and when you try to join in, they treat you like a baldheaded cretin off rip, or they politely entertain your presence with a “yeah i’m gonna talk to my friend now”.
sometimes you’ll get a normal person to talk to, but in a class of 300-600, that’s gonna be like 3% of people.

13slm07,Reflection from a jaded senior (gatekeeping culture at UW),"because every facet of UW is competitive (major admissions, internships, jobs), most students gatekeep their resources and misrepresent their stats. I’ve often seen fellow students and even friends gatekeep their network, internships, resources. As a result, it’s extremely hard for someone without network to even know where to begin looking for internships and get their foot in the door. I especially feel this as a first gen immigrant, as my parents can only nod and smile when I tell them about school or my internship. As much as people don’t want to believe it or laugh at it, but privilege also comes from having well connected parents (or even parents who know about how the American society works). This is where I sound cynical, but it really is true when people joke that someone can make a call to their dad or their dads friend and get an internship. I saw a video where there is soft nepotism (or something along those lines), where young people benefit from having parents in the same industry as them. I see my peers having their hands held through the recruiting process because they have parents in that industry. 

looking back, I want to stress the importance of network to incoming students. resources are distributed widely in professional RSOs and frats/sororities (which also require quite competitive applications but that’s another can of worms) but tightly restricted within those social circles, so make sure you are leveraging these networks.

edit: this post exists to reflect on my experiences and offer a word of advice to younger students. yes, this was my dream school, but because of that I came in with rose tinted glass thinking that as long as I do well (get into a good major, get good grades, get into good clubs) I will be recognized by the real world and be rewarded with a good job. However, I was unaware of the fact that networking is such an important factor in addition to doing well academically, and sometimes even trumps academic achievement. For those that have had similar experiences, I feel seen and I am glad we can all recognize the bigger issue. Yet I want to make it clear that I am not looking for sympathy, but to offer perspectives that I wish someone would have told me coming into college. I write this post partially to also let younger students know that academic achievement isn’t all and it’s better to start building connections, especially if they didn’t realize that network is important or what networking even is (as I was when I started college). 

Secondly, I admit that yes, I perhaps could’ve done better and shot for the stars. I am not giving myself any excuses, as many in the comments think I am doing. This isn’t a pity party, and I am not blaming other hardworking people for “taking things away from me”. My criticism is on the system where some people who have low, no experience, etc, can get a job because their parents have connection.

Lastly, some comments seem to rely on confirmation bias when evaluating the information in this post. More dangerously, making assumptions in the name of “tough love”. Just because I shed light on some less-than-peachy aspects of uw does not mean I have no connections or relationships. I have a job, friends, and I am full of hope. I am simply recognizing the fact that to get here, it took me a lot of extra work.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/13slm07/reflection_from_a_jaded_senior_gatekeeping/,36,269

epu304,Daily Review: Mediterranean Bowl at Center Fable 43.8dB,"Dear HFS,

Sorry for my absence in feedback. I tried to return the day before yesterday, and have attached the previous texts below.

Today I was euphoric when I saw the beef chili on the menu, kind of Norman victory of 1066 happy. The beef chili is quite possibly the best HFS meal I've had this week. In fact it was out of stock, the best HFS meal I've had this week was in my dreams: my humble feedback would to please give me decent food so that the best meal I've had from you is not in fact fictitious.

Instead I resorted to the Mediterranean Bowl: one of my favourites. I choose to add the beef, I'm not an ethical man. The beef was good, the bowl had a lot of food which was warm: more than I normally get both in heat and quality. I reiterate my previous points: it's way too expensive.

Also what's up with the lack of lids on catering troughs. You know, the trays food is kept in the weird warm fridges, that have cling film on. Why the flip, don't they have lids? Would lids not be more economical, environmental, and utilitarianism. Or is this some kind of aesthetic that's been lost on me? Is there actually a HFS Shitsthetic that I'm too uncultured to get?

pitysl,Advice to my younger freshman self...,"...from future you, who's been on campus for less than 2 quarters

1. Please read up what panic attacks and anxiety looks like. Cause when you took only half an edible and freaked out, you could've saved money by not going to the hospital. General rule of thumb, don't do anything new drug wise by yourself 

2. I don't care how cute it was when your first date with that junior was watching ATLA, trust him when he says he doesn't want a relationship. You're only hurting by staying and he is definitely not changing for you lol

3. Make multiple friend groups. Not just that group of people on your floor who gush about Superbad. Because trust me if (actually when) that group falls apart you're going to feel like the whole world is ending. Make friends everywhere and you're going to be just fine

4. That best friend 3,000 miles away from you? Not worth staying in your room convincing her to video call when friends at your door are holding snacks and ice cream because they wanted to support you during that friend breakup. Sometimes you outgrow people from your past and that's ok. It just means you're getting closer to being the person you're meant to be 

5. Don't walk alone at night on the Ave and Greek Row. If that boy cared about you, he would've cared about your safety

6. Flick the bean in the morning. Don't care how horny you are because 2 seconds away from finishing you're going to accidently make eye contact with your roommate who also thought you were sleeping...

7. 4am at ode with friends and strangers is going to make you happier than that one frat party 

8. Stop taking school so serious and get out of your room. Trust yourself that the after class revision was enough 

9. Water and center table's scrambled eggs the next morning. Your keys are in the fridge btw

10. Ice in that drink! Don't grind on the guy dressed up as harry potter! Go with three friends if you anticipate going home with some other girl!

10. Actually no take your studies seriously. After that first midterm, midterm season doesn't stop until 2 weeks before the end of quarter. Get back on that smh

11. Just know no matter what you did your best. You aren't perfect and no one is. Even that girl who seems to have everything (4.0 in CSE, a bf, perfect outfits, perfect body, etc.) Focus on doing YOUR best.

12. Stop taking everything so goddamn personal. You aren't the moon kissing the night sky. You have to sing Under the Sea with all your heart. You have to shovel Cheerios 2 mins before your 8:30 because you know you aren't going to function later. You have to pause for a minute and just admire those corgis. You have to stop spending hours after a test figuring out your grade and then your back up major. You've got to stop trying to make your neighbors like you. Fuck it kid. You've got to love yourself.

dwy9gw,My First Time Getting to an Exam Late...,"Hello, I'm a fellow sophomore taking Biol 180. Today, we had our third exam this quarter. The first two, I was there, squared, and I was prepared (but still didn't do that well). Anyways, I woke up today to my roommate asking when my exam was. 

""2:30,"" I replied. So I went to my Marine Bio class at 9:30 then used the time after to study for the Bio exam. In my mind, I still thought it was 2:30... But at exactly 1:35, I checked my phone to see my calendar for the quarter, which was the lock screen... and then... my heart dropped. My exam was at 1:30. I thought I might as well drop and take it again next quarter. But then I didn't give up... I grabbed my wallet, keys, and backpack and DASHED towards the door, PRESSED the elevator button... and waited like Thanos. I got in there, PRESSED floor 3, got out, RAN out the door, RAN through the Quad and then stopped to walk because I'm not athletic, then RAN again. Got to the front, my TA and John Parks directed me towards the back and proceeded to hand me the Exam... I wrote like a MAD MAN, like I'd never written before, wrote like Stephen King if he took Adderall. I will never forget this experience. Now I know what people are saying about PTSD after college for being late to exams. But one thing Dawgs... in the words of JOHN CENA... NEVER GIVE UP!

si6lsl,District Market out of Red Bulls,"I started college a devoted connoisseur of tea. A caffeine boost for me meant going crazy with some Earl Grey instead of my usual green tea. But soon the stress of weed-out classes and part time work at a fast food restaurant piled on to me. Simply put, I was exhausted. Around early November I was finally lured across the border into coffee consumption like a waterfront seagull is baited by an Ivar's french fry. This was my gateway drug. What started as one cup before my Math 125 lecture soon became three per day. Then four. Then five. As I integrated my way into finals season, I once again found myself drudging my way through the day in a cloudy stupor of apathy and mental exhaustion. I needed something new. 

With over $500 still left on my dining account, I stumbled into the District Market one Saturday morning looking for something absurd to buy in bulk. I considered potatoes and condoms, but soon realized both would sit around unused on the floor of my dorm, a stark reminder of my shortcomings this quarter. But then I saw them. Shiny metal cylinders, glistening erotically under the florescent lighting of the DM - their red, white and blue logo filling me with a patriotic romanticism I hadn't felt since Jay Inslee secured his third term as governor. I needed them. I needed them all.

Frantically filling a basket with as many as I could carry, I paraded my Red Bull bounty to the cashier with a new-found optimism. I was going to make it through the quarter.

As finals came and went, I jittered and twitched through my days with ease. While occasionally the DM would run out of my fix, I had a large enough stockpile under my bed to give me an illusion of sustainability. Simply put, I thought I was invincible. And I got complacent. Over the last few weeks, I decided to dip into my surplus, put off a restock until after midterms. Two days ago I found myself with only 10 Bulls to my name. I quickly marched over to the District Market for a resupply mission. Upon entering, my stomach folded itself into a klein bottle. The entire shelf was empty. 

In desperation, I returned yesterday. Nothing. And again this morning. Nothing. I sit here now sipping my very last Red Bull and typing this short rant out of desperation. But also as a warning to my fellow Huskies. Please help.",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/si6lsl/district_market_out_of_red_bulls/,24,252

These endorsements were grounded in general opinions and attitudes. 

Is this really worth our time to gripe about, this circle jerk of apologies? Slippery slope my boundless boys.

nb29b8,Get Ben Wiggins a Permanent Position at the Dept. of Biology,"Hi Guys,

I'm a graduating senior here at the UW graduating from Biochemistry. Some of you may know or have taken intro biology from Ben Wiggins. If you have you have seen how amazing this man is at teaching and the positive impact he leaves on freshmen every year. This quarter is unfortunately his last quarter. It has come to my attention that Ben is not a professor here and is hired as ""staff that teaches"". This means Ben works as administrative staff and only fills teaching positions when there are not enough people to teach. Unfortunately the Bio department does not plan to give him a full professor position to him and therefore he is not guaranteed for any new instructing opportunities. He has told me that this quarter is his last quarter teaching. Ben is the only instructor I have had the pleasure of learning from who actively incorporates the issues of equity in life, science, and stem into his lectures. He makes everyone feel welcome and he inspires students to become scientists.

 I am asking that if you find you care about this, that you please send a letter to the chair of biology and the associate chair of biology letting them know of your feelings. Additionally, you can make an impact by just giving him the rate my professor you've been meaning to but forgot about. STEM needs work to be better for it's students and accessible to everyone and if we lose Ben we will be losing one of our best workers here at UW.

Emails are: Chair of Biology David Perkel: [perkel@uw.edu](mailto:perkel@uw.edu)

Associate Chair of Undergraduate Biology Jennifer Ruesink: [ruesink@uw.edu](mailto:ruesink@uw.edu)

Edit: Ben himself told me this information and when I asked how to help this is what he told me. He may be teaching this summer I'm not sure perhaps he meant this is his last year. Yes he is in administration like I said, staff that teaches. However, he will be leaving teaching and looking elsewhere because there are no open positions. The point is that Ben would teach as his sole job if he could be he is not being given that position.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/nb29b8/get_ben_wiggins_a_permanent_position_at_the_dept/,16,249

3. Probably not! Unless you murdered someone or didn’t actually graduate highschool or something, and if that’s the case, you have a bigger problem on your hands!

178jkym,A suggestion to people considering UW (and any other schools with a city campus),"Do not be surprised when the city is a city!!!

The vast majority of safety-related posts on this sub boil down to “why is the city like a city, don’t they know STUDENTS live here?” or “how can I go to school in the city without confronting anything that is different from suburbia?” and I have to say, it’s really goofy. I understand that safety is important, but next to none of the questions asked need to be answered with any more nuance than “carry mace and be aware of your surroundings.” I’m not saying you can’t feel unsafe, but college is all about growing up and learning about the world, which often includes encountering things that aren’t comfortable or familiar, and posting asking if you’re gonna get murdered on the ave past 8pm or something like that is not going to help you in the long run. There are countless schools in small cozy college towns that are equally, if not more, academically rigorous than UW. With all those options out there, going to a school in the city is very much a choice, and it’s important to recognize a major city is a major city. You’ll be hard pressed to find one in the United States that doesn’t have the qualities that make people feel unsafe.

I know some people always have beef with this sort of take, but regardless on your opinion of how a city should be governed/policed/whatever, the current state of our city and all other major cities in the United States is reality. Carry your mace, keep an eye on your surroundings, and if you’re someone more vulnerable for whatever reason, try and have a buddy with you if you’re out late at night. If you want to challenge yourself, maybe even make eye contact with a homeless person and give them a nod instead of pretending they don’t exist; contrary to popular belief, most of them will not cannibalize you on the spot if you do so!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/178jkym/a_suggestion_to_people_considering_uw_and_any/,27,246
qkwas4,PSA: You should know what violates FERPA rules,"I recently took a midterm where they required us to write our name and student ID number on every page. ""Ok, if something gets separated, this makes sense as there will be no question about whose paper it is,"" I was thinking as I was starting my midterm.   
When we get them back a few days later, our exams were ripped into multiple sections and **left out in piles for the entire class to go through.** The next section walked in after our class and started going through the piles, too. **Our names in conjunction with our grades and student ID numbers (both of which are by definition educational records and therefore protected) were out and available for anyone to see.**   


You guys, ***this is a blatant violation of FERPA****.* Our grades are personal educational records. If I choose to flip through an exam with all my grades on it in view of everyone, that's my choice. If I want to keep my grades hidden and only look at them in a locked, windowless closet, that's my choice too. Having grades in a pile with identifiable information attached to them *takes away this right that we have as students*.   


[Here](http://courses.washington.edu/registr/FERPA_Faculty_Staff/FERPA_Handout.pdf) is a PDF that outlines some of this. It was written in 2011 but have FERPA requirements loosened since then? No. They haven't. 

[This link](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/ferpa/) says that ""**Public posting** of grades either by the student’s name, student number, or social security number without the student’s written permission is a violation of FERPA.""

WSU has a statement in [this link](http://ferpa.em.wsu.edu/faqs/) that directly states that handing back graded work like this is a violation. (Under Staff and 'How should I return graded work?' there is a statement that says, ""Distributing graded work in a way that exposes the student’s identity or leaving personally identifiable graded papers unattended is no different from posting grade publicly."")

  
**IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED IN ONE OF YOUR CLASSES:**   
Please follow [this link](https://privacy.uw.edu/report/), and report it! We have rights as students, and being able to call out our university for violating FERPA is one of them. We also have a right to report UW *directly to the Department of Education.* [This](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=478-140-080) shows that right, as well as [this one](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/). 

[This page](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/) (same link as the immediate last one) has a FERPA training for students (it's a 10 minute video and a short quiz) if you want more information.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/qkwas4/psa_you_should_know_what_violates_ferpa_rules/,60,247

The pandemic has made this loss all the more difficult, and it would be greatly appreciated if you could lend your support if you're able.

The shirts being sold for this fundraiser were made in solidarity of victims of suicide, including those struggling or those that have attempted. All money raised from this will be given to Casey's family to help pay for the costs of Casey's funeral. You can purchase the shirts [here](https://stores.kotisdesign.com/j4l9oi3yv3/products).

1bni061,I went to and reviewed all the local Boba options,"The amount of Boba in the University District is absurd. No drug stores on the ave, frozen yogurt is gone, but over 20 places where you can get boba. My natural inquiry was ""Why do these all exist? Are there any significant differences between them?"" Over the years I've tried a number of them, but over the last two quarters I've slowly been making an effort to try every single one and tracked how I thought about them in a spreadsheet :P

My strategy was to order each place's black milk tea with tapioca as a default baseline. This doesn't cover other types of tea like green tea, fruit tea, or any unique flavors that might make a place stand out, so if any of you have specific recommendations for these please let me know! I may expand/adjust my spreadsheet over time as I try more from these places, hence why I'm sending a link instead of a screenshot.

Tastes will be subjective and you may not agree with my reviews, and I am not claiming to be a boba expert by any means. This was just more of a fun project and was meant to help determine what places I would recommend to others. I'm open to suggestions and also encourage anyone else to share their thoughts!

How've you been?

I got the pasta special, I wouldn't describe it as special nor pasta. I can only assume you'd intended to make a Bolognese, accidentally snorted an entire jar of paprika: and found nowhere else to spew.

For $7.49 instead of buying overcooked pasta with a sauce that could only be described as disappointing even if I had got it from a discount dented tin can, I could have walked to Dominos. Got a pizza, and have enough change to buy an overpriced bowl of cereal tomorrow morning after undoubtedly having a horrid case of the shits.

I could have got the potato curry again. However I decided to take one for the team, and provide a variety in my feedback for y'all. I would love it if I was able to provide a quality range of feedback by eating cheap decent meals, like the tolerable potato curry yesterday.

For reference a medium sized truck makes 80.3dB. After finishing my meal I said ""HFS is a scam"" at 80.3db.

Love you lots,

Keep up the scam,

You guys worked really hard too, and I hope some of you can realize that. You’re all really smart, and you earned your spot here.

iz5ndv,KiwiLink - a brand new UW study buddy finder app - free on iOS and Android - made BY UW students FOR UW students - great new way to make friends in a time of quarantine,"If you’re anything like me, you suck at finding study buddies and you STRUGGLE with making meaningful connections at the University of Washington lemao. Now that COVID19 is a thing, antisocial-academia is even MORE of a problem, as we find ourselves indefinitely isolated lol. We are BOUNDED BOIZ.

Along with around 15 other engineers and designers, I decided to tackle this issue of antisocial-academia this summer. After months of grinding, I’m proud to announce that our work has finally resulted in some pay-off (lol).

Today, I’m excited to introduce KiwiLink - the ultimate UW study buddy finder app! Download it for free on iOS and Android today. 

KiwiLink is super easy to use. Create an account, select your classes and majors, and BOOM! Our special algorithm will automatically introduce you to relevant study buddies in the “For You” page. Swipe right to add these people as KiwiLink friends, and then you can chat with them and make study groups with them! And who knows… Perhaps you’ll find a special someone who’s MORE than just a study buddy xd

But yuh. If you want to find some new UW friends to study with or chat with (or more), download KiwiLink today! It’s free and it’s available on both iOS and Android. We’ve been tirelessly working on this project for a couple of months, so we really hope that people make good use of our app.

h8kza0,To everyone who was skipped at graduation,"I'm so fucking proud of you!!!!!!!

Despite covid, despite online classes, despite social ills impacting us right now, you've made a remarkable accomplishment despite 4 years of anxieties, frustrations, and challenges.

However you've also had 4 years of hopefully good memories, laughs, and accomplishments. Nothing will ever change the fact that you've accomplished so much!

To those who were omitted and feel alone...

You're not alone. I was the only person from my former high school (16 of us were graduating) who was mentioned at graduation this year, and even then, not where I was supposed to be. 

I was College of Arts and Sciences. For some reason, I was put with the random stragglers after the College of Social Work. I know that an online graduation is tough, but the 6 minutes where I felt embarrassed and angry that my name wasn't mentioned, at least when I still thought I was omitted? I can only imagine how everyone else feels, who weren't even misplaced as much as they were omitted. 

If we're still being told to have a weak cop out by joining the C/O '21, I'd hope that the Office of Ceremonies/UW at least try to do something to compensate. For many of us, this was one of the most important events of our lives thus far, and for others, a moment of pride. Through UW's and their contractor's gross incompetence, many people have felt hurt in times already tough.

To any graduates now, who were missed, I see you, and I'm so proud of you all for your achievements. Please, take your objective accomplishment, and continue to work for yourself and in making this world a better place.

I'm genuinely so proud of you all, and whilst employment, and life in general are far from ideal right now, tough times breed tough people, and tough people breed good times. As the cycle of life continues, know that as we continue, in our individual and societal pursuits, that we can and will build a future regardless of this one day, and this one year.

Congratulations to the Class of 2020! I wish you all the best.

P.S. In the event that the Office of Ceremonies/UW does nothing to compensate and celebrate those missed, is there something that we as students, and now alumni, can do to make things feel better?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/h8kza0/to_everyone_who_was_skipped_at_graduation/,8,239

You guys are amazing for keeping your composure. I'm a UWT student in the IT major and I hope to have you guys again.



Professor Goda, the head of the major, caught a cheater during our jeopardy quiz. The mood completely changed from there on but he still was willing to give the class extra credit for the top 5 groups. You genuinely made waking up at 8:45 enjoyable. You interacted with your class like it was a late night discord call with the homies. I don't think I've laughed this much in class ever. (It was also adorable that your wife would come talk to you during our breaks)

Professor Costarella (Chuck), I fully want to email you my final project. I'm willing to finish this. Time management sucked this quarter since MW classes were screwed out of 3 sessions this quarter.

grpg1t,Korean restaurant ranking in U-district from poor Korean international student,"&#x200B;

Why Korean food so expensive around U district? 

Here's ranking

3: Korean Tofu House

\- This place is alright, recently remodeled. but sometimes they piss me off that they're kind of half-assing the banchan(side dishes) and sometimes cooks seem like they never had Korean food before. It's on and off on some days. Very Americanized Korean food though and ramen for 8 dollars? go to h mart across the street and buy yourself 10 ramens. 

2: Cafe on the ave

\- Known as a cafe but surprisingly good Korean food. Affordable and a lot of food.

1: The Alley

\- If you don't know what 'ajumma' hospitality is. You'll learn if you go to this place. I think this place is the closest thing to restaurant-grade food in Korea. 

&#x200B;

Honorable mentions:

Green House

That nightclub (buffet is not bad)

Ninja sushi queen backflip 360 quick scope

&#x200B;

Places that are way overpriced because they're selling the 'experience'(almost Portage bay of Korean food) imo:

1afn6sz,The “what are my chances” posts are getting out of hand,"I’ve been browsing this subreddit occasionally and every time I come on here, it seems that at least 1/3rd of the posts are people asking about their admissions chances. Most university subreddits don’t allow posts like this, and instead make megathreads for admissions questions for obvious reasons. There’s also other subreddits like r/chanceme that are completely devoted to these kinds of questions.

I completely understand just wanting to feel a little certainty, and I remember how anxious waiting for a decision can be. But the truth is that none of us are able to read your GPA and SAT off a reddit post and then accurately tell you whether you’ll be admitted or not. The admissions criteria is holistic and often pretty unclear, and even if you think you have no shot, it can’t hurt to apply and see.

If the moderators are at all active here, they should take some steps to stop the influx of these posts.",Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1afn6sz/the_what_are_my_chances_posts_are_getting_out_of/,9,233

qyh9sm,PSA for those living in campus housing,"Last year I was living in the dorms in Lander, I had stayed here for both thanksgiving and Christmas because of covid. On Christmas Day last year, while I was in my room just on my phone being quiet whatever assumed vacant, got my doorknob rattled on and someone trying to get into my room. My friend and I were obviously pissing our pants at this points, I live in a single, and we weren’t going to confront this person head on but I did go to the door and look at the peephole. I saw a person turned back to me at the door across doing the same thing and did it to numerous other doors, I immediately called uwpd but the person was gone already by the time they got there. I lived on 4th floor at the time and my friend who lived on 7th returned to their room to check if everything was okay to see their door wide open, nothing was taken because there was no cash or anything, there was even a really expensive gaming laptop of the friends roommate in there untouched so I don’t think people will necessarily take items as much as they are looking for cash, doesn’t mean someone won’t though. So, if you are leaving for the holidays either thanksgiving or Christmas, be very aware and lock your door every time you are in and out of your room, excellent to practice in general, I know the doors lock on their own when you shut them. But my guess is the person had a card or something to wedge in between the door to open it, if your door is locked you have nothing to worry about. Don’t let the residential grinch steal your stuff stay safe out there 🙏",PSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/qyh9sm/psa_for_those_living_in_campus_housing/,2,231

13l70r8,Open Letter To Boba Up Employees,"I saw a poster on Tuesday morning saying that BobaUp employers were stealing employee tips. This poster has since been taken down and the original poster didn't have anything on it about how to get in contact with people or if there was any organizing to combat this practice. I just wanted to let those employees know that under Washington State Law:

* Employers must pay all tips to employees.
* The employer may not take tips for company use, or to pay employee wages.
* “Tip crediting” isn’t allowed. Tips are **in addition to**, and not a part of, an employee’s state hourly minimum wage.

[https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges](https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges)

I know a lot of workers especially in the service industry worry that it is a losing battle when it comes to standing up for their labor violations, so I wanted to link some resources to ways that employees can enforce their rights:

1. You can get free legal council about your situation with the king county bar association. This will probably be low on the priority list, but they will get to you and it is FREE. I did this myself about a workplace violation and while I have to hire an attorney for the actual lawsuit, it is good to have free legal council to see if proceeding with legal action is a good idea (link to free legal assistance [https://www.kcba.org/?pg=Free-Legal-Assistance](https://www.kcba.org/?pg=Free-Legal-Assistance) )
2. Make sure to document as much as you can in writing. When you have a spoken conversation with your employer saying this stuff about your wages, email them a followup confirming what had been discussed in the meeting so you have a paper trail. Often recording this is enough to scare them straight
3. Talk to your coworkers about your situation and see if you can form a united front. Employers talk a lot about how your labor is replaceable, but honestly it is costly to fire a bunch of people legally, let alone illegally, and then hire a bunch of new inexperienced people. There are ways that you can organize in order to collectively bargain for good treatment. Just because a company is a small business that does not mean that you should accept unethical and illegal treatment from your employer.",PSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/13l70r8/open_letter_to_boba_up_employees/,23,227
xdrwqg,I hate HFS and they are an embarrassment to this university.,"I drive all the way to the UW to move into my dorm. My email from HFS says Lander Desk closes at 10 PM through this week and I am good to grab my keys from them at anytime until the school year starts. Google Maps also says they close at 10 PM. The HFS website even says they close at 9 PM. I arrive at 7:40 PM. I *should* have plenty of time. I walk in. The gate around Lander Desk is closed. But the desk is still fully staffed with 4-5 people working about. I ask them if they can help me. They say ""No, they are closing at 7 PM for this week.""

I call the RA on call. They say that they can't help me because they can't verify my identity, but I should be able to go to Lander Desk. I tell them the desk is closed. The RA says they will pull some strings and call me back in 5 minutes. 20 minutes goes by. No call. I decided to go home. I get home 40 minutes later. I finally get a call back from them. I hate HFS

n0rlj3,[Opinionated Overview] The whole beef between the ASUW and The Daily is so incredibly messed up and it makes me so angry.,"**UPDATE:** I have posted a follow-up thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1e3kz/a_followup_on_my_opinionated_overview_and_how_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that includes detailed instructions on submitting complaints and a petition to resolve problems surrounding the sending of the email.

[The cartoon in question](https://preview.redd.it/yvd4q5t2ozv61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90dfd1f3c40f2ead992a6a457b65913ace3b830)

So I, like many of you received an email from ASUW (from which I am not subscribed to any newsletter) about racist imagery targeting certain UW students. My first thought was that it was probably some right-wing cartoonist who posted a problematic opinion piece that crossed the line, but I couldn't find it because it seemed to have already been removed. You can see it above here. The general consensus amongst students who have problems with this is essentially that this cartoon compares the majority BIPOC candidates to animals (along with a food truck and public art piece).

Before I move on and explain why I don't think this is a comparison or racist at all, let me give you the context for the cartoon that the mass-sent email left out. The Daily is a student-run newspaper that always posts their candidate endorsements for the ASUW elections, which is UW's student government. This year however, likely due to Covid-19 and people not being as involved and on-campus, the tickets for the major races stand completely uncontested with one unofficial opposition ticket. The Daily this year decided to not endorse any of the candidates, specifically stating that ""This year, The Daily has decided not to endorse any of the candidates,  all of whom are qualified for their respective positions but, based on  their performance, are clearly not prepared."" I *highly* encourage you to read the full endorsement article, which can found [here](https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html). You will find that while the writers have both positive and negative opinions on each candidate, they still choose not to endorse any.

Now here is where the cartoon comes in: since all of the elections are uncontested, the article pokes fun at this fact by suggesting write-in candidates consisting of iconic UW imagery. Any student who has been on campus and many who have not had the chance will be able to recognize these ""candidates"" as staples of the UW's campus culture and jokes pertaining to them have been common for as long as they have existed. Now, the medicinal herb garden monkey seems to be the animal people are most upset about, and it does not help that it is one of the more niche UW icons. If you are unaware of the monkey, you can read about it's history and see pictures of it [here](https://magazine.washington.edu/monkey-business-the-story-of-the-uw-medicinal-herb-garden-and-its-guardians). Considering all of this information and context, I am hard-pressing in seeing the angle that many critics are presenting that the candidates are being ""compared"" in any way to these animals which only make up a portion of the suggestions.

Ultimately, The Daily removed this cartoon from their publication and issued an open-letter apology to the ASUW. If this is where the controversy ended, I would move on and not make this post but I am sure most of you reading this are aware of the email that was just sent to all UW students from the ASUW.

Today, the ASUW president issued an email to all UW students under the subject ""ASUW Response to the 04/26 Post from The Daily"" which claimed, without any context provided, that The Daily had published ""racist imagery from The Daily surrounding the current ASUW elections"". I, like many of you, went to the subreddit and my friends in both The Daily staff and the ASUW to see what had happened and after which found a cartoon that was blown significantly out of proportion by the ASUW.

I am extremely disappointed that the ASUW leadership would abuse their power to email every UW student, regardless of subscription status, to paint The Daily as racist out of nowhere to the entire student body over a few student's perception of one cartoon from one artist. The Daily is a student-run organization that staffs many POC's and has always supported progressive student movements, protests, and actions. It is completely unfair for them to have someone with the power to email every student claim that they published racist imagery after the cartoon was removed and people can't even see the what was posted anymore. How is The Daily even supposed to defend themselves if the narrative can be so easily controlled by one side? The calls for The Daily to ""do better"" than the apology by donating from their already limited budget to things like mutual aid is outrageous and completely unnecessary. I saw one student say that ""y'all gotta pay reparations anyway"" so the POC staff for The Daily better open up their wallets, I guess.

There needs to be consequences for whoever approved this abusive and manipulative email to be sent to the entire student body like this. All it has done is put the safety of The Daily staff in jeopardy and given fuel for right-wing pundits to use to indoctrinate even more people who have an irrational fear of cancel culture. However, I for one do not want to wait for action to be taken and call for people to write in ""Dubs I"" for every position to show that we are not okay with this kind of behavior from those who are supposed to protect and lift up our student organizations who fight for just causes, especially the press which highlights many civil rights and social justice issues facing the students in our school.

&#x200B;

TLDR: The ASUW president sent an email to every UW student out of nowhere and with no context claiming that The Daily is racist over a cartoon that was no longer publicly available, unfairly controlling the narrative of the situation and putting the safety of the publicly listed staff of The Daily in jeopardy.

ffajy9,DO NOT come to UW if you want to do CS but are not DA,"**PSA: If you are dead set on studying Computer Science at UW and not directly admitted to the major, DO NOT COME HERE.**

Since it’s UW admission season, and many soon-to-be college freshmen are looking to study Computer Science (CS), I’d like to give some of my thoughts about why anybody who isn’t a direct admit (DA) and is looking to study CS should steer clear of coming to UW.

First of all, if you were admitted to UW Computer Science as a Direct Admit freshman, congratulations! I highly highly highly recommend coming here to study because UW CS is pretty much cream of the crop, and you’ll have a great time here.

This post is meant for everyone who applied to CS and was admitted to UW as a pre-sciences student, or applied to Computer Engineering and was admitted as a Direct to College (DTC) of Engineering student.

As a 3x CSE reject, I will try to explain this to the best of my ability. If there’s anything that can be improved, let me know in the comments and I’ll edit it.

In an effort to accommodate the large demand for CS and to avoid having students go to UW for a few years only to not get into CS, the Paul Allen school moved to a mainly DA system in 2019. This means that almost all people studying computer science at UW will be DA freshmen from now on. So if the Computer Science program admissions were competitive before for current UW students, it’s hell now. [Even the UW website tells you to go to a different school.](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm)

Here’s some attitudes I had as a CS-hopeful freshman that got BTFO’d after being in UW for a year and a half (I’m a sophomore now).

**“Oh, I’ll work hard and I’ll get in for sure!”**

And so will everyone else. I’m sure you’ve all been getting 3.9 GPA/36 ACT/1600 SAT, and a ton of 5s on AP tests with no problem in high school, and expect to keep getting top scores in college. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN IN COLLEGE! You are now in a school where everyone else is as smart as you. Your study habits that got you an A in high school will land you a 2.6 in Physics 121. Even if you do somehow land a 4.0 GPA, it STILL might not be enough to get into CS. Searching this subreddit will show you some people with ridiculously good grades and extracurriculars who still got rejected from CS.

Your whole grade is determined by 2 or 3 exams, because homework counts for shit. If you want to get into CS, you need to get a near perfect score on every single exam. The margin for error is about one or two problems on every test, meaning if you fuck up big time on one problem on one exam, especially in CSE 143, it’s over. I fucked up on a recursion problem and a stacks and queues problem on my CSE 143 midterm and it was enough to bury my CSE admission chances into the ground.

Your grades are also highly dependent on luck. Just take this quarter, for example. One of my friends got below average on the CSE 143 midterm and wanted to use the final to pull up his grade. It just so happens that the entire school has now shut down due to coronavirus and the CSE 143 final is cancelled, so he’s fucked. Professors and TAs also grade differently and have different teaching materials. This is a lot of variability when every single point on every single assignment and test matters when you’re trying to get into CS.

**For DTC admits:**

This section is for all of you freshmen who applied for Computer Engineering (or any other engineering major) and got ""Engineering Undeclared"" status. If you got Pre-Engineering, you are not in the College of Engineering and this section doesn't apply to you.

Now, you College of Engineering admits might think, “oh, I got DTC, I’m set lol” THIS IS NOT THE CASE. If getting into CS through the regular pathway is at a 10/10 difficulty, getting into CE through DTC is like 9/10 difficulty. It’s possible if you get near perfect scores on everything and have an outstanding application, but I’ve known multiple people who’ve had a 3.8 GPA with a 3.5+ CSE 143 grade get rejected from Computer Engineering [One look at these DTC admission statistics](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement/data) should tell you that literally everyone else also thought they could get into Computer Engineering through DTC and that it’s by far the most competitive engineering major. This year, I’ve talked to countless people who applied to just Computer Engineering in the first application cycle and ended up in Electrical Engineering this second application cycle. [Even the College of Engineering website says that DTC isn’t a good fit for Computer Engineering or bust people.](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/directtocollege/faq) When you apply for a major through DTC (called “[placement](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement)”), you pick 6 majors (you can pick less, but then you’re not guaranteed a major) by the order in which you want to study them and then the admissions officers pretty much pick your major for you out of that list. You’re guaranteed at least your last pick. If you don’t accept what they give you, they will KICK YOU OUT of the College of Engineering. They’ll try to tell you in your E-FIG that eNgInEeRiNg iS InTeRdIsCiPlInArY, but the similarities between Computer Engineering and Environmental Engineering are laughable. If you get into DTC and you’re going for Computer Engineering, get ready to select Electrical Engineering as your backup major.

**“Oh, I can get into a backup major that is pretty much just like CS!”**

[Here’s an overview of some CS-related majors.](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/overview/related-majors)

I’ll go over four CSE backup majors here.

**Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences (ACMS):**

If CS is a 10/10 difficulty to get admitted to normally, then ACMS is like a 9/10. It’s also super fucking difficult, because you will have to study a ton of math that CS majors won’t have to. This is a really good option if you’re into data science, machine learning, and other applications of mathematical computing but it’s a small department and almost as hard as CS to get into.

**Electrical Engineering (EE):**

EE is not very hard to get into if you’re DTC (like a 3.0 GPA will be good enough if your application is strong), but ironically it’s probably a harder major to study because of all the extra math and physics. EE is not the best major to study if you’re only interested in becoming a software engineer. Most EE concentrations don’t have much in common with CS curriculum, and you’ll be spending most of your time building circuits and studying continuous math rather than looking at discrete mathematics and data structures. The Embedded Systems track is probably the closest you can get to studying Computer Engineering as an EE student; however, I’ve heard that it’s a niche field within CSE.

**Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE):**

HCDE pretty much only accepts DTC students now. [They had a 13% admit rate this last cycle.](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/bs/admissions-faq)

HCDE is a great major, but it focuses almost solely on user design. It is a program for people looking to become UX/UI designers, not for computer scientists. Some front-end development skills are covered, but don’t expect any algorithms or computing theory or anything that will really prepare you for a full stack development or software engineering job from this major.

**Informatics:**

IMO, Informatics is the best backup for aspiring software developers. You won’t learn much theory but you’ll learn a lot of full stack development skills, design skills, cybersecurity skills, and more, depending on what track you decide to study. Admissions are actually holistic and don't focus on grades heavily, so even if you get a 3.0 in CSE 143 you’ll still have a good chance. However, every single CSE reject is also applying for Informatics and it is insanely competitive. I took Info 200 this quarter and my professor repeatedly stated that they turn down many qualified applicants each cycle just because there is not enough space to accommodate everyone.

**Other Backup Major Advice:**

There are some other majors like Geographic Information Systems but at that point you should think about if you really want to study Geography or if it’s best to just cut your losses and transfer to UW Bothell.

If you’re thinking about just loading up on CSE non-major classes, while being in another major, it might be better just to go to another school. The non-major courses vary in quality since they are not the courses CSE focuses its time and effort on (that’s reserved for the major courses). CSE 373 is good, but I’ve heard the rest of the non-major CSE classes can be very variable in quality.

If you plan to pursue a backup major, make sure you’re actually interested in the backup major. After all, you’ll be spending most of your time studying that major and not CSE courses.

**In conclusion**, it is not worth the time and effort to pour 2 years of your life into polishing every single line of code to perfection and fretting about every single lost point on every assignment/test at the cost of all other parts of your life just to be handed rejection after rejection from the CSE department. Don’t make the mistake I made. I was accepted to CS programs in multiple schools around the country, but I turned them all down to go to UW since it was my top choice. I have spent countless hours regretting going to UW and agonizing over what majors I could still apply for after CSE was no longer a realistic option. Thankfully, I was admitted to a major (see flair) I am interested in studying, but I know many people who are in a much worse place than I am. I hope this post gave a little insight for those of you who have been admitted to UW and are still deciding on what school to commit to.

**TL;DR: if you are dead set on studying CS, do not come to UW Seattle if you were not directly admitted to the major. It is virtually impossible to get admitted to CS and you would be much better off going to another school to study CS.**

It was a light touch and so stealthy that I wasn't even 100% sure he had done it intentionally, until I asked a girl next to me if he grabbed my ass and she said yes. He looked to be in his late teens to early 20s, over 6' tall, black (light brown skin), shoulder length dreadlocks, and a bit on the heavier side.

I called transit security and 911, and they both told me that this guy has done this to multiple women over the past several days at the U District station.

Still very exhausted from an emotional day of trying to figure out what to with my shrimp babies. 

The next task for me is to prevent this agony from happening to another shrimp parent—HFS needs to be more clear on the rules regarding what can go in a fish tank.

tbo3hn,2:30am harassed w/ taser by red square,"open note to the two assholes who buzzed a taser at me approx. 2:30 this morning: fuck you.

hopefully the intended audience sees this but if not, some context: i was walking myself from campus back to my room really late. walking up from drumheller, i saw a couple in front of me (other students, probably freshman or sophomores), walking in the same direction towards my dorm. i was at an awkward distance behind them, not super close, but close enough to consider speeding up to pass. the girl kept looking back at me weirdly and i thought she might be uncomfortable so i decided to pass them w/ a good amount of room between us. understandable, it was late at night, i didn’t want to make her paranoid walking behind them and i also was irritated at her looking back at me so much like holy shit seriously learn how to mind your business.

after i pass and am continuing to walk faster to create space, they start saying shit about having a taser, i guess as a warning? they said that they would use it on me if i came at them or something and started laughing like it was some sort of joke. then scared the shit out of me by buzzing it, which apparently they thought was funny too because they were joking around. i didn’t acknowledge them even as they continued to laugh at my expense, lowkey scared they would be stupid enough to actually attack me with the taser if i engaged.

keep in mind that nothing about me screams threatening: i’m a 19 year old girl, 5’1” and i was wearing sweatpants, a lanyard, no dark clothes and had my backpack on - literally peak tired college student attire. i understand being apprehensive at night but they turned a non-situation into borderline harassment.

anyways, fuck both of you. i was minding my own business and that was incredibly humiliating and scary. like middle school bully level shit. hope that you both fail your finals and have a terrible spring break fr. manifesting it 🙏🙏",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/tbo3hn/230am_harassed_w_taser_by_red_square/,32,511

v47zub,"So, HBO is Limiting Disability and General Access to Your Building","Hi everyone! I know we've all been very annoyed with how UW Photography (as a division of UW Marketing and Communications) and HBO have been affecting movement on campus this week. Including intervals as long as 10-15 minutes yesterday where the director refused to let students through sets including over wheelchair accessible ramps and doors WHILE yelling at students to take off their masks.

I am here to share some resources, emails, and advice to direct your anger over anything from being late for your finals to film crews parked in fire lanes and blocking access to wheelchair accessible entrances and pathways on campus.

First:
RECORD EVERYTHING. if you genuinely want to hold UW and HBO accountable for their glaring ADA errors here, take pictures and videos to document exactly what they're doing.

BE CONFRONTATIONAL but non-violent, they have no legal authority to prevent you from traveling anywhere on the campus of a university to which you pay tuition.

Now upload it.

Next:
EMAIL. Flood the inboxes or the following people for whatever they caused or can resolve.

Studio Manager (for UW Photography) Pamela Dore
pdore@uw.edu
According to multiple representatives from UW Marketing & Communications / UW Photography, Dore is the person responsible from providing access to and greenlighting activities of the production on campus.

HBO On-Set ADA Representative, Mark Freid
markafreid@gmail.com
This guy is supposed to work to ensure HBO remains ADA compliant.

Director / Campus Filming & University Photography, Alanya Cannon
alcan@uw.edu
Alanya is responsible on behalf of the university to ensure ADA and other issues do not impact students in and around the production.

filmoffice@seattle.gov
All film productions of this scale go through the Seattle Office of Film and Music to get permits, etc.
The DO NOT enable them to block accessible pathways or park in fire lanes.

These people all have phone numbers, too, so please use what you are comfortable with.

Finally:
Share this post. The more people who come here and find resources to share the issues they've encountered with the production, the louder we are, the quicker they fix it.

fqylrn,"Why We Still Have to Pay Full Price for Tuition, from a student who is on the Student Fees Committee: A COMPREHENSIVE EXPLANATION","It sucks... but there's not a whole lot we can do about it. Here's my understanding of the situation because people deserve more clarity than what admin is saying.

Before I begin, use these guides:

[Spring Quarter Overview](https://www.washington.edu/provost/springquarter/)

[Housing and Food Services](https://www.washington.edu/provost/springquarter/)

[Registration (Classes)](https://registrar.washington.edu/2020/03/26/spring-quarter-2020-covid-19-faqs/)

[Financial Aid](https://www.washington.edu/financialaid/2020/03/20/covid-19-faqs/)

They're going to answer \*almost\* any question you have and they are the starting point for my inferences.

I am a Senior on the Services and Activities Fee, we set the SAF, IMA, and FRF every year, not tuition or other fees but I can shed light on the process. This is grossly oversimplified.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit for added clarity, 3/29/2020 6pm**

Many of the tuition and fee items are determined at the state level a year ahead. The UW itself does not operate independently. As a state school, budgets for various sections of the university are presented to the Board of Regents, and some must be approved by the state legislature. Making any tuition change cannot happen just with the President, without legislative, or at least, board approval.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best way I can think to do this is go one by one on each item in your tuition bill.

# Operations Fee (Tuition)

**What it is:** This is what people think about when we say tuition. It gets divided up among the different colleges and departments based on enrollment. The money funds mostly faculty and some staff as well as educational costs. For In-State students, the State of WA picks up about 2/3 of this tab but out of state students and international students pay full price. This money also pays for all University operations like Ana Marie's salary and UW IT (who are very busy these days).  The UW gets a lot of money from donors, our endowment, and from athletics... BUT NONE OF IT PAYS FOR SCHOOL. All of that money pays for extra stuff like new buildings and scholarships.

**Why it won't go down:** All the money tuition goes towards still has to be paid out. (ex: faculty are on salaries). The only way it will go down is if someone else picks up the tab. The State of Washington could as could the Federal Government but that's about it.

# Building Fee (Tuition)

**What it is:** This pays for what the state and donors don't, but it keeps the lights on. Literally. It funds custodial staff and regular building maintenance, plus some other stuff.

**Why it won't go down:** The buildings may be used less but the custodians are working harder than ever. The labs can't shut off, nor can the servers, security systems, custodial offices and grounds keepers. There will be very little electricity savings in comparison so we'll get nothing back.

# [(Student) Technology Fee](https://uwstf.org/)  (STF)

**What it is:** This is a mandatory fee that Seattle Campus students voted to give ourselves and it funds all sorts of cool stuff like DawgPrints, Charging Stations, and even new cardio equipment at the IMA. It is administered by a committee of students who allocate funding and increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** The money has already been sent out to projects and programs that are helping students even though we're not there. Most notably the [Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/) [which gives out FREE laptops to students this quarter so they can still attend class remotely.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgPeMw-hL7w&t=0s)

# [Services and Activities Fee](https://depts.washington.edu/safcom/about.php) (SAF)

**What it is:** This is very similar to STF but it funds the operations of 17 different, student-facing units on the Seattle Campus. These include essential services like [Hall Health](http://depts.washington.edu/hhpccweb/clinics-services/primary-care/), [The Counseling Center](https://www.washington.edu/counseling/), and [The Food Pantry](https://www.washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry/). It also includes things that are closed like [the IMA](https://www.washington.edu/ima/) and the [HUB](https://hub.washington.edu/). Some units will save a little money on student wages this quarter but they will still pay lots to their professional staff. The money also funds [ASUW](http://www.asuw.org/), [GPSS](http://depts.washington.edu/gpss/) and [The Daily](http://www.dailyuw.com/) which are still very active and especially important right now. It is administered by a committee of students who allocate funding and increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** Because the funding is allocated annually and although some units will save money, others won't. The savings will just go towards next year's programs and or special online programming this quarter. Even if we could reduce it for one quarter (which would be hard because it's an annual allocation), we are bound by state law to keep fee increases under 4% annually so any decrease now screws over all future students because the units would be dramatically underfunded for a few years.

# IMA Bond Fee

**What it is:** This fee is used to pay off a 30-year loan issued to the Students by the UW Internal Loan Program (UW internal bank) which funded the IMA building renovation in 2004. Right now, the SAF Committee is planning on using this fee to fund another [30 year loan to remodel the IMA pool and locker room](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/7gigks/uw_recreation_wants_to_hear_from_you_about_a/). It is administered by the SAF Committee who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** This fee pays off a loan and unless the loan payments are deferred for the quarter, the money must still be collected. The UW board of Regents may be able to authorize a temporary hold on payments to eliminate the fee for this quarter, but I doubt that will happen.

# Facilities and Renovation Fee (FRF)

**What it is:** This fee is used to pay off a 30-year loan issued to the Students by the UW Internal Loan Program (UW internal bank) which funded the Hall Health, HUB, and ECC building renovations in 2012.  It is administered by the SAF Committee who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** This fee pays off a loan and unless the loan payments are deferred for the quarter, the money must still be collected. The UW board of Regents may be able to authorize a temporary hold on payments to eliminate the fee for this quarter, but I doubt that will happen.

# [U-PASS Fee](https://transportation.uw.edu/getting-here/transit/student-advisory-board)

**EDIT 4/6:** [U-PASS has been waived for the whole quarter. You will get a refund for if you already paid it. If transit services start charging again before the end of the quarter, students will be able to purchase U-PASS at the employee rate.](https://transportation.uw.edu/news/u-pass-update-spring-quarter)

**What it is:** This fee, which was voted on by students to give to ourselves, goes directly to local transit agencies so that UW students have almost unlimited access to transit in the region. The funds are allocated to each agency based on how many students used that service. (which is why you still have to tap your husky card instead of just showing the driver your card). Most students don't use all $88 of value they paid for per quarter, but almost every commuter student uses way more than that. In general we subsidize transit for those who need it most. It is administered by the U-PASS Advisory Board (made up of students) who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** IT MIGHT!!! Most transit agencies that U-PASS is apart of have suspended fares during the shutdown because ridership is very low and they don't want anyone going near the drivers. (You enter from the back door of buses). Because of this, even if a UW student were to travel by transit, they won't have to tap their card, and thus, the transit agency wouldn't get any money from the U-PASS pot. This means that we probably don't need to pay the fee for this quarter.

**EDIT 3/29 from** **A student who knows a lot about the U-PASS program budget**

>In addition to student fees, which make up most of the program, the U-PASS is paid for in part by money from the central budget office & money that is overflow from parking revenue.  
>  
>The money from the central budget office is equal to 10% of the program costs with the caveat that it is capped at 1.8 million dollars.  
>  
>The parking money, called Transit Demand Management, is supposed to make the U-PASS program whole. However, just like the money from the central budgeting office, it has a cap. (I believe the cap might still be in some negotiation, but right now, as far as I know, it is as follows: a maximum of 62% of TDM may be paid to the U-PASS program of total TDM parking revenue).  
>  
>Basically, with campus shut down, the U-PASS fee might be able to be put on pause, but it probably won’t generate any surplus or something if the fee doesn’t end up getting waived. And the random and arbitrary caps to the aid the program receives from the university will be reached  sometime in the next two years (according to estimates) so there will be some fee increases for students.  
>  
>The U-PASS program provides like $500 value for $80 per quarter and even with substantial increases to the fee it would be “worth it” to many students who commute. Plus, the last time the fee was raised was 2016 so it’s been a little while.

Lab Fees/Class Fees

I don't know much about Class Fees but it is really dumb that these won't be eliminated, especially if the money was for supplies you won't use. Some classes have lab fees for computer related things and that will, of course, still apply. So far it seems bad but do the following and we might be okay.

**What can you do about all this?**

[Drop out for one quarter. (this is not free)](https://registrar.washington.edu/2020/03/26/spring-quarter-2020-covid-19-faqs)

Contact the UW with any specific issues you have with your situation. [Emergency aid is available and can cover fees.](https://www.washington.edu/emergencyaid/)

Contact ASUW to unify as a student body for State and Federal Support.  [This is actually where the petition comes in handy because it shows high volumes of student support.](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-washington-seattle-partial-tuition-refund-for-spring-2020-at-uw?cs_tk=AnQRv_-s-jPXPv3Ng14AAXicyyvNyQEABF8BvGuLAuh6p1_zwOEWpNyxKWQ=&utm_campaign=36c897f15b8a4f649da65dd56d175e86&utm_content=initial_v0_0_1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=recruit_sign_digest&utm_term=cs&fbclid=IwAR3eibloZJeoOI_xjPFKxiOajb-bGT2LfgxRGpxaST3tcHZnx1Lz53IVDOM)

Contact your state and federal representatives and ask them for support.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [UW Housing](https://hfs.uw.edu/Coronavirus-FAQ-for-Residents)

HFS is offering to not charge any student who won't be on campus for spring quarter housing with no fees for cancellation. The deadline for this request has passed but you can still contact them. Those students have to move out by May 3rd to not get charged. They will also not be charged for a dining plan. This is particularly impressive considering how much of your housing amount goes to paying off the 30-year loans they used to build all the new dorms. I'm sure they have it figured out, but this is actually a big deal.

# [UW Food](https://hfs.uw.edu/Coronavirus-FAQ-for-Residents#UnspentDining)

This is an issue because lots of people have leftover money on their dining plans that they were planning on using during spring quarter, myself included. They will give a partial refund but not a full one mostly because HFS does not take ANY MONEY AT ALL from the state or from tuition. They need dining revenues to cover costs like the chefs and custodians at their dining facilities. They will basically give back all the money they saved by not having to feed 10,000 people for the last two weeks of winter quarter but that won't be the full amount because there were still lots of costs. HFS donates almost all its leftover food to the Food Pantry too, so don't worry about anything being wasted.

# Off Campus Housing

The state has so far not issued a freeze on rents but they have issued a freeze on evictions so if you can't pay and can't get your stuff right away, you will have time to come back. Most landlords should be understanding. [Here is some helpful info on your rights as a tenant.](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/husky-neighborhood-project/landlord-tenant/) Lots of people have begun the process of finding a subletter for their space now instead of waiting until the end of the quarter. The Facebook groups offering these are pretty saturated and there isn't a whole lot of demand but it's worth a shot.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/fqylrn/why_we_still_have_to_pay_full_price_for_tuition/,37,442

n9rg51,Just some advice from my therapist: You May *THINK* you’re doing well under pandemic circumstances but your body subconsciously understands that you need to survive right now and that’s going to manifest in a way that works for you and you might not know it. So take inventory of yourself…,"Prevent yourself from reaching burn out or that pending mental break down. 

Take a second to breathe. Mentally ground yourself. 


My Mom was subconsciously suppressing her emotions caused by the pandemic for an entire year which landed her in the hospital for the worst panic attack that manifested as psycho motor retardation and we didn’t know what actually was wrong with her until her third visit where her panic attack manifested as a pseudo-seizure.

My point is, if you can’t keep going next quarter, don’t. The pandemic threw out whatever self or societal imposed timeline you have to follow. Do what makes you happy. Do what makes you feel healthy. Take care of yourself.

Don’t fucking grind your life away for an institution that’ll say your name once and then never again after you yeet yourself off the aurora bridge. 

You are your #1 fan. Live your fucking life man.

It's ingrained into our lives. Many people, these days, are perfectly content with sitting on their computers all day playing video games. I used to be a competitive gamer and I used to do this. After enrolling at the UW, self-loathing became a new norm that was ingrained into my life. We need it for our wellbeing. It helps us escape from society. There have even been studies that show how necessary self-loathing is for our wellbeing. The fact that it was stripped away from us, especially by something that barely affects us specifically is very detrimental to our mental state.

zsh5zz,Hawaii BBQ Restaurant on the ave is closing around the end of this year,"Hey, I am the owner's son. It has been a good 25 years. I have been a part of this restaurant business since when I was born, since I attended UW, since I graduated, and since I moved on to my own full-time job. I enjoyed my time occasionally working there at the register, wrapping musubis, chugging the chilled hawaiian suns, and bringing my nintendo switch to play with my UW friends. I have also worked on the menu, website, point-of-sale system, and many other things behind the scenes. While I have not lived as long as the restaurant's existence, the memories felt eternal as Hawaii BBQ has deeply influenced my life, and our family's life. One of the earliest fondest memories I had was when the restaurant still over at the old location (50th ave), my sis and I would sleep and play at the restaurant all day. Now that my parents are retiring, both happy and sad for our family, this restaurant will finally see its end. It is time for me to start taking care of my parents. Thank you all for your patronage and thank you for making my time there enjoyable.

ps: i know this post is very sudden but i would encourage you all to visit in person before it permanently shuts down. also the online ordering systems sucks (fees and all), you can always call to order ahead. we'd prefer if you try our dishes fresh :)

oq8s6q,Advice for students moving to campus for the first time that I wish I was given when I was a freshman.,"HFS gives stupid advice and product recommendations. Your RAs are knowledgeable, but they're not the ones in control of the handbooks or websites. This is a collection of random tips I've accumulated in my time living at UW, and from friends of mine at UW and other colleges.  

&#x200B;

DORM SUPPLIES:

&#x200B;

***DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OCM. I ASSUME HFS GETS A CUT OF SALES, BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS ARE GARBAGE.***

&#x200B;

For bedding, look on amazon, there are tons of Twin XL (the size UW beds are) options there for far cheaper and with a better return policy than OCM (The company HFS shills for). Buy a pillow online, at Target, or bring one from home. I promise you they will be higher quality than OCM.

&#x200B;

For towels, go to Target or, if you can, Costco. The towels at Costco are dirt cheap and VERY high quality. Buy two bath towels and a dish towel. You can buy a bath mat, but I would just dry off in the shower and save the $8. 

&#x200B;

**For any kind of kitchenware, GO TO TARGET.** I was able to buy one bowl, one plate, one dish, one fork, one knife, and one spoon for cheap. I recommend bringing some kind of thermos or travel mug to fill up on the free coffee in the dining halls in the morning to avoid buying the exact same coffee at Starbucks for $5. 

&#x200B;

Miscellaneous tips:

\-***DON'T BUY THE EXPENSIVE DINING PLAN.*** I was duped into thinking it was the best option before I set foot on campus (you've probably read the HFS guide saying that anything less than the level 4 will leave you without food half the time, that's complete bunk.) The food on campus is OK at best and very cheap. A meal costs around $8 at most, more with sides, so the $1100 or whatever the level 1 is plan will cover quite a lot. 

&#x200B;

\-Additionally, you're in Seattle. You're a 10 minute walk or a 20 minute bus ride from some of the best food in the world. Don't waste all your college meals on a greasy sub-mcdonalds quality burger. 

&#x200B;

\-Your dining account can be used at the District Market (on-campus grocery store). I wouldn't use actual money here, as its almost all 10-40% more expensive than any other grocery store, but it's a good way to burn the money you won't want to use on junky fast food. 

&#x200B;

\-**Amazon is your friend.** You will forget things. You will break things. You'll be living in Seattle so 90% of packages will be able to be delivered next day, or if you're really lucky, later the same day. If you don't have prime but your parents do, have them set up Amazon Household, which will give you access to free prime shipping.

&#x200B;

\-**Bring batteries and lightbulbs.** These are both weirdly expensive around the University, so buy them and bring them.

&#x200B;

\-**Lighting is a must.** The dorms can get really dark and depressing, especially in overcast Seattle winter, which is all of Seattle winter. I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to spend $50 on a ""mood lamp"", but some fairy lights, desk lamps, floor lamps, or, if you're so inclined and your roommate doesn't object (ASK FIRST) TikTok style LEDs.

&#x200B;

\-On the same line as Lighting, **bring a plant**. Studies have repeatedly shown increased mood, energy, and focus in people who have leafy plants in their environments as compared to those who do not. Pothos, Lucky Bamboo, and Fiddleleaf Fig are all pretty cheap and easy to care for. Spend 10 minutes researching them so you don't kill them instantly and you'll be golden.

&#x200B;

\-Laundry. Doesn't have to be Tide, but **any laundry pod is a lifesaver for dorm laundry.** You don't want to haul a 2 gallon jug of detergent up 5 flights of stairs (unless you're trying to get a leg workout in, in which case go for it). I have a collapsible hamper so I would often bring my laundry down with a pod or two, start it going,  put the hamper in my backpack, then go get lunch on the AVE.

&#x200B;

\-**If you need a mini fridge, see if you can buy used.** I paid $50 on Facebook Marketplace for one that retails for $200. It's a little late now, but graduates often get rid of theirs at the end of the year. Facebook Marketplace is a great place to start looking. 

&#x200B;

\-**Get a Coffee Maker / Electric Kettle.** Either of these will pay for themselves in a month if you drink a lot of Tea, Coffee, or Cocoa (also good for ramen).

&#x200B;

If you're not sure if you'll need something or not, err on the side of conservativism. Dorms are small. You don't want to be like I was and have a bunch of storage bins full of junk I never used, or even wanted to use. Save your money on the front end, don't buy a rice cooker and a, instant pot and an air fryer and a frying pan and 50 other things ""just in case"". If you realize you need something, buy it on Amazon, or go to the store. If Seattle seems expensive, hop on a bus (if I recall correctly the 522 or the 255 will work) and go to Bellevue, Kirkland, or Redmond. On top of seeing more of the area if you're not from here, these towns can be much cheaper (also typically safer for walking alone but that's another issue for another post) than anywhere in Seattle, and unlimited bus fare is included in Tuition. 

&#x200B;

**Off topic but maybe helpful bits of wisdom**

&#x200B;

**-**I always keep a few $1 bills in a pocket with nothing else in it when I'm walking around. This way, if one of the many many beggars around the AVE or Seattle in general comes up and asks, or worse, demands money, I can hand them a small amount without pulling out my whole wallet or risking dropping stuff. You will be asked for money. Sometimes, you will be asked for money in a very forceful way. One wants to assume these are people down on their luck with the best intentions, but the reality is some are dangerous. **NEVER PULL OUT YOUR WALLET WHEN GIVING AN UNHOUSED PERSON OR BEGGAR MONEY.** Many are good people on bad times, some are not. 

&#x200B;

\-This applies to anyone, but especially those who are women or minorities of any kind, and those who are less physically intimidating. **Avoid walking alone** off or near campus. The campus proper is fairly safe, but you go one street in any direction and all bets are off. Do not walk alone, do not walk with headphones on, and do not walk at night. Ensure bags are secure and closed. Probably, you'll never have a problem. Expect the best and plan for the worst. 

&#x200B;

\-**Don't study in your dorm**. I could wax poetic about sleep hygiene all day but it boils down to this: Don't use spaces for all purposes. Sleep in your sleeping space, relax in your relaxation space, study in your study space. There are libraries for studying. They're very nice. Use them. You will be more productive, I promise.

&#x200B;

\-**Find your people.** Don't rely on highschool friends alone for socialization in college. Join a club you're genuinely passionate about, not that you think would look cool to be in. Personally, I've made all my friends at UW through Dungeons and Dragons. Anything that forces groups of 3-6 people together to interact on any personal level will absolutely build relationships. I might make a whole other post about this later. 

&#x200B;

I didn't set out with the intent to write this long of a post (In fact this was originally going to be a 1 paragraph psa about the dining level) but these are genuinely all things that if I had known going into college my first year I would have been much better off. Hopefully this will help at least one person with at least one thing and if it does, it was worth it. If you have any other tips (the real LPT is always in the comments) I'll add them to the list with credit. Feel free to repost or plagiarize any of this, if it would help more people know what they're doing.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/oq8s6q/advice_for_students_moving_to_campus_for_the/,67,383

no0q4b,Safety on the Ave,"I am usually more of a lurker than a poster but I wanted to draw attention to the fact that a lot of women do not feel safe walking near campus. 

I can only share my own experiences but typically when I have experienced catcalling and unwanted attention near campus (the Ave in particular) it’s usually men who are obviously older and more than likely don’t go to UW. Just a few minutes ago, however, I had an interaction with a guy who was definitely of student age so I wanted to address it here. 

Some context. I enjoy walking alone, it provides me some clarity in my typically hectic life. I know that can leave me “more vulnerable” but I take necessary safety precautions (even though I shouldn’t have to). I’m walking down the Ave with my earbuds in and suddenly a guy crosses the street diagonally — IN FRONT OF CARS during a green light to cross over to me. Honestly I didn’t think much of it until he tapped my wrist and gestured for me to take my earbud out. I did and then it’s a spew of “wow, I couldn’t help but notice your beauty and...” and I panic and start walking away. I had to keep turning every block or so to make sure he wasn’t following me, I was still on edge when I started writing this. For everyone here I would love to share some words of wisdom: when a woman — or anyone really — is walking alone (I don’t care if it’s night or day) approaching them while they are alone is already a bit sus and TOUCHING THEM is an absolute no. It’s not flattering, it’s invading personal space. Also — if you do happen to compliment someone in this setting — you are not entitled to a reaction.

n0s58t,The ASUW-Daily spat - more than you think. Recall Camille Hattwig,"The other posts on this are missing the bigger picture - ASUW president Camille Hattwig used the allegations of racism to draw attention away from The Daily's reporting on her nearly fraudulent election practices.

Here's how it down in the context of the election:

1. ASUW doesn't advertise deadlines or other info for the upcoming election so it consists entirely of ASUW insiders running unopposed
2. The Daily calls them out for this
3. Camille fabricates allegations of racism against the Daily to try to delegitimize their very reasonable concerns about the election. In her (somewhat alarmist) email to the entire student body about this, she leaves out any specifics because then people would see that her claims are ridiculous.

I know ASUW is kinda a joke, but it's entirely inappropriate for an elected incumbent to try to delegitimize reasonable criticism from the press about an election. And something really did go wrong with this election - 100% of positions consisting of unopposed insiders shows they used unfair pre-election processes.

Camille should be recalled for this - if any of you know how to get that started we should work on that.

nakstt,RANDOM ADVICE FOR FRESHMEN,"here is a random jumble of advice and info I wish i knew/thought of before coming to UW (much of this is dorm related)

 

* 8 am in high school is very different from 8 am in college. Unless you are absolutely sure that you are a morning person--like the type of person who wakes up at 6 a.m.--do not take classes before 10 a.m.! 
* Get the lowest level dining account. If you find you need more money you can always level your account up, but if you start with an expensive dining account and you don't spend the money, you're screwed.
* You might not like your roommates. It's fine. Even if you talk to them for months before, sometimes it just doesn't work out and that's okay. It happens to a lot of people.
* Closet measurements: that rack for hanging your clothes is 32 inches. (hope this helps y'all not overpack)
* Worried about storage space? Grab yourself one of these bad boys at a very reasonable price from target: https://www.target.com/p/11-8-cube-organizer-shelf-room-essentials-153/-/A-51256587?preselect=15113339#lnk=sametab 
* Don't know who needs to hear this, but you do not need to bring that many pairs of shoes. 
* Bring several towels. Ideally thinner ones so they dry properly.
* Clothes you *need*:  a good rain jacket. Ideally two. Two pairs of rain shoes, either waterproof or water-resistant. That's right, you will thank me for this.
* Don't bring tide pods. The washers don't get hot enough for them to melt. 
* Bringing posters? Scotch mounting putty works great for hanging them on dorm walls! Tape… not so much. 
* Get a minifridge, get a good one! You do not really need a microwave, every dorm floor has two microwaves so you're not going to have to walk super forward to access a fancy and high-quality microwave. 
* You will in fact need a power cord--the outlets are few and far spread so if you plan on having a lamp, your computer, a clock, and phone plugged in at your desk, you will need this. 
* Buy one of those eye masks for sleeping and practice sleeping in it. Well look stupid and it's not the most comfortable at first, you and your roommate will thank me when it's 2 a.m. and you want to sleep, and they need to have the lights on so they can stay awake and cram study for a test.  no matter the brightness or what time of day it is, you put that sucker on, and it's pitch black and perfect for sleeping.
* there is no AC in the dorms. you have a heater in your room but the highest I can go is 74 degrees. It autoshuts on at 55 degrees. Thus far it has not gotten hot enough that I would want AC but just a heads up it isn't an option.
* Bring lights. Lamps, string lights, anything. The dorm lighting sucks and the rooms are so gloomy, dark, and depressing. 
* There will be very little daylight during the winter months. Some days, if you sleep in late and wake up at 3 p.m, you open your blinds to find it is already dark outside. During these months make sure you get up and experience a few hours of sunlight a day or you will get seasonal depression. It's very real, and it sucks. 
* ALEKS is evil. Learn to fear and hate the name, chances are you'll understand later. 
* Sometimes there are homeless people wandering around West Campus. Most of them are chill, some of them are weird. Sometimes the front of the dorm buildings smells like human urine.
* The dining hall food sucks. Buy yourself a pan, pot, spatula, knife, mixing bowl, and cutting board from target or Ikea or somewhere in case you ever cook. That's honestly about all you need....
* Bring a vacuum. And a duster. The dorm's floors get so dirty so fast, and the room gets so damn dusty from the vents. 
* Do not overload your schedule! College classes are a lot more self-taught than High School. Balance is important, for everyone hard class you're taking, balance it with a passion class or a fun class your first quarter to allow yourself breathing room to adjust. Pair your chem class with a film appreciation class or psychology of human sexuality, and your bio class with ceramics or creative writing. You get the idea.
* Do not hook up with someone on your dorm hall floor, rookie mistake and it is awkward for the whole year. I did not do it but I know too many people who did eek
* Spreadsheet, spreadsheet, spreadsheet! Canvas and it's annoying to use in my opinion, the only way I kept from forgetting assignments as I spent hours the first day of school making a spreadsheet ordering all the assignments, tests, quizzes, and projects to speak to a spreadsheet organized by date. Then throughout the quarter I just stayed ahead and crossed stuff off the list.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/nakstt/random_advice_for_freshmen/,29,326

t8bcvt,It's that time: the annual 'go to community college (seriously)' plea,"The post title is tongue-in-cheek, but hear me out. There's a lot of sincerity in people telling you to do this.

It's admissions season, and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're one of thousands of freshmen who didn't make the cut for admissions this year. And that sucks. There's no diminishing it, especially if you're like many UW students who were a part of some Honors or AP program that was priming you for the Straight to College pipeline, and telling you that anything less was abject failure.

(Or maybe you just have Asian parents.)

I'm here to tell you why community college is a perfectly valid path that'll still bring you to the UW, how to make it work for you, and if I'm doing a good job, you might come to find it was the smarter decision anyway. This is coming from someone who applied to UW in his senior year of high school and, having finished that last semester with a 1.7 GPA, predictably did not get in. It was pretty devastating: high school sucked, and as a little baby gay, I couldn't see myself being happy anywhere but Seattle. I applied again a decade later (you don't need to wait this long) having job experience, an AA earned with highest honors, and a much clearer direction of where I wanted to take my life - and these have been among the best years of my life because of it. So not only am I writing this to the freshmen who were hyped and pumped up to get here, but I'm also writing to people who also have started to wonder if college was in reach for them *at all*: because of their abilities, because of a garbage high school experience, because their family is poor, etc. **You can make it happen.**

I work with other CC transfer students *a lot*. It's not all sunshine and daisies, but there are minimal regrets - and a number of commonly-cited reasons as to why community college was the best decision for them:

**1)** **$$$**

The big one everyone will talk about is money, and for good reason: **a single 5-credit course at UW costs about as much as a full-time quarter at a WA state community college.** On the whole, you're going to spend about a third as much on your first two years compared to someone who went straight to UW. Unless your family is already wealthy, this is a pretty attractive point to anyone - and it's half the reason why, as a first-gen student, grad school is even a future possibility for me. 

Bonus for OOS (non-international) students: CC tuition isn't that much more expensive for you compared to the baseline (~$130/cred vs. $116/cred), while UW would have you paying 3-4x as much - to the point that many will tell you to just not come here OOS unless you're mega-wealthy. For OOS students, this can be a great opportunity to establish yourself & work towards residency, but that is a *whole ass process* you'll want to talk to the professionals about.

Further: community colleges usually have foundations that collect and hand out scholarships like candy to students with big aspirations, while here the odds can be so long you might have a better chance fighting the other applicants to the death in the gladiator pit under Condon Hall.

**2)** **Better Academics**

Big prerequisite classes for more competitive majors - math, bio, chem, the works - are colloquially called 'weedouts', with pretty brutal exams and grading curves. A quick search on this sub will show you what the experience is like. Many of these can be taken at a CC and transferred in - and you'll probably have a more accessible professor, classroom aides, and a class size about a tenth of what you'd find here. Even current UW students will often dip a CC course during the summer just to avoid how utterly miserable they can be here.

Beyond skipping weedouts, WA state CCs are among the best in the country. Many CC professors very much teach foremost out of a passion for helping their students.  For the first time in my life, I didn't hate math, and I was able to ace statistics - which was unthinkable for me at the time (and UW straight up taught me to hate it again anyways lmaoo). I took biology with a professor who I later learned had began at that same community college, went to UW for undergrad microbio with awards for research excellence, and went on to get his PhD. He played chill Hollow Knight ambience during our exam days. Honestly, I'll probably remember more of my CC profs than my UW ones by the time I'm in my career field.

**3)** **Easier Accessibility**

This is a broad one, but: unless you're taking out loans or coasting on your parent's dime in the dorms, making an education happen at UW is *hard*. Seattle has a high cost of living and many students have to live outside and commute 1-2h every day. Prior to the pandemic, the university basically went out of its way to *not* offer online courses, while many CCs have them as a staple. The time and money you save just by not having to struggle to *be* here are resources you can put into yourself, your extracurriculars, and planning out your transfer to make the most of your time here.

**4)** **Lots of involvement opportunities**

This is true at UW, too, but it's just more accessible here. Become a student leader, go work with student life, get hired as a tutor, join a robotics club. Tied in with the Accessibility bit above, you'll have more room on your plate to volunteer or intern somewhere. CC is no different from UW in this regard, though: to make these things happen, you have to go search for them. People will tell you that the degree you get here matters a lot less than the connections you made or the opportunities you embraced, and IMO that same message rings true for your community college experience.

**5)** **Life perspective**

This one is ambiguous, but bear with me. My very first community college class was English 101. I sat a table with an international student from Japan, a 40-year-old military veteran who was working on getting a degree in machining, and a woman in her late 20s who I later learned had been on the streets for about a year before transitional housing became available for her. By the time the quarter started, she'd been off the streets for just a month. In the span of her two years there, she'd go on to study IT and get an internship with T Mobile, who later hired her for about $70k starting.

When you sit in a stuffy lecture hall at UW with a bunch of college-bound kids from career college families, you rarely get these kind of stories. You don't get the same perspective on how 'Success' can mean different things to different people, how it's equally as valid, and the sacrifices some people have to make in order to make their education happen. Where's UW on the US News College Rankings? What's your SAT score? Did you apply to Ivies? At that table, *nobody fucking cared*. It's hard to describe how valuable that lesson is: the way it changes how you see and interact with other people, how it reframes your perspective on yourself and your education, and what it all means to you. You've probably spent 4 years on a rat-race gifted high schooler track; step off it, just for a little while.

This experience translates to your time at UW in a way that professors notice, too. Professors fucking love transfer students. They've got life experience, tend to be less full of anxiety and bullshit, and are often among the best participators in their classrooms. Student & campus jobs will love you, too. There's transfer shock, sure, but when you get here, a lot of transfers feel pretty ahead of the pack, and if they planned their transfer well they get to drop right into the heart of their major's core classes.

----

Getting through your two years at CC is one thing, but if you can do that, honestly the path forward is simple:

1. Use your time at CC to explore majors and figure out what you want to do.
2. Take some time to think about how your desired career path impacts the world, or a problem or disadvantaged communities in it. There's a world beyond academia: engage with it.
3. Get involved, somewhere. Bonus points if it's tied into the above. Think about how that's relevant to your desired career path.
4. Go to class. Get those grades.
5. Write a bomb-ass essay that ties all the above together, and show them how dumb they'd have to be to *not* take you.

If you have your heart set here, for whatever reason, and didn't make it in: go to community college. Seriously. I hope the ramblings of a former lost teen help at least one person out there also feeling like a lost teen today.",Admissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/t8bcvt/its_that_time_the_annual_go_to_community_college/,26,316

lkfa1d,Protecting the health of students learning in different time zones: a letter to the UW administration,"*This message is being sent to Ana Mari Cauce (the President of UW), the Daily of UW, and the general audience.*

Dear UW Administrators,

I am writing this letter to raise awareness of the challenges on the health of student learning in different time zones. In this letter, I present those challenges and potential solutions to mitigate those problems. I invite the UW administration to take actions to address those challenges to build a more inclusive global community.

**Executive Summary**

Amid the pandemic, many students have to learn in different time zones synchronously under current university policy, compromising their health. University policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced to protect the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones. Established policies such as the elimination of attendance for grading need to be enforced. Policy changes should focus on making time schedules of assessments and discussion sessions more flexible.

**Background**

Amid COVID-19 pandemic, students have to stay at home and learn remotely in different time zones inside and outside of the US. Most international students, especially, experience drastic time differences when trying to attend lectures and exams live from their home countries.

Attending classes live with hours of difference is not easy. For students studying in Hawaii, a 8:30 am PST class translates to attendance at 6:30 am local time. For students studying in East Asia, a 10:30 am PST class could mean staying up late 2:30 pm \[correction: am\] late night every weekday. Such time difference not only translates to disadvantages when learning materials and taking exams, it also disturbs the students’ circadian clock, causing adverse effects on the student’s physical and mental health.

The adverse effects are not theoretical, nor are they overstated. On February 8th, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute grieves the passing of Kaijie Zhang, “a first-semester freshman studying remotely from his family home in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China” \[1\]. Taking classes at night and its associated adverse effects are allegedly the main cause of this tragedy. To prevent such tragedies from happening at UW and for the health of all students learning in different time zones, university policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced. I am confident that these problems will be addressed because “the health and safety of our students, staff, faculty and academic personnel is our University’s highest priority,” writes our President Ana Mari Cauce in her message “The safety of our community is our highest priority” \[2\].

**Problems and Recommendations**

*Time Schedule Planning*

While synchronous classes with diverse time schedules and asynchronous classes could solve the problem, they are not realistic in large scale because of limited teaching resources and limited learning experience, respectively. However, I suggest the university to explicitly encourage the planning of lecture and quiz sections (if they have multiple sections) at very different times.

For instance, many courses currently offers section A at 9:30 am and section B at 10:30 am, providing students little time flexibility. Instead, the policy could encourage planning of section A at 9:30 am and section B at 4:30 pm, accommodating for students from different time zones.

I understand that such strategy may not work for all courses because of limitations such as their sizes, instructor availability, and time conflicts. Nevertheless, a small change in the schedule could benefit a large population of students. In addition, FERPA-compliant recordings of synchronous lecture should be required to be uploaded to the cloud for students all students for reference, giving all student the possibility of asynchronous learning.

*Exam Policy*

Another issue that students learning from different time zones face is awkward exam schedule. If a course is offered synchronously, regardless whether its materials are posted for asynchronous learning, its exams are usually strictly synchronous, without exceptions (other than that required by university policy). For example, a student studying from East Asia may have to take an exam 3:30 am local time at night for an unnegotiable exam time of 11:30 am PST. Again, such late time is not only an disadvantage to academic performance, but it is also poisonous to the students’ physical and mental health. This is easily understandable: if student do not expect instructors to teach late night to accommodate for students in different time zones, then instructors should not expect students in different time zones to take examinations late night.

As a concrete example, many exams in the Department of Chemistry must be taken synchronously, without exceptions for students learning in different time zones, because instructors “see less issues with academic ethics & integrity if all students take the exam concurrently.” Even worse, it is quoted as a departmental policy. This would not be a problem if classes were in person, but remote instruction has to consider of time zone differences to be inclusive of students learning in different time zones.

Synchronous exam policies have to be changed. I recommend exams for remote learning to have a time window of 24 hours to start the exam, providing students from different time zones an equal opportunity to perform in their time zones. Indeed, such policy may raise concerns on academic integrity; however, policies should not punish students who did nothing wrong: the time zone students are in are not in their control. In contrast, the choice to adhere to the honor code and take the exam with honesty is in the hands of every student. In addition, student who decide to cheat in asynchronous exams is likely to cheat in synchronous section regardless, having no correlation with whether students learning from different time zones should have a fair time to take the exam. Therefore, exam policies need to be changed so that every student has an equal opportunity to demonstrate their performance and a healthy schedule without late night classes.

*Enforcement of Policies*

After appropriate revision to the university policies, those policies need to be strictly enforced so that the students can benefit from those policies to have a flexible learning experience. If no enforcement is placed and no feedback channel is available for students, students would not be benefitted from those policies. Thus, I recommend the university to establish ways for students to provide feedback and express concerns on remote teaching related to course policies to the administration level (independent to those mid-quarter survey that are for instructional feedback).

*Attendance Policy*

Here, I present one example of the consequence of the lack of policy enforcement: the attendance policy is not practiced by instructors. The university policy on remote teaching has a clear guideline on grading synchronous attendance: “Attendance – Don’t factor in attendance as part of grading” \[3\]. However, many instructors still grade attendance directly or indirectly. Take an Organic Chemistry course as an example, its grading takes synchronous Poll Everywhere responses as 4% of the total grade, stating that “you will only be able to answer the questions during lecture, not while watching the lectures on Panopto later on,” forcing students to attend synchronously without considering students learning in different time zones. As a solution, I recommend quarterly inspection of course syllabus as a part of policy enforcement, in the hope that instructors will follow university policies, just like students should follow university policies, too.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, university policies need to be revised and enforced so that the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones can be protected. The change to university policies can also provide more equitable examination opportunities. I invite the UW administration to respond by taking concrete actions to improve the policies, building a more inclusive community.

This has been a huge breakthrough for me because up until recently I’ve always kind of felt like I didn’t belong at UW, like I was a fake husky. When I originally applied to this school I was rejected and the only reason I got in was because I was able to successfully petition them. My first year was extremely rough I literally failed a class each quarter and I started regretting and questioning my decision to come here. Maybe the UW admissions staff was right in the first place? Maybe I should’ve gone to WSU, idk. This last year though I really started trying to get my crap together, and I really started to just focus on what I wanted to do instead of what I was expected to do. It wasn’t a perfect year but my gpa slowly recovered. After all my hard work and finally being told that I belong here. That I can pursue what I want to do with my life, idk it just makes me want to cry.

gg7sy7,From Cheating in CSE 143 to a Full Time Programming Role,"**As I am seeing that many admission decisions are coming out I thought now would be a good time to share the (success) story of my journey at UW, which is coming to an end this quarter.**

  
Like many hopefuls I came into the UW hoping to do Computer Science. I had built my own computer in High School, I thought coding was fascinating, I saw that it was a field that was employable and paid well. Like many up until I started at UW I didn't really realize the work it took to be successful, and I wasn't prepared for the competitive nature that UW cultivates. 

By the end of **my first year** I knew I would never be a CS student. I took CSE 143 that winter with my roommate, we were both struggling on an assignment and he sent me an ""example"" of a past quarter's submission found online. As I soon found out, you can change every single variable name and you will still get caught. The program they run is able to see the structure of the code and compares it to their database of submissions. That crushed me, and was one of the hardest lessons I had to learn my Freshman year. Having to own up to my own mistake and look past it shook my world for the better. We both got caught and I don't blame my roommate at all.

I was able to finish the prerequisite courses to Informatics just in time to apply my Freshman year. I wrote a piss-poor essay which I was revising with 10 minutes left to the deadline. In retrospect of course I'm not surprised at all that I wasn't admitted, but at the time I was still partially in the mindset that life would just work out for me. 

After getting rejected my **Sophomore year** with an actually well written and revised essay I was heartbroken. In my head I still was set on Info as my backup major and didn't have another backup, I didn't have the prerequisites or grades for ACMS or any Math heavy major. A friend of mine had recommended GIS in Geography as a tech-related alternative and by the end of the year I was a declared Geography Major. I still wanted to program for a living and still was hoping to get into Info my Junior year. I had it calculated that I could take Info classes on the side and still graduate in 4 years if I was admitted then.

So many students I see on this sub-reddit put an incredible emphasis on getting into their major. Which is a great goal to work towards, but it isn't the ""end all be all""! I finally came to realize around this point that *my Major wasn't what was going to get me that desired job after college, it was the skills was able to gain and retain from my studies*. This was when I got my first internship paying minimum wage at a research center downtown to help add data visualizations to their website. I got this through applying to nearly every data science related *Undergraduate Research Program listing.*

For my **Junior year** Informatics essay I was actually so ticked at the system that my essay was about how my Major and grades don't define my capabilities in life. haha! Long story short I didn't get in then either, and was officially going to be graduating as a Geography Major. I continued to take Informatics and the non-major CSE courses that I was able to get into and began applying like crazy to internship roles for the next summer. I likely *applied to over 100 roles mostly on sites like Glassdoor*. I got my second internship at a recreational equipment company working on their employee management system/database. Around this time I also secured a part-time engineering internship at a telecommunications giant that would go throughout my senior school year. When I applied and accepted these Internships my resume still had Informatics as my intended major even though I was denied from the program a few weeks afterwards. 

This might apply to tech more than other majors but *don't think that because you didn't get into your major you aren't qualified or able to get that role you want or be successful in the future*. Fight through it and apply everywhere! **Work experience is so much more valuable than any major title or course.** 

The Geography major is not incredibly technical and even though I'm seeing this Data Science option that has been recently added to it, after looking at the courses, it's not that much more intensive. Geography courses all hold your hand through the material and if you do major in I highly recommend going above and beyond. I was able to take every single non-major CSE course except for AI and the photography one. In Informatics I was able to get the Android, iOS, and Server-side courses (don't take professionalism), many people assumed I was in the major.

For a while I regretted not transferring when the Geography major initially disappointed me, but in retrospect two factors made staying worth it, the reduced in-state tuition (probably saved over $50,000 in debt), and simply *the amount of opportunities in Seattle*. All my internships were located in Seattle and being able to be at school so close gave me the opportunities to go to interviews (of which I got rejected from many) and eventually find internships. 

This Summer I start work full time as a Diagnostics Engineer writing programs that monitor and help to maintain cell phone service around the country, I get to work with massive amounts of data, and am making a 6 figure salary right out of college. To everyone who has been rejected from any major, know that it isn't the end of the world and you can and will bounce back.

n1x6tf,(Semi-opiniated) summary of last nights ASUW BOD meeting,"During the first \~15 minutes, some BSU representatives speak and thank Camille and the ASUW board for their ""professionalism."" Followed by member of the public asking ASUW why they sent a mass alarmist email to tens of thousands of people. Camille says they're ""not doing back-and-forth"" and doesn't provide a response. (I'm unclear if this is standard for public forums, so maybe give her the benefit of the doubt here?)

Bulk of the meeting (over an hour) was about pretty standard/hiring/administrative stuff. 

Time was allocated at the end for the board to discuss The Daily. One of the board members asked about the email, why it was sent out, and who knew about it. Camille said she met with ""all relevant stakeholders"" prior to the email being sent. Board member pushes a bit more on the stakeholders question, Camille says it's not an appropriate discussion for a board meeting.

Board member asks if she met with The Daily, as they are a relevant stakeholder. Camille waffles a bit, and says that yes, The Daily was consulted prior to the mass email being sent. 

(Wild accusation: based on the context here, I got the feeling that she was misrepresenting the truth. The Daily's response doesn't really line up with what she was saying here, and she made it very clear that she was more concerned with stakeholders other than The Daily. )

Camille speaks about her rationale for sending the email. She argued that since the original racist cartoon was sent to every student, she needed to send a follow-up response to every student. Says that it's important to ""show support for the students being harmed by the institutions at play."" 

(Look, I don't know about the rest of you, but I regularly see The Daily in my inbox. I don't regularly see alarmist emails from the ASUW president. There was no fucking reason to send this spam to everyone.)

She went on and explained that the BOD candidates have the least amount of power in this situation, because The Daily can reach tens of thousands of people, so she felt compelled to use her power to do the same to support the candidates. She said her biggest concern and the point of her statement was not ""what the public thinks,"" its the impact this has had on Black students. ""The goal was not to explain things clearly or make the broader student community understand.""

(It's true the candidates don't have access to a mailing list of the student body. But they will next year. To put it another way, they're unopposed candidates for public office, they are guaranteed to have power next year, no matter what The Daily does or says. It's frankly mind-boggling, then, that the current administration thinks its appropriate to step into this fight use their power to attack the press.)

Camille starts talking about next steps for ASUW, and what steps they can take to ""never worry again about students of color being targeted."" The board discusses options for potentially taking further actions against The Daily, specifically options to censure/censor The Daily.

(Okay, the wording is really important here, and even with context, I'm honestly not sure if they were talking about censuring or censoring. Regardless, either would effectively be a government action against the free press).

Then the board start talking about how much they appreciate The Daily's independent reporting. Camille says that critiquing the ASUW is well within The Daily's right (yet they continue talking about ""accountability"" measures.) The meeting mostly winds down after this.

Overall, I'm unhappy with ASUW's conduct and their attacks on The Daily are concerning at best. Curious if anyone else who attended the meeting has additional thoughts.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1x6tf/semiopiniated_summary_of_last_nights_asuw_bod/,27,297

xejitq,Thank you to the guy who saved me from the crazy lady in the U District.,"About an hour ago, this crazy lady approached me in front of my apartment building in the U District. I don't know her. She held the door open so that I couldn't close it behind me and screamed insults at me. I don't know why but I just froze up... like everything got quiet. I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. 

This random guy suddenly appeared and interrupted her by saying, ""Excuse me."" He looked like he was trying to get past her into our building.

I've been developing strategies to try to manipulate the curve to be favorable to me and I think I might have an idea. The last time I showered was yesterday morning (Sunday) at approximately 9:06 AM. I've been inside since then. I plan to visit the IMA monday morning hit my quads and glutes, NOT shower, then revisit again that same night and target shoulders.

The next day (Tuesday, day of 126 exam), I plan to visit the IMA at least twice before the midterm (begins at 2:30 PM). In these two sessions, I will attempt to target areas that will produce the most odor, such as my asshole. I suspect I will thoroughly start smelling like a rancid cumrag at this point.

I plan to arrive somewhat late to the exam and try to strategically seat myself in the middle of the room. My hopes are that my putrid body odor will distract exam-takers in the room there-by lowering the curve.

The only thing that might foil my plans is if the proctors decide to remove me from the room. Is it possible for them to kick me out of the room?",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ycqvqq/will_i_get_kicked_out_of_my_exam/,52,289

per9vl,An open letter the University of Washington,"The University of Washington has condemned me and other disabled students with immune deficiency, as well as their families. Every 12 hours I take two medications to prevent my body from recognizing foreign solid organs that I received as part of a transplant. Because of this, I am more susceptible to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, something I have known for a long time. What many don’t know is that an additional consequence of these medications is reduced vaccine efficacy. I have received two doses, a booster, and have had COVID-19, and I still lack the antibodies to fight the disease.

The University of Washington, like many other universities across the country, has opted for in-person learning this fall. Most students and faculty are eager for the opportunity to be back on campus. However, the harsh reality for some is that the options provided by the university are subpar, dangerous, and are directly against access to learning for all students. I know I am not the only student with an immune deficiency, and I know that there are students with family members who are immune deficient.

The options before myself, as presented by the DRS, are as follows: hope that professors are willing to alter their course structures significantly to accommodate a single student, take less courses, request accommodations through the DRS which they have stated will be extremely limited and hard to acquire, or take the quarter off. Most of these place undue stress on students and instructors, both emotionally as well as financially.

With little over a month until the beginning of fall quarter, myself and my living partner have had no access to resources to protect ourselves from COVID-19 on campus. I have options, as listed above, however, my partner  — who sleeps next to me — has been told that there are no options for them, because they have no disability, making what little accommodations provided to myself useless so long as my partner must return to in-person learning.

I thank all the professors and advisors who’ve been corresponding with my partner and I this summer, trying to help in any way possible, and informing us that the university refuses to provide professors with guidance and resources for specific cases. This is the direct responsibility of the university, to provide guidance for student and faculty guidance, and reassurances that they will support all types of learning to guarantee that students can become educated in the safest and most effective way possible.

So while summer winds its way to a close and we continue to sit at home keeping our minds and bodies as active in any safe manner possible, the fall looms with unanswered questions, anxiety about more than assignments, and a sadness that the university I was once so proud to be a part of has become such a risk.

and to the stellar profs and TAs who may be out there, thanks for your luv and support. i've been kept afloat by some great instructors this quarter, and would definitely be much worse off right now if not for their generosity. so if you haven't heard it already today, thank you!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/m07oyk/sending_love_to_professors/,18,277

12xskne,My personal Ave foods tier list,"Happy to see some discussion over food on the ave, I've kept track of every meal I had on the ave in the past three years. The reason Seattle has no Michelin star restaurants is because there hasn't been a PNW Michelin guide, so there hasn't been an opportunity for any places to earn a star. Also, I use Aladdin's as the dividing line between A-tier and B-tier. I usually end up changing what I think of a place when I try more of their menu, so if there I particular dishes I have missed/should try, please let me know!  


A Tier:

YGF Malatang

I used to think I wasn't a soup guy, but a bowl of this on a cold, rainy day is one of my favorite meals in Seattle. I basically got a little bit of every option the first time, which ended up being pretty expensive, but still delicious. Haven't tried all the seafood, but in general I liked everything but the various meatballs/sausage. Highly recommend the gourd, tiny mushrooms, and the greens that look like chrysanthemum leaves for things I wasn't sure I'd like and ended up loving.

Chili's South Indian

Lamb Chettinadu Curry: Very good chicken, perfectly tender, perfectly spicy. Very flavorful. Portions were a little small, especially for the price. Had the chicken version later with a friend, also delicious

Malabar Chicken Curry: Had more veggies than the Chettinadu curry, which I liked. Also delicious.

The Alley

Spicy Pork Skillet: Everything was delicious, a lot of good sides. Second best value in a meal besides Saigon deli, but I think the price went up since the first time I've been there

Bugis

Hot Spicy Chicken Bowl: Delicious. Salad with good dressing, teriyaki chicken, rice, pickled onion, boiled egg. Fairly small portion of chicken and rice, salad was simple but very good. Whole dish came together great.

Vegetarian Tofu Bowl (spicy, noodles): Pretty good, the second-best vegetarian meal I've had on campus. Pretty standard egg noodle in spicy teriyaki sauce with broccoli and carrots. Outside of the tofu was really good, what really brought down the dish was that the broccoli, tofu, and sliced boiled egg were cold. You can solve this by letting the dish sit for a little, but it's still off-putting.

Mama's Viet Kitchen

Seitan Lemongrass: The greatest vegan dish I've ever had. When the dish came out, I was initially hesitant, as I don't usually eat vegetarian, and I like having a good amount of meat to go with my veggies. As it got closer, the smell hit me, and it was absolutely incredible. The vegetables also looked pretty great up close. On tasting them, they were perfectly, truly perfectly, seasoned and cooked. The only request I would make would be to serve the veggies right on top of the rice, so the rice has more time to soak up the flavor.

Chimac

Assorted Wings: Quality of the meat was really high, sauces weren't that good, dry rub was way better. Skip the corn. Pride chicken is delicious, chicken tenders are good, snow wings are a really good dry rub

Cedar's

Naan was pretty good, samosas were really good, lots of filling. Chicken was very tender.

Village Sushi

Sushi Regular: Good variety, it was all delicious. The wasabi was very good.

Shultzy's

French Dip Cheesesteak: Coleslaw was vinegary, fries were very thin, which was good but hard to eat non-messily with ketchup. Excellent meat quality and quantity, perfectly balanced with onion and swiss cheese, bread and au jus was great, they only give you half a roll which wasn't great for the price.

Jai Thai UW

Crispy Garlic Chicken: Delicious. Chicken was very good, perfectly crunchy, saucy without being soggy. Vegetables were perfectly cooked, the carrots, broccoli, and other greens were delicious. The entire dish came together fantastically.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

B Tier:

Aladdin Gyro-Cery

Aladdin Veggie Roll: Not great. Falafel was delicious, but the whole roll was a little dry and flavorless. The baklava was large, and pretty good.

Aladdin's Special Gyro(Lamb and Beef): Very good, a bit less greasy and more salad-y than Sultan Gyro Grill, could be a plus or minus depending on the person. Ratio of meat to sauce to pita to greens was perfect, meat was tender and salty, garlic sauce was very good.

Falafel Sandwich: Surprisingly little falafel, incredibly dry, not very saucy. Basically a falafel salad sandwich.

Kofta Sandwich: Not good, basically just a burger patty with tahini

Aladdin Fries(lamb): Delicious, lamb was perfectly tender with a thin but excellent crunch around the outside. Drink water with it or you'll mummify, maybe a few too many fries but some people love the fries so who knows

Voula's Offshore Cafe

Little Squeaker Sandwich and Potato Salad: Very good, meat was a bit thin and not tender, but flavorful. Bread was good, and soaked up the perfect sauciness. Tomato went well with it, and I don't like tomatoes. Potato salad was balanced between creamy and firm, I really liked the red onion in it.

Country Fried Steak: Eggs were good, hashbrowns were decent, english muffins were very good. Gravy was alright, country fried steak was alright, a bit salty but it goes well with the egg and hashbrowns.

Costa's

Original Eggs Benedict: Really good, I don't really like ham but it was still good, that's how good it was.

Next to try: Kotopita + Galaktoboureko

Ivar's Walk-Up Salmon Bar

Chowder Bowl, Fried Scallops, Fried Clams: Pretty good greasy spoon fare, view out front isn't great, bridge is very loud

Henry's Taiwanese Kitchen

Three Cup Chicken: Pretty good, rice in the sauce was delicious and the greens were good, but the chicken wasn't very tender. It was like a very sweet soy sauce, but not quite teriyaki.

Pho Shizzle

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki: Good size, chicken was a bit too crispy for me, flavor of the teriyaki wasn't great, could have had more salad. The side sauces were really good.

The Alley

Spicy Pork Bulgogi: Pretty good overall, good presentation

Byrek and Baguette

Ground Beef Byrek: Meat pastry, blackened around the edges, cold by the time it was served.

Roasted Pork Baguette: Delicious, reminds me of Un Bien, maybe not quite as good but also a lot less messy, so easier to eat without feeling self conscious.

Kai's Thai Street Food

Pad Kra Tiem: Pretty good, not really very memorable though.

Sultan Gyro Grill

Kufta: Alright. A little greasy and salty, hot sauce was good, great texture overall.

U:Don

Pretty greasy noodles, good prices on some items. Not exactly fine dining, but still pleasant comfort food.

Mee Sum Pastry

Mongolian Beef: Solid Beef + Onion dish, very tender beef

Sweet Alchemy Ice Cream

Sweet Cream: I'm not an ice cream person, but it's the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had.

H-Mart

Only place I've found Meiji chocolates, so it gets an honorary spot on the list

Saint Bread

Saint Burger and Cookie: Saint burger was a single patty, shredded lettuce, cheese, pickles, aioli. Best buns I've ever had, perfectly toasty. Excellent, simple burger.

Been back with friends a few other times, I think the burger's the best thing I've had

&#x200B;

C Tier:

Saigon Deli:

BBQ Pork Sandwich: Delicious bread, egg was a little runny. Great ratios of ingredients, bbq pork wasn't noteable.

Aladdin's Burgers

Beef and Lamburgghini: Decent smash burgers

Little Duck

Beef Fried Rice, Mushroom and Chicken Soup, Hot and Spicy Chicken: Soup was good, the rest wasn't great. Lots of bone pieces in the soup, hot and spicy chicken is basically spicy chicken nuggets.

Shawarma King

Lamb Shawarma Sandwich, Basbousa: Delicious, kind of a lamb burrito, perfectly flavorful and saucy. Basbousa was kinda gritty, but was also moist with a honey-sweet syrup, very good.

Lamb Salad: Not very good, salad was cold and wet which cooled down the lamb, the lamb was not very tender

Gyro Sandwich: Not good, nothing about it tasted great or really worked with any other ingredient

Chocolate Roll: Not very chocolatey, more of a fig-newtony kind of roll. Probably on the level of a nutrigrain bar.

Agua Verde Cafe

Chicken Burrito: Creamy, but the chicken wasn't very flavorful. Small for the price.

Chorizo Breakfast burrito: The thermal temperature of this burrito was sufficient to plasmify the air around me for ten minutes. The burrito was cheesy and greasy, not bad, a bit heavy for breakfast.

A Taste of Xi'an

Bean soup, hot oil pulled noodle: Pretty good, was definitely something new. Might try skewers next time

Mr. Bian Dumplings

Bian Dumplings, Pork and shrimp dumplings: A bit expensive for the volume. Shrimp wasn't very flavorful, bian dumplings were better. Overall kind of plain.

Guanaco's Pupuseria

Pretty small, good variety of flavors

Xi'an Noodles

Spicy Pork Noodles: Service time was pretty long, presentation is pretty poor but the taste is pretty good. Kind of felt like I could make it at home though.

BB's Teriyaki

Veggie Stir Fry, Brown Rice, Spicy Chicken, Spicy Sauce: Decent portion size. A little greasy, generally forgettable. Veggie stir fry was just wilted salad, skip.

Mark's Thai Food Box

Pork Ribs: Not great. Curry and rice wasn't very good, ribs were neither meaty nor tender. Dish was a little cold overall, the egg was the best fried egg I'd ever had.

Jewel of India

Mixed Grill, Lamb Samosas, Chicken Jalfrazie, Gulab Jamun: Mixed grill and jalfrazie was alright, nothing special. Samosas were really good, Gulab Jamun was too cardamom-y for my taste.

Nasai Teriyaki

Spicy Chicken: Pretty basic chicken teriyaki. Was made very quickly, which I like. A lot of people seem to really like it, maybe I got the wrong dish?

Ate O'Clock Thai

Hot Spicy Thai Basil: Not very spicy, veggies were alright but meat was fairly poor quality. Not worth the price.

Just Burgers

Tennessee w/ Curly Fries: A little overcooked, sauces were good and onion was delicious, but overall very greasy.

Thanh Vi

Banh Mi Combo: Short for a Banh Mi, the most generic Banh Mi I've ever eaten

Araya's Place

Veggie Cakes, Kaeng Ka-Ri: Good vegan food, and large portions, but incredibly expensive

Dubpop Asian Fusion

General Tao's Chicken: Not very good flavor on the sauce, pretty good serving size for the price.

Chipotle

Pollo Asada: They'll give you too much rice and beans if you let them put both on. Otherwise, pretty good burrito, Anita's on Aurora (and El Camion) are way better

Korean Tofu House Express

Bibimbap: Not a lot of meat, but sauce was good, so way rice + veggies. 

Time Bistro

Garlic Chicken and Rocket Shrimp Wraps: Bland, nothing special

Samurai Noodle

Tonkatsu Ramen: Not great. Salty/creamy isn't really my thing, the pickled veggie and pork weren't great, and the noodles were a little too squishy.

Cedars of Lebanon

Marinated Chicken Sandwich: A little bland, kind of like a chicken salad sandwich.

Panda Noodles

Veggie Fried Rice: A little heavy on the soy sauce, otherwise a standard bowl of fried rice.

Little Thai Restaurant

Clao Cook Gapi and Fish Cakes: Fish cakes rather bland, not very crispy. Egg was overcooked, maybe a bit too much rice for the beef, the portion was good overall but maybe not for the price. Beef was pretty good, got the second-spiciest level and it wasn't very spicy. They do have a fish tank, which is a huge plus.

Sushi Burrito

Dragon Ball: Criminally overpriced, even with the uw guide coupon. Pretty good, and didn't skimp on the eel, the shrimp didn't really add anything.

Samir's Mediterranean

Lamb Gyro: Spicy meat, a little bland on the whole",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/12xskne/my_personal_ave_foods_tier_list/,60,273

if they can send us cloth masks that people still use today, why can't they send us n-95's to protect us all? the inaccessibility to n-95's is so wrong...

e5sdhq,Daily Review: Burrito at Center Table,"Dear HFS,

On my post yesterday you said to continue sharing our feedback, I feel obliged: please accept my following review.

I got a beef burrito today, which soon became a bowl thanks to the creative wrapping. I quite liked it, the quantity was good.

However if I were to try improve on your recipe I would use a tortilla which isn't stale.

I might also find that it would be quicker and cheaper to go to Chipotle. Which is quite impressive considering both the distance and their desire to make a profit. 

I do also find it amazing that on ordering a sandwich you can get free avocado spread, but guacamole costs $2 in a burrito. I assume this must be due to the immense costs of the differing tools required in application. I might suggest trying to use the same spoon in the future? Just a thought.

Keep up the scam,

sometimes this randomly happens throughout the rest of the quarter, and each time, especially when it happens multiple times in the same day, is just as painful.
and when you try to join in, they treat you like a baldheaded cretin off rip, or they politely entertain your presence with a “yeah i’m gonna talk to my friend now”.
sometimes you’ll get a normal person to talk to, but in a class of 300-600, that’s gonna be like 3% of people.

13slm07,Reflection from a jaded senior (gatekeeping culture at UW),"because every facet of UW is competitive (major admissions, internships, jobs), most students gatekeep their resources and misrepresent their stats. I’ve often seen fellow students and even friends gatekeep their network, internships, resources. As a result, it’s extremely hard for someone without network to even know where to begin looking for internships and get their foot in the door. I especially feel this as a first gen immigrant, as my parents can only nod and smile when I tell them about school or my internship. As much as people don’t want to believe it or laugh at it, but privilege also comes from having well connected parents (or even parents who know about how the American society works). This is where I sound cynical, but it really is true when people joke that someone can make a call to their dad or their dads friend and get an internship. I saw a video where there is soft nepotism (or something along those lines), where young people benefit from having parents in the same industry as them. I see my peers having their hands held through the recruiting process because they have parents in that industry. 

looking back, I want to stress the importance of network to incoming students. resources are distributed widely in professional RSOs and frats/sororities (which also require quite competitive applications but that’s another can of worms) but tightly restricted within those social circles, so make sure you are leveraging these networks.

edit: this post exists to reflect on my experiences and offer a word of advice to younger students. yes, this was my dream school, but because of that I came in with rose tinted glass thinking that as long as I do well (get into a good major, get good grades, get into good clubs) I will be recognized by the real world and be rewarded with a good job. However, I was unaware of the fact that networking is such an important factor in addition to doing well academically, and sometimes even trumps academic achievement. For those that have had similar experiences, I feel seen and I am glad we can all recognize the bigger issue. Yet I want to make it clear that I am not looking for sympathy, but to offer perspectives that I wish someone would have told me coming into college. I write this post partially to also let younger students know that academic achievement isn’t all and it’s better to start building connections, especially if they didn’t realize that network is important or what networking even is (as I was when I started college). 

Secondly, I admit that yes, I perhaps could’ve done better and shot for the stars. I am not giving myself any excuses, as many in the comments think I am doing. This isn’t a pity party, and I am not blaming other hardworking people for “taking things away from me”. My criticism is on the system where some people who have low, no experience, etc, can get a job because their parents have connection.

Lastly, some comments seem to rely on confirmation bias when evaluating the information in this post. More dangerously, making assumptions in the name of “tough love”. Just because I shed light on some less-than-peachy aspects of uw does not mean I have no connections or relationships. I have a job, friends, and I am full of hope. I am simply recognizing the fact that to get here, it took me a lot of extra work.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/13slm07/reflection_from_a_jaded_senior_gatekeeping/,36,265

epu304,Daily Review: Mediterranean Bowl at Center Fable 43.8dB,"Dear HFS,

Sorry for my absence in feedback. I tried to return the day before yesterday, and have attached the previous texts below.

Today I was euphoric when I saw the beef chili on the menu, kind of Norman victory of 1066 happy. The beef chili is quite possibly the best HFS meal I've had this week. In fact it was out of stock, the best HFS meal I've had this week was in my dreams: my humble feedback would to please give me decent food so that the best meal I've had from you is not in fact fictitious.

Instead I resorted to the Mediterranean Bowl: one of my favourites. I choose to add the beef, I'm not an ethical man. The beef was good, the bowl had a lot of food which was warm: more than I normally get both in heat and quality. I reiterate my previous points: it's way too expensive.

Also what's up with the lack of lids on catering troughs. You know, the trays food is kept in the weird warm fridges, that have cling film on. Why the flip, don't they have lids? Would lids not be more economical, environmental, and utilitarianism. Or is this some kind of aesthetic that's been lost on me? Is there actually a HFS Shitsthetic that I'm too uncultured to get?

Keep up the scam,

Yours professionally

pitysl,Advice to my younger freshman self...,"...from future you, who's been on campus for less than 2 quarters

1. Please read up what panic attacks and anxiety looks like. Cause when you took only half an edible and freaked out, you could've saved money by not going to the hospital. General rule of thumb, don't do anything new drug wise by yourself 

2. I don't care how cute it was when your first date with that junior was watching ATLA, trust him when he says he doesn't want a relationship. You're only hurting by staying and he is definitely not changing for you lol

3. Make multiple friend groups. Not just that group of people on your floor who gush about Superbad. Because trust me if (actually when) that group falls apart you're going to feel like the whole world is ending. Make friends everywhere and you're going to be just fine

4. That best friend 3,000 miles away from you? Not worth staying in your room convincing her to video call when friends at your door are holding snacks and ice cream because they wanted to support you during that friend breakup. Sometimes you outgrow people from your past and that's ok. It just means you're getting closer to being the person you're meant to be 

5. Don't walk alone at night on the Ave and Greek Row. If that boy cared about you, he would've cared about your safety

6. Flick the bean in the morning. Don't care how horny you are because 2 seconds away from finishing you're going to accidently make eye contact with your roommate who also thought you were sleeping...

7. 4am at ode with friends and strangers is going to make you happier than that one frat party 

8. Stop taking school so serious and get out of your room. Trust yourself that the after class revision was enough 

9. Water and center table's scrambled eggs the next morning. Your keys are in the fridge btw

10. Ice in that drink! Don't grind on the guy dressed up as harry potter! Go with three friends if you anticipate going home with some other girl!

10. Actually no take your studies seriously. After that first midterm, midterm season doesn't stop until 2 weeks before the end of quarter. Get back on that smh

11. Just know no matter what you did your best. You aren't perfect and no one is. Even that girl who seems to have everything (4.0 in CSE, a bf, perfect outfits, perfect body, etc.) Focus on doing YOUR best.

12. Stop taking everything so goddamn personal. You aren't the moon kissing the night sky. You have to sing Under the Sea with all your heart. You have to shovel Cheerios 2 mins before your 8:30 because you know you aren't going to function later. You have to pause for a minute and just admire those corgis. You have to stop spending hours after a test figuring out your grade and then your back up major. You've got to stop trying to make your neighbors like you. Fuck it kid. You've got to love yourself.

13. I'm proud of you even if mom doesn't tell you. Your value doesnt go down when she yells at you for not carrying your tracker (sorry I mean cellular device) everywhere. You aren't a whore

14. That guy from madrona? That girl from calc? Those people you randomly met? I can't wait for you to get to know them because you're going to find so much love. Open your heart to then and watch how you heal in a healthy environment. You deserve this

15. Be boundless even if the campaign ends next year",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/pitysl/advice_to_my_younger_freshman_self/,4,258

""2:30,"" I replied. So I went to my Marine Bio class at 9:30 then used the time after to study for the Bio exam. In my mind, I still thought it was 2:30... But at exactly 1:35, I checked my phone to see my calendar for the quarter, which was the lock screen... and then... my heart dropped. My exam was at 1:30. I thought I might as well drop and take it again next quarter. But then I didn't give up... I grabbed my wallet, keys, and backpack and DASHED towards the door, PRESSED the elevator button... and waited like Thanos. I got in there, PRESSED floor 3, got out, RAN out the door, RAN through the Quad and then stopped to walk because I'm not athletic, then RAN again. Got to the front, my TA and John Parks directed me towards the back and proceeded to hand me the Exam... I wrote like a MAD MAN, like I'd never written before, wrote like Stephen King if he took Adderall. I will never forget this experience. Now I know what people are saying about PTSD after college for being late to exams. But one thing Dawgs... in the words of JOHN CENA... NEVER GIVE UP!

si6lsl,District Market out of Red Bulls,"I started college a devoted connoisseur of tea. A caffeine boost for me meant going crazy with some Earl Grey instead of my usual green tea. But soon the stress of weed-out classes and part time work at a fast food restaurant piled on to me. Simply put, I was exhausted. Around early November I was finally lured across the border into coffee consumption like a waterfront seagull is baited by an Ivar's french fry. This was my gateway drug. What started as one cup before my Math 125 lecture soon became three per day. Then four. Then five. As I integrated my way into finals season, I once again found myself drudging my way through the day in a cloudy stupor of apathy and mental exhaustion. I needed something new. 

With over $500 still left on my dining account, I stumbled into the District Market one Saturday morning looking for something absurd to buy in bulk. I considered potatoes and condoms, but soon realized both would sit around unused on the floor of my dorm, a stark reminder of my shortcomings this quarter. But then I saw them. Shiny metal cylinders, glistening erotically under the florescent lighting of the DM - their red, white and blue logo filling me with a patriotic romanticism I hadn't felt since Jay Inslee secured his third term as governor. I needed them. I needed them all.

Frantically filling a basket with as many as I could carry, I paraded my Red Bull bounty to the cashier with a new-found optimism. I was going to make it through the quarter.

As finals came and went, I jittered and twitched through my days with ease. While occasionally the DM would run out of my fix, I had a large enough stockpile under my bed to give me an illusion of sustainability. Simply put, I thought I was invincible. And I got complacent. Over the last few weeks, I decided to dip into my surplus, put off a restock until after midterms. Two days ago I found myself with only 10 Bulls to my name. I quickly marched over to the District Market for a resupply mission. Upon entering, my stomach folded itself into a klein bottle. The entire shelf was empty. 

In desperation, I returned yesterday. Nothing. And again this morning. Nothing. I sit here now sipping my very last Red Bull and typing this short rant out of desperation. But also as a warning to my fellow Huskies. Please help.",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/si6lsl/district_market_out_of_red_bulls/,24,254

These endorsements were grounded in general opinions and attitudes. 

Is this really worth our time to gripe about, this circle jerk of apologies? Slippery slope my boundless boys.

• when your professor makes an attempt at a joke and the whole class chuckles just to make them feel better about how bad the joke was
• if it is quiet outside you can hear birds chirping!!!
• if it isn’t cloudy like 30 minutes before sunset the world is blessed with a nice golden hue!! it looks so nice reflecting off windows and buildings!
• a nice warm cup of coffee
• drawing pictures, no matter how bad
• pictures of frogs!
• pictures of fat cats!
• melty toasty sandwiches
• putting in headphones and doing a lil dance while you walk to class even though only you know what you’re dancing to
• sitting by a radiator and feeling ~toasty~
• smiling at people on busses and when i’m walking to class! i might look silly but then people are awkwardly forced to smile back and then they might keep at it!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/e1r4rg/a_list_of_happy_things/,21,253

nb29b8,Get Ben Wiggins a Permanent Position at the Dept. of Biology,"Hi Guys,

I'm a graduating senior here at the UW graduating from Biochemistry. Some of you may know or have taken intro biology from Ben Wiggins. If you have you have seen how amazing this man is at teaching and the positive impact he leaves on freshmen every year. This quarter is unfortunately his last quarter. It has come to my attention that Ben is not a professor here and is hired as ""staff that teaches"". This means Ben works as administrative staff and only fills teaching positions when there are not enough people to teach. Unfortunately the Bio department does not plan to give him a full professor position to him and therefore he is not guaranteed for any new instructing opportunities. He has told me that this quarter is his last quarter teaching. Ben is the only instructor I have had the pleasure of learning from who actively incorporates the issues of equity in life, science, and stem into his lectures. He makes everyone feel welcome and he inspires students to become scientists.

 I am asking that if you find you care about this, that you please send a letter to the chair of biology and the associate chair of biology letting them know of your feelings. Additionally, you can make an impact by just giving him the rate my professor you've been meaning to but forgot about. STEM needs work to be better for it's students and accessible to everyone and if we lose Ben we will be losing one of our best workers here at UW.

Emails are: Chair of Biology David Perkel: [perkel@uw.edu](mailto:perkel@uw.edu)

Associate Chair of Undergraduate Biology Jennifer Ruesink: [ruesink@uw.edu](mailto:ruesink@uw.edu)

Edit: Ben himself told me this information and when I asked how to help this is what he told me. He may be teaching this summer I'm not sure perhaps he meant this is his last year. Yes he is in administration like I said, staff that teaches. However, he will be leaving teaching and looking elsewhere because there are no open positions. The point is that Ben would teach as his sole job if he could be he is not being given that position.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/nb29b8/get_ben_wiggins_a_permanent_position_at_the_dept/,16,250

12umeei,This sub desperately needs to restrict certain posts to topic-specific mega threads,"I feel like 50% of this sub is just posts asking the sliiiightest iterations of the same few questions, those questions being:

1. Will I get accepted?
2. What are my chances of getting accepted?
3. Will my offer get rescinded?
4. Is (some area around UW) safe?

The answers are the same most of the time, and it seems like people don’t look at previously asked questions before posting. I know it’s kind of a petty complaint, but it’s annoying as hell! I feel like this sub would benefit from posts with those questions not being allowed outside a specific megathread. That way people are also forced to see other peoples questions and the answers they’ve gotten and might not even need to post their question after all. 

Anyway, if that doesn’t happen and you have one of the questions above, here are the formal answers 

1. Maybe!
2. The acceptance rate of the school!
3. Probably not! Unless you murdered someone or didn’t actually graduate highschool or something, and if that’s the case, you have a bigger problem on your hands!
4. Nowhere in Seattle is safe because I am here and I will track you down and steal all your electronics so there’s one less person asking these questions!

178jkym,A suggestion to people considering UW (and any other schools with a city campus),"Do not be surprised when the city is a city!!!

The vast majority of safety-related posts on this sub boil down to “why is the city like a city, don’t they know STUDENTS live here?” or “how can I go to school in the city without confronting anything that is different from suburbia?” and I have to say, it’s really goofy. I understand that safety is important, but next to none of the questions asked need to be answered with any more nuance than “carry mace and be aware of your surroundings.” I’m not saying you can’t feel unsafe, but college is all about growing up and learning about the world, which often includes encountering things that aren’t comfortable or familiar, and posting asking if you’re gonna get murdered on the ave past 8pm or something like that is not going to help you in the long run. There are countless schools in small cozy college towns that are equally, if not more, academically rigorous than UW. With all those options out there, going to a school in the city is very much a choice, and it’s important to recognize a major city is a major city. You’ll be hard pressed to find one in the United States that doesn’t have the qualities that make people feel unsafe.

I know some people always have beef with this sort of take, but regardless on your opinion of how a city should be governed/policed/whatever, the current state of our city and all other major cities in the United States is reality. Carry your mace, keep an eye on your surroundings, and if you’re someone more vulnerable for whatever reason, try and have a buddy with you if you’re out late at night. If you want to challenge yourself, maybe even make eye contact with a homeless person and give them a nod instead of pretending they don’t exist; contrary to popular belief, most of them will not cannibalize you on the spot if you do so!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/178jkym/a_suggestion_to_people_considering_uw_and_any/,27,247
qkwas4,PSA: You should know what violates FERPA rules,"I recently took a midterm where they required us to write our name and student ID number on every page. ""Ok, if something gets separated, this makes sense as there will be no question about whose paper it is,"" I was thinking as I was starting my midterm.   
When we get them back a few days later, our exams were ripped into multiple sections and **left out in piles for the entire class to go through.** The next section walked in after our class and started going through the piles, too. **Our names in conjunction with our grades and student ID numbers (both of which are by definition educational records and therefore protected) were out and available for anyone to see.**   


You guys, ***this is a blatant violation of FERPA****.* Our grades are personal educational records. If I choose to flip through an exam with all my grades on it in view of everyone, that's my choice. If I want to keep my grades hidden and only look at them in a locked, windowless closet, that's my choice too. Having grades in a pile with identifiable information attached to them *takes away this right that we have as students*.   


[Here](http://courses.washington.edu/registr/FERPA_Faculty_Staff/FERPA_Handout.pdf) is a PDF that outlines some of this. It was written in 2011 but have FERPA requirements loosened since then? No. They haven't. 

[This link](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/ferpa/) says that ""**Public posting** of grades either by the student’s name, student number, or social security number without the student’s written permission is a violation of FERPA.""

WSU has a statement in [this link](http://ferpa.em.wsu.edu/faqs/) that directly states that handing back graded work like this is a violation. (Under Staff and 'How should I return graded work?' there is a statement that says, ""Distributing graded work in a way that exposes the student’s identity or leaving personally identifiable graded papers unattended is no different from posting grade publicly."")

  
**IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED IN ONE OF YOUR CLASSES:**   
Please follow [this link](https://privacy.uw.edu/report/), and report it! We have rights as students, and being able to call out our university for violating FERPA is one of them. We also have a right to report UW *directly to the Department of Education.* [This](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=478-140-080) shows that right, as well as [this one](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/). 

[This page](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/) (same link as the immediate last one) has a FERPA training for students (it's a 10 minute video and a short quiz) if you want more information.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/qkwas4/psa_you_should_know_what_violates_ferpa_rules/,60,247

1bni061,I went to and reviewed all the local Boba options,"The amount of Boba in the University District is absurd. No drug stores on the ave, frozen yogurt is gone, but over 20 places where you can get boba. My natural inquiry was ""Why do these all exist? Are there any significant differences between them?"" Over the years I've tried a number of them, but over the last two quarters I've slowly been making an effort to try every single one and tracked how I thought about them in a spreadsheet :P

My strategy was to order each place's black milk tea with tapioca as a default baseline. This doesn't cover other types of tea like green tea, fruit tea, or any unique flavors that might make a place stand out, so if any of you have specific recommendations for these please let me know! I may expand/adjust my spreadsheet over time as I try more from these places, hence why I'm sending a link instead of a screenshot.

Tastes will be subjective and you may not agree with my reviews, and I am not claiming to be a boba expert by any means.

14hzmzk,Help finding owner of dog who bit my friend around Friday 5:10pm at Montlake grass area,"My friend filed the following to the Regional Animal Services of King County [(RASKC)](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/regional-animal-services/animal-control-response.aspx#:~:text=Fill%20out%20the%20animal%20complaint,S%2C%20Kent%2C%20WA%2098032) (the ID of the submission is PP-37645). We are currently looking for the owner of the pitbull.

If anyone has any idea who they might be, feel free to send me a DM. If not, **please upvote** this so we can get as many eyes on this as possible. He ended up going to the UW Hospital ER yesterday to get treatment.

&#x200B;

>""I was at the University of Washington Montlake Cut grass area around 5:10pm. (west side of the bridge, north side of the cut near the UW hospital). I was looking at the pitbull for like 10-15 seconds. I was simply looking and smiling, nothing more. When I turned my back towards the dog, the dog lunged at my leg and bit my left calf. I got away from the dog by running away and the dog's owner pulled the dog back. After the bite, the dog also attempted to attack my girlfriend when she tried to get the owner's information.  
>  
>We could not get the owner's information after being discouraged when my girlfriend almost got attacked by the dog. The owner was an Asian female in her early 20s or late teens, she seemed to be around 5 foot 4, 5 foot 5. My guess is she is also a UW student.""

Edit: The dog is fully grown (not a pup) and is black/dark brown.

1158rnq,TA quoted Andrew Tate,"My TA quoted Andrew Tate last class and from the beginning he has preferred asking male students for their insights. we thought this was just a coincidence since females participated less too. last class, he yelled at me and another female student for kindly asking him for an explanation to a class problem. then he said he cannot help us-it was weird to say the least. Anywhere we can report these actions? Are there any anonymous places too? I know i made a post previously about another issue but felt the need to take that down due to personal info.

it sucks being a female in predominantly white male dominated spaces. thanks.

e6ske8,Daily Review: BBQ Beef Marinara 80.3dB,"Dear HFS,

How've you been?

I got the pasta special, I wouldn't describe it as special nor pasta. I can only assume you'd intended to make a Bolognese, accidentally snorted an entire jar of paprika: and found nowhere else to spew.

For $7.49 instead of buying overcooked pasta with a sauce that could only be described as disappointing even if I had got it from a discount dented tin can, I could have walked to Dominos. Got a pizza, and have enough change to buy an overpriced bowl of cereal tomorrow morning after undoubtedly having a horrid case of the shits.

I could have got the potato curry again. However I decided to take one for the team, and provide a variety in my feedback for y'all. I would love it if I was able to provide a quality range of feedback by eating cheap decent meals, like the tolerable potato curry yesterday.

For reference a medium sized truck makes 80.3dB. After finishing my meal I said ""HFS is a scam"" at 80.3db.

Love you lots,

Keep up the scam,

Yours professionally,

As I was walking down the steps, savoring the taste of my almond croissant from trader joe's, I made direct eye contact with a white feathered menace. 

The seagull stepped in front of me, eyeing my delectable breakfast that I was yet to finish. The fog curled around us, and I keenly felt the crisp morning air as I briskly walked away from the seagull, hoping to avoid the bird at all costs. 

To my great alarm, I saw a flash of movement out of the corner of my eye, and the seagull appeared on my left, having followed me past kane hall. I frantically tossed my half eaten croissant to the seagull. 

I am a pathetic coward. But even more so, the seagulls on this campus are degenerates.

iz5ndv,KiwiLink - a brand new UW study buddy finder app - free on iOS and Android - made BY UW students FOR UW students - great new way to make friends in a time of quarantine,"If you’re anything like me, you suck at finding study buddies and you STRUGGLE with making meaningful connections at the University of Washington lemao. Now that COVID19 is a thing, antisocial-academia is even MORE of a problem, as we find ourselves indefinitely isolated lol. We are BOUNDED BOIZ.

Along with around 15 other engineers and designers, I decided to tackle this issue of antisocial-academia this summer. After months of grinding, I’m proud to announce that our work has finally resulted in some pay-off (lol).

Today, I’m excited to introduce KiwiLink - the ultimate UW study buddy finder app! Download it for free on iOS and Android today. 

KiwiLink is super easy to use. Create an account, select your classes and majors, and BOOM! Our special algorithm will automatically introduce you to relevant study buddies in the “For You” page. Swipe right to add these people as KiwiLink friends, and then you can chat with them and make study groups with them! And who knows… Perhaps you’ll find a special someone who’s MORE than just a study buddy xd

But yuh. If you want to find some new UW friends to study with or chat with (or more), download KiwiLink today! It’s free and it’s available on both iOS and Android. We’ve been tirelessly working on this project for a couple of months, so we really hope that people make good use of our app.

h8kza0,To everyone who was skipped at graduation,"I'm so fucking proud of you!!!!!!!

Despite covid, despite online classes, despite social ills impacting us right now, you've made a remarkable accomplishment despite 4 years of anxieties, frustrations, and challenges.

However you've also had 4 years of hopefully good memories, laughs, and accomplishments. Nothing will ever change the fact that you've accomplished so much!

To those who were omitted and feel alone...

You're not alone. I was the only person from my former high school (16 of us were graduating) who was mentioned at graduation this year, and even then, not where I was supposed to be. 

I was College of Arts and Sciences. For some reason, I was put with the random stragglers after the College of Social Work. I know that an online graduation is tough, but the 6 minutes where I felt embarrassed and angry that my name wasn't mentioned, at least when I still thought I was omitted? I can only imagine how everyone else feels, who weren't even misplaced as much as they were omitted. 

If we're still being told to have a weak cop out by joining the C/O '21, I'd hope that the Office of Ceremonies/UW at least try to do something to compensate. For many of us, this was one of the most important events of our lives thus far, and for others, a moment of pride. Through UW's and their contractor's gross incompetence, many people have felt hurt in times already tough.

To any graduates now, who were missed, I see you, and I'm so proud of you all for your achievements. Please, take your objective accomplishment, and continue to work for yourself and in making this world a better place.

I'm genuinely so proud of you all, and whilst employment, and life in general are far from ideal right now, tough times breed tough people, and tough people breed good times. As the cycle of life continues, know that as we continue, in our individual and societal pursuits, that we can and will build a future regardless of this one day, and this one year.

Congratulations to the Class of 2020! I wish you all the best.

P.S. In the event that the Office of Ceremonies/UW does nothing to compensate and celebrate those missed, is there something that we as students, and now alumni, can do to make things feel better?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/h8kza0/to_everyone_who_was_skipped_at_graduation/,8,244

You guys are amazing for keeping your composure. I'm a UWT student in the IT major and I hope to have you guys again.



Professor Goda, the head of the major, caught a cheater during our jeopardy quiz. The mood completely changed from there on but he still was willing to give the class extra credit for the top 5 groups. You genuinely made waking up at 8:45 enjoyable. You interacted with your class like it was a late night discord call with the homies. I don't think I've laughed this much in class ever.

grpg1t,Korean restaurant ranking in U-district from poor Korean international student,"&#x200B;

Why Korean food so expensive around U district? 

Here's ranking

3: Korean Tofu House

\- This place is alright, recently remodeled. but sometimes they piss me off that they're kind of half-assing the banchan(side dishes) and sometimes cooks seem like they never had Korean food before. It's on and off on some days. Very Americanized Korean food though and ramen for 8 dollars? go to h mart across the street and buy yourself 10 ramens. 

2: Cafe on the ave

\- Known as a cafe but surprisingly good Korean food. Affordable and a lot of food.

1: The Alley

\- If you don't know what 'ajumma' hospitality is. You'll learn if you go to this place. I think this place is the closest thing to restaurant-grade food in Korea. 

&#x200B;

Honorable mentions:

Green House

That nightclub (buffet is not bad)

Ninja sushi queen backflip 360 quick scope

&#x200B;

Places that are way overpriced because they're selling the 'experience'(almost Portage bay of Korean food) imo:

1afn6sz,The “what are my chances” posts are getting out of hand,"I’ve been browsing this subreddit occasionally and every time I come on here, it seems that at least 1/3rd of the posts are people asking about their admissions chances. Most university subreddits don’t allow posts like this, and instead make megathreads for admissions questions for obvious reasons. There’s also other subreddits like r/chanceme that are completely devoted to these kinds of questions.

I completely understand just wanting to feel a little certainty, and I remember how anxious waiting for a decision can be. But the truth is that none of us are able to read your GPA and SAT off a reddit post and then accurately tell you whether you’ll be admitted or not. The admissions criteria is holistic and often pretty unclear, and even if you think you have no shot, it can’t hurt to apply and see.

If the moderators are at all active here, they should take some steps to stop the influx of these posts.",Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1afn6sz/the_what_are_my_chances_posts_are_getting_out_of/,9,233

qyh9sm,PSA for those living in campus housing,"Last year I was living in the dorms in Lander, I had stayed here for both thanksgiving and Christmas because of covid. On Christmas Day last year, while I was in my room just on my phone being quiet whatever assumed vacant, got my doorknob rattled on and someone trying to get into my room. My friend and I were obviously pissing our pants at this points, I live in a single, and we weren’t going to confront this person head on but I did go to the door and look at the peephole. I saw a person turned back to me at the door across doing the same thing and did it to numerous other doors, I immediately called uwpd but the person was gone already by the time they got there. I lived on 4th floor at the time and my friend who lived on 7th returned to their room to check if everything was okay to see their door wide open, nothing was taken because there was no cash or anything, there was even a really expensive gaming laptop of the friends roommate in there untouched so I don’t think people will necessarily take items as much as they are looking for cash, doesn’t mean someone won’t though. So, if you are leaving for the holidays either thanksgiving or Christmas, be very aware and lock your door every time you are in and out of your room, excellent to practice in general, I know the doors lock on their own when you shut them. But my guess is the person had a card or something to wedge in between the door to open it, if your door is locked you have nothing to worry about. Don’t let the residential grinch steal your stuff stay safe out there 🙏",PSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/qyh9sm/psa_for_those_living_in_campus_housing/,2,228

We are half way done with this quarter and we will have much needed (and deserved) break before fall quarter. I know it is hard to study when it is really nice outside, but you should be proud of yourself to study in this weird time. Treat yourself today, whatever that means to you, set a goal for homework and reading and then treat yourself. You need it and deserve it. You are studying and learning all year and that is something to be proud of. Do not forget to drink water, go on a walk or a bike ride, do whatever pleases you and distresses you from school. It is okay to take a break and listen to your body and mind. Meditate and appreciate yourself. You got this.

13l70r8,Open Letter To Boba Up Employees,"I saw a poster on Tuesday morning saying that BobaUp employers were stealing employee tips. This poster has since been taken down and the original poster didn't have anything on it about how to get in contact with people or if there was any organizing to combat this practice. I just wanted to let those employees know that under Washington State Law:

* Employers must pay all tips to employees.
* The employer may not take tips for company use, or to pay employee wages.
* “Tip crediting” isn’t allowed. Tips are **in addition to**, and not a part of, an employee’s state hourly minimum wage.

[https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges](https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges)

I know a lot of workers especially in the service industry worry that it is a losing battle when it comes to standing up for their labor violations, so I wanted to link some resources to ways that employees can enforce their rights:

1. You can get free legal council about your situation with the king county bar association. This will probably be low on the priority list, but they will get to you and it is FREE. I did this myself about a workplace violation and while I have to hire an attorney for the actual lawsuit, it is good to have free legal council to see if proceeding with legal action is a good idea (link to free legal assistance [https://www.kcba.org/?pg=Free-Legal-Assistance](https://www.kcba.org/?pg=Free-Legal-Assistance) )
2. Make sure to document as much as you can in writing. When you have a spoken conversation with your employer saying this stuff about your wages, email them a followup confirming what had been discussed in the meeting so you have a paper trail. Often recording this is enough to scare them straight
3. Talk to your coworkers about your situation and see if you can form a united front. Employers talk a lot about how your labor is replaceable, but honestly it is costly to fire a bunch of people legally, let alone illegally, and then hire a bunch of new inexperienced people. There are ways that you can organize in order to collectively bargain for good treatment. Just because a company is a small business that does not mean that you should accept unethical and illegal treatment from your employer.",PSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/13l70r8/open_letter_to_boba_up_employees/,23,228
xdrwqg,I hate HFS and they are an embarrassment to this university.,"I drive all the way to the UW to move into my dorm. My email from HFS says Lander Desk closes at 10 PM through this week and I am good to grab my keys from them at anytime until the school year starts. Google Maps also says they close at 10 PM. The HFS website even says they close at 9 PM. I arrive at 7:40 PM. I *should* have plenty of time. I walk in. The gate around Lander Desk is closed. But the desk is still fully staffed with 4-5 people working about. I ask them if they can help me. They say ""No, they are closing at 7 PM for this week.""

I call the RA on call. They say that they can't help me because they can't verify my identity, but I should be able to go to Lander Desk. I tell them the desk is closed. The RA says they will pull some strings and call me back in 5 minutes. 20 minutes goes by. No call. I decided to go home. I get home 40 minutes later. I finally get a call back from them. I hate HFS
