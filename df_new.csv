I live in Hansee and I have since about winter quarter and my skin has not been this bad since I was a freshman in high school. It was fine when I lived in the new dorms, so it’s definitely not a change in habits. While my dorm seems pretty mold free the bathrooms seem to be covered in it, particularly the showers. 

These showers seem like they are never properly washed or maintained, there is a whole in the floor of one of them that has just become one large crevasse of black mold.

Is this just my wing/floor or does anyone else who lives in Hansee experience this? Is this an issue that can be fixed? Anyone else have any moldy Hansee experiences? ",Student Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1c78tmk/mold_in_hansee/,6,22

1c6wmvb,"The Bakery, thoughts?","My freshman year there were so many more houses that hosted shows and I used to really enjoy going to them. But, now it seems like the bakery is really the only one and SO MANY people go. I find it so stressful and can't help but worry something bad might happen.  

Also, I personally feel like the vibes of shows has changed. They use to all be about inclusivity and being yourself and I use to have a lot of fun at them and enjoyed talking to people, but I feel like the last couple times I've gone to the bakery I have felt very unwelcomed and like no one wants to talk to me. One clear thing I have noticed is people dress up way more for the shows, I feel like I can't just wear what I wore to class that day anymore. I have to put on some elaborate trend setting outfit with cool eyeliner just for people to not cut me i the bathroom line. I understand self expression, but its gotten to a point where it feels like I have to perform and present a certain way just to attend. Honestly it feels like I'm back in high school except in high school I was too queer for the cool kids and now I feel like I don't present queer enough, but now all the cool kids are bi in a het relationship and don't like the word lesbian because it ""sounds too harsh"".

I haven't attended one in a while though, is this still the vibe? Does it still get PACKED? and idk maybe because it 420 and there's no theme it might not be as intense.  My friends and I are thinking or going, but also seriously not because this is an experience we've all felt. have people had good experiences there as of lately? What type of people have been attending? Part of me also thinks maybe its because I am not a freshman anymore, I know non freshman go, but I also know ALOT of freshman do attend and maybe only want to talk to other freshman.

1c4f23e,How does the major system work?,"Hello everyone!

I am an international student and was directly admitted to Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences this application cycle. I was wondering about how the major system worked since UW is one of my top choices at the moment. From my understanding, I would have to list a few engineering majors (3?) if I wanted to apply to the College of Engineering, right? Say, I put Chemical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Electrical Engineering as my top choices. If I was admitted to one of those and not the other two, would I automatically become my admitted major? Or do I get the choice to keep my original dtc major? Also, in case I get accepted to all three engineering majors (if that’s possible), do I get to choose?

I don't know how to deal with it and I feel like I genuinely would be uncapable of taking a class with one of the people I had a falling out with.

So when I was done with CC, I looked and realized I could only apply to get a degree that had no prerequisites. Even English had a LONG list of prerequisite classes I had never taken. I'm pretty stupid for not preparing. I also don't intend to waste more money on taking those prerequisites at the cc, I am not in the financial position to do that and then wait another year for admission at UW. 

For a little context I will be a lawyer, and I just knew I would take a major that was focused in humanities and arts and then head out to law school. So I chose classics(as a transfer) and will start this year. 

So now I'm curious on what to expect for this major. I love history and reading so I'm not worried I won't like it, but I wonder, what type of people take these classes? it was clearly not my intended major and I don't know anyone that's taken a major like this, it's even more ""out there"" than Philosophy.

I applied for this admission cycle and was directly admitted to Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences. Given the relatively early deadline of UW, I was not completely sure of my major at the time although I was sure it was going to be either Chemistry or Chemical Engineering. So I applied as a Chemistry major without giving it much thought, but I decided I was going to pursue engineering a while after I applied to UW. Now that I am accepted and UW actually it’s one of my top choices, I realize that I should’ve applied as an engineering major if I wanted to pursue ChemE. Hence my questions are, can direct admits change their major after enrolling? If so, how difficult would be for me to change my major from Chemistry to ChemE? And how competitive is it to get directly admitted to Chemistry? I am an international student, if it’s a factor.

My goal is to go into quantitative finance (researcher/trader) or work at a startup. This means I will likely do a math double major/minor along with perhaps pursuing graduate school in CS or Math. The cost difference between UW compared to UIUC and UMich is about 20k/year after scholarships and other stuff is included (have not gotten finaid package back so could be less than 20k).

I like UW but the problem is ik alot of ppl from UW and they mostly go into SWE and FAANG/big company jobs (based on linkedin and talking to many UW ppl) which is not something I’m interested in. UIUC has more finance recruiters and proximity to Chicago for finance and UMich has Ross school of business (I could minor here) which attracts finance people. For UIUC I could also switch to CS + Math or + Physics since they offer those programs in undergrad + I like the school a lot too.

I am not quite sure about the startup scene throughout these schools since none of them are near bay area.

If I choose to go to UIUC or Umich I WILL NOT be taking loans or going into debt due to my grandparents. Please help me choose whether the UIUC/Umich is worth it especially for someone who wants to work in finance/startups.

I was wondering if doing them again over the summer at a CC before the fall quarter at UW is possible? It would be a great way to boost my GPA when trying to get admitted to CS.

If the summer quarter option isn't possible,  how would taking Calc 2 and Phys 1 in my first quarter at UW look in the admission process? I would take INFO 200 along with it to finish off the Informatics prerequisites.

If anyone has tried going either route can you let me know how it went? Would they look desperate/ knock me some points in the CS admission process?

1bzciqi,Idea: Be nice to the people you want to convince,"EDIT: I am making the exact same mistake, the title is ironically a lesson I should listen to. The original post was a cathartic angry release and it was more about me feeling better than addressing the audience (""HUB vandals"", etc). 

Especially w/Gaza war and killing, it's too much death to wrap your head around and I think that it is probably unleashing shock/defensiveness/cognitive dissonance worldwide. I got in my own way by just indulging in being pissed and I respectfully do believe vandals did as well.

It is much easier to cross the bridge and change your mind (political opinion, etc) when the other person is inviting you in with open arms. I have been in the situation of needing to change before and you can psychologically feel the difference between when ""agreeing"" is framed as ""defeat"" and when it's ""joining your friends to do the right thing"".

I know that it is possible to get ourselves out of the way (vandals, reactionaries, me yapping and malding etc) and keep keep keep telling the people we know about all the bombing and killing in Gaza. It should be impossible to ignore.

This is exactly why I was writing about ""being careful about how we do it"". I think that it's important to be measured in your activism because you can appeal to people's emotions, beliefs etc without inviting pride, defensiveness, ego etc to the door.

This is one of those massively important and sickening historical events, and as a consequence it is so easy to frame as something to get on board with rather than using shame or force. We are very lucky to not have to use force in our situation.

I believe you (vandals) are righteous motherfuckers... you make me think about how much I'm willing to be uncomfortable... AND I think the expression of that has impacts; you can certainly see them below.

ORIGINAL POST:

This is addressed to ""the HUB vandals"", to distinguish between those who were trying to show the world the horrible truth about Gaza, and those who were ideologically masturbating with Sharpies.

Israel's reputation thrives off being known as the ""orderly security force"", as opposed to the ""frothing radical Palestinian terrorists"". This is a lie. Regardless, western media, American politicians, and the public are looking closely for examples.

This is an unfair box to be put in. You cannot be complacent sign-holders, and at the same time, you cannot be window-breakers. Civil disobedience is the remedy, this is a PERFECT opportunity for a sit-in. The cause needs the attention.

You can really tell how much someone gives a shit by how much they're willing to decenter themselves. And it seems that some of you really hate your audience. Yelling at reporters, slinging slurs, etc. Openly harassing anyone who came to PUBLICIZE YOUR DEMONSTRATION. (The goal)

When directly offered media attention... by the THE STATE-SPONSORED UNIVERSITY NEWSPAPER... which was going to show up, and has the largest audience... you cut off your nose to spite your face, and decided the Daily was ""too liberal"". And now the people you yelled at have a statement out about how much you yelled at them.

The vandalism is the perfect example. You could have covered the HUB wall to wall in flyers, communicated just as well, and then you would have had plenty of photos of UW staff taking them down. The cause gets the attention for longer, the administration has less to slander you with. You GAIN ATTENTION and SYMPATHY (support. for the cause. remember the cause?) at the cost of IMMEDIATE CATHARTIC RELEASE.

These choices were clearly made to show that ""the movement"" would not be moderated or constrained by authority. These are choices of ideological purists, tribalist book-thumpers, self-interested folks.

Have you noticed how protestors in worse circumstances-- PALESTINIANS, FOR EXAMPLE-- seem to be chiefly interested in impact, effect, and visibility? There is no armed struggle to wage on Red Square, so surely you are responsible for crafting the most-heard protest, not the most-strong.

There is NO EITHER-OR CHOICE between ""caring about optics"" and ""denouncing civilian carpet-bombing"", actually, and Lenin's spirit is not judging you from the sky. 

How can you so desperately want power and refuse to level with your audience? 1960s revolutionaries knew how to strategize to defeat the Western media machine, you guys just seem to know how to get mad. To those stubborn leftists who are putting themselves before their cause, I hope you are ignored in the public square for as long as you can't figure out how to accept what you can't control. 

(If you are unfamiliar with the killing in Gaza, you ought not to be hated for it, and you are welcome under the umbrella of protecting innocent life. The Wikipedia page for the ""Israel–Hamas war"", while Westernized, is a much better picture of the situation than what American news media will promote)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bzciqi/idea_be_nice_to_the_people_you_want_to_convince/,7,40

1bxunar,Petition to have a student referendum on the termination of students/groups responsible for the vandalism of the Husky Union Building (HUB),"Obviously, the vandalism inside the HUB is like poking the bear, but going after student artwork? Why are you dragging students who took the time to make those pieces of artwork and throwing them into the fire? You may outnumber the administration, but by triggering a chain reaction of friends of students who made those artworks, leading to more friends, you will be the one outnumbered in the end. 

Here's my reasoning for this referendum. I will address the elephant in the room: the group SUPER UW.

The student referendum. Unlike the elephant, it's the best chance we can end this without any violence. If the majority of current students want them responsible for the student referendum, the university administration will take action. I mean, who wouldn't do that under the banner of 'the majority of our students want us to take action against this vandalism'? 

Now, the group and its supporters may spin this student referendum as an abuse of power from the administration, but it's not really an abuse of power if they took action based on the statement that 'the majority of our students want us to take action against this vandalism.' Don't you love democracy? 

Another spin would be that the administration is silencing the minority of students in their university. This would be an amazing argument...if you didn't have your supporters vandalize literally anything in the HUB. 

We all know that they are the ones organizing these protests—the one that started from the Quad at 6 p.m. on Friday and stayed at the HUB overnight. Here is their official post from their Instagram. 

super\_uw: We’ve begun an overnight sit-in in the HUB. We are in firm solidarity with Palestinians facing genocide, demanding that UW materially and academically divest from Israel, cut all ties with Boeing, and end the anti-Palestinian repression of students, workers, and faculty.

Join us tonight at the HUB until International Quds Day. 

The vandalism happened when they did the sit-in inside the HUB overnight. The vandalism happened during the sit-in inside the HUB overnight. The vandalism inside the HUB is plastered with their motives. 

You don't have to be rocket scientists to combine two and two. 

The group, SUPER UW, should take responsibility for this matter, as they were in the closest proximity to the vandalism. Yet, they haven't. They believe that this was a peaceful protest, even though there were crimes against students and their artworks were subjected to vandalism, as none of the artworks were about the main issue. 

Another official statement: 

“Inside, dozens of students are preparing to take back our student union building as a place to express our collective power as people committed to Palestinian liberation and encampments free from Zionism,” a speaker from the United Front for Palestinian Liberation at UW said. “Several of these students are attaching themselves to a device called a lockbox which makes it almost impossible for them to be removed against their will.”  - TheDaily (University allows pro-Palestinian protesters to occupy HUB overnight)

Dozens of students? Did y'all vandalize dozens of students' artwork in the HUB? Ironic, isn't it? Except this time, everyone knows that the group and the individuals responsible for the vandalism will drag unrelated students into their own self-proclaimed goal. They proved that you would be collateral damage to their cause, whether you liked it or not. 

They did that with students' artwork inside the HUB, **UNRELATED TO THE PROTEST**. 

Who's next?

If they can get away with this without any repercussions, I bet they will do it again. 

And the next one will be even more crazier. Don't be surprised by their next one.

I've been cramming the classes I need to be finished with my first two years (currently taking CEE220, ME230, and PHYS123). After this, all I need is AMATH301 and AA260. My original plan was to do AA260 this summer and AMATH301 in the autumn. But I've recently been thinking about just taking both classes in the summer. The only downside is I won't be living here this summer and I'll have to commute to UW. I also just applied for my major through the capacity constrained route, so lots of this stuff is just up in the air for now. I was wondering if anyone else had recommendations for what classes I should take in the summer if I do get into my major. Starting in the autumn, I'll be set to take AA310, AA311, AA320 and the undergraduate seminar class. Do you think it would be too hard to take AMATH301 with all these classes?

-Do the units have Air Conditioning? I know many other student living buildings do. 

-Follow up to the last question: If no, are the windows compatible for air conditioners? Like those standalone units with the tube that goes to the window😅

-Are there rules regarding hanging stuff on the wall? I know I could check my lease but it’s so huge to go through😭🙏

-Can we have our own internet installed (Xfinity, Etc)? Can I bring my own wifi router to plug into the building wifi?

1bwq4vs,Uncomfortable spending at the District Market ,"so I’m a first year student living on west campus and I’ve been having real problems spending all of my dining money per quarter.

I use a cane as a mobility aid and have to get a basket if I pick up more than like 2 items—I constantly have people walk into me or avoid me because of my cane and the fact that I can’t walk normally like everyone else. it’s difficult for me to get the motivation/energy around my chronic pain and classes to go in the first place and I’m constantly really nervous and uncomfortable there.

Not only that but when I go, I go for my weekly groceries because it’s difficult to go every day—and the employees constantly comment on how much I am buying? But I have to, otherwise they won’t give me a bag and I have to struggle to get my groceries back to my dorm. One time, I brought my own bag and they rushed me to get out of there— so much so that while I was trying to put my groceries in my bag (one handed—again, it’s difficult to do things standing with my cane in the other hand supporting me), I dropped a thing of blueberries and had to pick them up by myself, crying and in pain, while another student shoved around me to check out where MY GROCERIES WERE STILL SITTING.

The north campus Dm is even worse, because they DO NOT even have baskets at all. Imagine if I was living there and just needed to get more than the two items I can carry in one arm!

Rant about how the DM treats students aside, I would love some advice on how to spend my dining money more effectively while combating my disabilities (mental and physical), pain, and social anxiety.

[edit/update: it's the end of the day and turns out a good lunch can really fix your attitude about things </3 thanks for the tips and kind words!!

i got into UW with a direct to college admission to engineering (I applied for HCDE and I guess this is the norm). a little nervous about the whole having to compete for a major. 
 
i also got into UCSD in their ICAM visual arts program. if i choose it, i plan to double major with ICAM and cogsci. 

on paper, both of them are so so similar, which is why im so stuck. im leaning towards UCSD while my family is leaning towards UW, they think the HCDE program is more employable. im an international student and the fees isn't enough of a difference to be a factor. please help me decide?

1bv58ns,UCSB vs UW Seattle,"I am stuck between UCSB vs UW Seattle. I got into UCSB for Pre-Economics & Accounting, and UW Seattle as a Direct Admit to the Foster School of business. I am a California Resident but cost isn't that much of an issue.

**School: UCSB Vs UW**

US News Rank: 35 Vs 40

Acceptance Rate: 29% Vs 46%

Total Cost Per Year: 40k Vs 60k (oos)

Location: Beach Town Vs Big City

Student-Faculty Ratio: 17:1 Vs 21:1

Overall, UCSB appears better in every meaningful statistic, however, the specific program is what I am more curious about. In 2023, UW Foster's starting salary for undergrads was 76.6k in 2023 with a 94% placement after 3 months, and the average signing bonus was 8.5k. This makes it significantly better than UW overall.

On the other hand, UCSB Pre-Economics & Accounting major has very little data available online and feels like a bit more of a gamble. Does anyone have any data on UCSB accounting major? I am leaning towards Foster since their MBA is ranked 20th on US news (which is still relevant to the undergraduate program) and since I have concrete data on outcomes. Some data on UCSB's accounting/econ program and any possible first-hand experience would be super helpful before making a decision.

Extra: I have also been waitlisted by Michigan and UCSD and was wondering how they would stack up in case I am offered a spot. I am also considering getting an MBA in the future and am not sure how that would impact my decision, I am assuming it won't but not I am not sure what MBA admissions are like.",Admissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bv58ns/ucsb_vs_uw_seattle/,8,0

Kelley pros-


1. Great placements + internship opportunities (placements records are public in a detailed manner, I like the transparency)

2. Prestige (t10 undergrad bschool)


Kelley cons-


1. Bloomington is really pretty but I'm afraid I'm a city girl

2. I wasn't impressed with the startup culture there (I went through their Accelerator website, pitching competition winners, company websites etc etc)

3. I've never lived in a snowy climate but I don't think I'll like it 


Udub pros-

1. LOVE the entrepreneurial culture in udub (very abundant) and in Seattle

2. Seattle ☀️🌊🤩


Udub cons


1. Health and biology heavy startups (A LOT of startups in udub are related to the medical field culminating in a strong medical startup community. I might have a hard time earning funding? )

2. Seattle 🔪🔫😨 (I live in a crime heavy city so ik the works but as an intl student, my parents would be stressed about me choosing seattle over a safe place like bloomington)

3. The placements records are very unspecific and I'm unsure whether foster could get me the internships which Kelley can. Avg salary of graduates is basically the same for both but foster graduates work in wa, ca, etc whereas Kelley graduates work in IL, IN, etx so the col varies by a lot.

**CWRU**

>**Pros:**  
\- fair grading  
\- small undergrad size (more individualized classes)  
\- great for pre-med (advising, resources, location, esp being so close to Cleveland Clinic ranked #1 in my prospective specialty)

He was very excited to apply to this program to get study intellectually stimulating curriculum. He thinks that school is boring and kiddish in what the teach 🙂

However he received an email today that he is *not* selected for the interview, which he is really sad about.

I am wondering if application to Robinson TS is really that competitive that even with this clear academic advancement, he could not get an interview, or is there something else going on? I am going to boost his confidence either way, but I guess it is disappointing that he didn’t get chance to present his side of the story to the interview panel.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bqciq8/robinson_transition_school_interview_rate/,17,8

My strategy was to order each place's black milk tea with tapioca as a default baseline. This doesn't cover other types of tea like green tea, fruit tea, or any unique flavors that might make a place stand out, so if any of you have specific recommendations for these please let me know! I may expand/adjust my spreadsheet over time as I try more from these places, hence why I'm sending a link instead of a screenshot.

Tastes will be subjective and you may not agree with my reviews, and I am not claiming to be a boba expert by any means.

I know that a certificate alone is never enough to enter this field, as it’s all about the portfolio and skills, but I’m looking to see if this is a good starting point to learn the fundamentals in a structured environment. 

Also, can anyone verify that this isn’t run by those for-profit bootcamps that just cash in on the university’s name? I know this is a common practice with university certificates but I can’t find evidence of this for this certificate, which hopefully means it’s run by UW itself.

I was hoping to get an opinion. I was part of a frat and during mid-quarter, I had to drop out due to complicated medical issues that were carrying on before I even dropped my fraternity.

However, even though I dropped they are still trying to get me to pay dues even though they never took me off of the chapter roster after I declared my drop to my president.

Is there any way I can get out of this? I don't think it's reasonable for me to pay a quarter's worth of dues if I never even benefited from being a part of the frat due to my health concerns. And even after I dropped, they never took me off the roster which seems a little sketchy to me.

1bksjmo,[21 Month Update] <2.5 GPA Foster Reject Applies To Husky 100!,"**Previous Posts:**

\[Post 2\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/s/ZwhFJWRUea](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/s/ZwhFJWRUea))

\[Post 3\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/s/SoW3RRHfy6](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/s/SoW3RRHfy6))

&#x200B;

**TL;DR For Previous Posts:** Applied to Foster twice with a low GPA and didn't get in. A lot more goes in to it, but that's the gist of it. My goal is now to get into grad school (Not Foster).

**TL;DR For This Post:** Did two internships, rejected both return offers. Going all in, full speed on my pipe dreams. Husky 100 info at the end. 

Since absolutely no one asked for this, I thought I'd give an update on what I've been upto for all zero people who were waiting for this!

I told myself I wouldn't make an update before something significant happens, and in reality, the saga would be a lot more interesting if I made this post later this fall but when I looked at the last post I made and saw it was 21 months ago I thought maybe I'll post an update now so it doesn't become an even longer post later.

To say I was devastated after what took place in my last post is an understatement. My morale was down in the toilet the entire summer after everything happened, and to be honest, it still pisses me off every time I think about the entire situation, and it pains me even more because, at the end of the day, I put myself in that situation in the first place and I got no one else to blame for it.

I said in my last post I was going to study for the GMAT, but Mental health was nonexistent at the time, and I just couldn't do it so I put it on the back burner (more on that later).

When Fall quarter came around, I was trying to cope with being back at square zero and decided to get my mind off it as much as I could by getting more involved on campus (I think I've doxed myself enough, so I'm leaving it at that)

I don't know what took over me, having had zero hope for internships after what happened to the last one, but I decided to send out two applications for summer 2023 internships, with one of them being a long shot and the other one being a little more of a reasonable reach for me.

I ended up getting a first-round interview a week after my application. A week later, I was invited for a final round interview, and a day later, I got an offer! I accepted it, I think, a week or two later, but honestly, I didn't count on it much after what happened last time, and I had my expectations at zero this time before I was behind my desk, which was nine months away.

This is a story for a different day, but although by all measures, this internship would be a dream for many people with amazing benefits and pay right out of school, it's not what I want to do ultimately, so I wasn't going to call it done here.

That was my fall 2022 quarter. Nothing really happened in Winter and Spring 2023 except two somewhat small things, which I won't mention, although they are kind of relevant to what I want to do later, because if I haven't doxed myself yet, I'll definitely do it by mentioning them! I'll say this, though: They look good on a resume for some brownie points, that's all.

When the Summer quarter came around, I started my internship, and it was a great experience. I didn't accept a full-time offer, though. I still want to do a master's, and as I said earlier, it's not my top choice for a career.

Right after my internship ended, I sent out a handful of applications for Winter 2024 internships at other firms. Within one week, I was invited for an interview for a similar internship at a much larger firm for which I got an offer 4h after my interview. I'm going to leave this one at that, and I'm intentionally being vague because UW Bothell has 5k students on a good day, and I'm definitely doxing myself at this point if I say anything else.

By every measure and metric in the universe, this internship would be a dream for anyone looking to make a career in the said field, but as I mentioned before, that field isn't the end goal for me, so this is not where I'm calling my journey done either, and I did not accept my return offer. Honestly, in this job market, this was a hard choice and a super risky move that may come back to bite me later, but we will see. (yes, I am stressing!)

&#x200B;

**Other Updates:**

* Back to the GMAT studying, masters is still very much something I'm thinking about and again I have to be vague here but the plan is to study for it sometime between now and end of the year as I'm planning to apply in 2024-2025 application cycle.
* My GPA is now above 3.0 from the less than 2.5 that it once was. I have straight 4.0s, but as you can imagine, moving the needle on the number of credits I have is not easy.
* I got into a summer program for 2024 (Being vague to not dox myself) which I would like to believe it was at least somewhat competitive with the average GPA being a 3.7 last year but who knows.
* I got a small scholarship which was kind of fun! It felt good to be recognized for something after all of this. But I also got rejected for two much larger schoolarships which really stung.

**Onto What You Are All Here For:** It comes with great displeasure to inform you all I have not been selected for the Husky 100. 

* Am I sadge? Yes. 
* Do I want to talk about it? No.
* Did I spend 6 hours a day for 3 weeks reliving the worst years of my life crying a river and writing my essay while doing my internship in January? Yes. 
* Will I apply again next year? No. Can't get sadge a second time if you don't try again in the first place.
* Do I feel like all this effort was for nothing? Absolutely!

That's all for now. Season Finale dropping Fall 2024! Either I get into a Master's program or into my local McDonalds as a janitor. Whatever happens, that will be the last update on this. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bksjmo/21_month_update_25_gpa_foster_reject_applies_to/,12,12

For context, I'm an international student who got accepted into UW College of Arts and Sciences for the year 2024. However, I would be deferring admission as I am serving in the army and will be joining in 2025.  

Upon researching on the UW website the undergrad tuition for nonresident is 40k while the total cost of attendance is about 64k. I'm guessing this implies the majority of the remaining 20k is housing. So I've been looking for ways to make it more affordable for me by trying alternative options for residency other than living in the college dorms. 

So my question is basically how are some of the ways I can reduce cost, Maybe by renting my apartment and sharing or something? Also, what are the rates and renting scenes like around the college? I would preferably like a spot closer to campus as I don't have a car and don't see myself traveling super far to get tot college.

1bkp5gk,Why the fascination with Ivys over CS at UDub,"Unless  the CS rankings on USNews and other sites are totally messed up, the way I look at it is that besides MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU and UIUC, every other college is ranked lower for CS. And looking beyond the rankings, I see so many other tangible advantages that aren’t taken into account in the rankings - like UDub’s proximity to all the amazing companies in Seattle - Amazon, Meta, Google, the endowments from Pauly boy and BillyG, the guest lectures by Distinguished Scientists from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others, the wealth of nearby companies to intern at who don’t have to pay for your accommodation in this tight market, the startup scene, and the constantly rising bar of incoming CS Freshman, mostly gene-gifted kids of the sea of software engineer parents in the Puget Sound and beyond. I think UDub CS has an amazing future.

Yet I see this intense fascination with the lesser ranked Ivies and non-Ivies. Are these folks mere brand name chasers who want bragging rights, and/or have been conditioned to think that way by their helicopter parents, or am I missing something else. Do they not know about the CS ranking? Have they just given up on UDUb as out of staters, given its heavy preference for instaters? I could see the argument that this high up in the rankings, the specific order doesn’t matter as much, and all else being equal maybe a brand could open some doors.

1bkjyiy,"Rain City Book Bowl (trivia for book lovers, both new and old!!)","Hey Huskies! (sorry that's really cheesy)

Do you love books? Do you love flexing your book knowledge on others?

Rain City Book Bowl is a joint collaboration between Head in the Clouds Trivia and Quizbowl at the University of Washington. Our goal is to connect book nerds in Seattle by giving them a fun competitive outlet! This league will recur monthly in bookstores around the Seattle area.

Our trial run will be held at the HUB on UW campus. You can expect the event to be a hybrid of Head in the Clouds bar trivia and quizbowl. If you're unfamiliar with either or both of these question styles, no worries! We'll be explaining everything during the event, and I can answer questions in the comments of this post :)

Team size is capped at 4. No teammates? No problem! When you buy your tickets, you can also request to be placed on a team with other players. We hope that this will be a fun way to meet other Seattle readers!

We will be testing your knowledge of both old and new books, so our event will have an equal amount of questions about each. The genres covered will vary, but you can expect to be asked about classic books, sci-fi / fantasy, romance, poetry, and biography / nonfiction.

For more information, follow us on Instagram: raincitybookbowl. We hope to see you there!

Hi everyone! 
I'm coming to Seattle this summer to intern at Amazon. They recommend renting dorms at unis in Seattle (incl UW), so I thought I could ask some questions here:
1. Dorms are ~70/day depending on the college. Is it possible to find a sublease cheaper (I don't really care about the place as long as it's not infested)
2. Which college is most near the Amazon office? What about best location to explore Seattle? 
3. Is it worth bringing a car? Or is Seattle walkable like European cities? I wanna explore the town (and nature, I heard it's very beautiful), but perhaps the car is so much not worth it that I should rather rent whenever I go somewhere?
4. If someone in the same situation stumbled upon this post, pm me and let's meet! ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bkg640/housing_questions/,6,5

1bk8q4s,UW Honors or Cal Poly (political science),"So I was accepted into both, but I'm really struggling with the choice. I was accepted into others too, but I'm planning on going to law school after my degree so I didn't think it made too much sense to spend all of my or my parent's money on undergrad. 

Finances:

I'm a Washington resident and live literally 15 minutes away from the UW so that's a plus. The in-state tuition is about 8k-12k last time I checked, with housing and other shit obviously bringing it up a bit. Cal Poly is about 28k out of state.

Location:

I live in Seattle and I pass the UW all the time. It's a beautiful school but I guess I don't get that ""new"" feeling. But don't get me wrong, it's a great location. The Burke Gilman bike trail is literally right next to it, and I can see my family often. Cal Poly is better weather though. I don't actually like the Cal Poly campus itself, but the surrounding greenery and mountains are fucking incredible. And my cousin goes there so...

Academics:

So in terms of academics, I think the UW is probably going to be better for pols sci, especially because I got into the honors college, but I don't really know. I mean...Cal Poly literally had ""polytechnic"" in the name and that's not really my jam

Running Start:

I'm a running start student meaning by the time I graduate high school I will have my AA degree and 90 college credits. The UW is 100% going to accept all of them. I don't know about Cal Poly, I haven't called yet.

The College ""Experience""

So I've heard from some people the UW has a great social life but then some say it's crap. Iv'e heard the same about Cal Poly. I think both communities will have people who love exploring the outdoors like me because Seattle is generally super outdoorsy. So is Cal Poly though. 

&#x200B;

Iv'e always wanted to live in california but heres how I see it: theres no reason for me to spend around 50k more on Cal Poly, I got into UW honors, UW is pretty too in a different way, and I can always go to California for law school, my gap year after I get my degree, or I can study abroad for a quarter or two.

The only concern I have for the UW is if they'll let me declare my major. Iv'e heard that it takes two years to declare, but since I already have 90 credits, will they just let me declare immediately? Or maybe they'll never let me??

Thanks!

By the time I enter UW, I'll have all the equivalent pre-req's for the Accelerated Honors Advanced Calculus sequence. However, I wasn't admitted to the Honors program. Also, I will be starting UW as a Junior after I transfer my credits over. A few things:

Is it realistic for me to secure a spot in the next offered Math334 course?

Does me being fresh out of highschool affect my performance in a good or bad way for the course? (I.e. would it be harder to transition into UW/general universify if I were to take the course, do you guys reccomend the sequence for basically a Freshman with college credits)

(For math majors): Is the course beneficial for a math major, or is it better for Physics students interested in advanced math concepts? It seems like the topics go by fast, so would it be more beneficial for me to take the math major requirements separately rather than taking them through this class? (I understand that generally speaking, it depends on the person, but for those who have taken Math 334 vs those who took Intro to proofs, intro to analysis, esc, which would provide a more in-depth understanding?)

1bjx40u,Professor Unresponsive About Grade,"To preface, I know that the quarter is over, and I know it's annoying when students try to get their grades raised after they've been submitted. But I also feel like it's the professor's responsibility to communicate expectations clearly and grade fairly.

With that out of the way, here is the situation: I took AMATH 482/582 with Prof. Shlizerman this past quarter, and did pretty good for the most part. However, on the last assignment I got a 12/20, which was a pretty big shock to me as I thought I had done everything required. A look at the rubric (which was not available before the homework was submitted, iirc) tells me that they graded me down for omitting things that were not specified as required (or even mentioned) on the actual homework. Additionally, I was given 0 points for several things that I did actually do. There was no feedback on why I missed these points. From the class discord, I know at least a few other people were graded much more harshly than they were expecting. I sent a canvas message to the professor and the two TAs (one of whom graded my assignment) last night and have not gotten a response. From what other students have told me, the professor has been pretty bad about responding to emails this quarter, and I'm worried I'm not even going to get a response. 

I don't know if getting these points back would change my final grade (he didn't give us a grade scale), and honestly I'm not too upset with my current grade anyway. At this point I honestly just want someone to listen to my concerns and clarify what I did wrong.

1biqzti,Rate my path (ECE Community Transfer),"Hey guys, I'm a senior in highschool. After a stone cold rejection letter, I started researching alternative pathways for me to take, and where UW might fit into a hypothetical pathway. An appeal a day keeps the regrets away, but I must take a realistic adult stance.

I always knew the community college transfer route is a great path, but further research made it seem like it's in fact an amazing path. [Data from UW](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/transfer/ctc-admissions-data) seems to show that almost 70% of transfer applicants are accepted into UW. Among that 70%, it seems that 89% who apply into Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) are accepted? (if I'm interpreting the stats correctly)

If this is true, I feel that this should be a great path to take. After making sure that my community college has the pre-req courses necessary for the ECE major, **do you guys think community college is the way to go? Any advice or people who have gone down a similar path?**

The main thing keeping me from attending another 4-year is cost savings. Not just living from home, but my lenient chill job pays me $24/hour, so staying home while keeping that job could have great financial outcomes. Plus, it seems that as long as I maintain good performance in terms of GPA and activities, I may have an excellent chance at ECE.

Also side question: does UW prioritize certain community colleges over other colleges? The college within my bounds is Olympic College in Bremerton, WA.

I am aware that going from pre-major to CS is near-impossible, and have been advised to look at other schools. However, I really want to stick with UW as it is my top school, and was wondering if my chances would be any better if I took pre-reqs to get into Electrical Engineering. 

Also, is electrical engineering within Paul Allen as well? Thank you for any replies :)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bif3mr/presciences_to_electrical_engineering/,5,2
1biejlz,Do high CSE 142/143 grades make up for lower Calculus grades for the comp sci school?,"A little background info:

I'm applying as a transfer student after returning to school to finish my comp sci prerequisites. I was self-taught prior to this, so I tested out of CSE 141, got a 3.9 in CSE 142, and expect to get a 3.9 this quarter for CSE 143. My Precalculus was 4.0 and I expect to get a 3.3 for Calc I this quarter. My overall GPA is around 3.6 and I'm shooting for 3.82 GPA for Fall-Spring '24.

Can anyone say whether the Paul G Allen School favors higher CSE grades, or would my CSE and MATH grades have equal weight?

Another bit of valuable info: Due to a mixup by Shoreline, I wasn't able to start Calc I until Winter quarter, meaning I'll still be lacking the Calc III necessary for Paul G Allen School. However, my credits will satisfy UWT's CS program by the end of Spring '24, so I may have to attend UWT instead. I also had a rough high school experience and dropped out with a 1.6 GPA at 16. I can see them interpreting that either positively or negatively. 

I realize my time would most likely be better spent asking an advisor, but in my experience they tend to give vague answers so I'm hoping to get some good first hand advice. Thanks all!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1biejlz/do_high_cse_142143_grades_make_up_for_lower/,2,2

1bi98o0,Switching Majors as a Junior,"Hello!

I'm a junior entering my spring quarter, and I'm currently in MCD and hoping to go to medical school. My current gpa is about a 3.71. I transferred here this autumn from UWB and got into my major this Winter quarter. 

My problem is that I've found that I simply don't enjoy MCD the way I thought that I would, and I have been taking health humanities courses (health ethics, health disparities) and have found that I genuinely love them, and I get really excited about taking similar courses. For this reason, I want to switch to global health. I feel like investing in something I'm passionate about and genuinely enjoy will make my undergrad far less misery inducing. 

My problem is that I have changed my mind really, really late. But I've also taken enough humanities courses that fit into the global health (BS) major that I'm actually technically further along the gh track than I am for MCD. I'm completely willing to take a fifth year of classes and to graduate late just to be in this major. I really think that I can be successful studying global health (I've gotten a 3.9-4.0 in every related course). 

I have strong healthcare experience (have volunteered at the ER for six months and have volunteered at health clinics aimed at underserved populations since the age of 14). I know that I can do a minor in global health, but I'd really like to major in it and I want to know if I actually have a chance and if its worth trying to switch over. 

Is it in any way possible that they would admit me? I understand that certain programs have some sort of a timeline in place and that they're less likely to accept you sometimes.

1bi91up,What does it take to get an application rescinded?,"I'm aware its on a case by case basis but I'm genuinely really worried and need some advice.

Not to trauma dump, but for a fuller a picture, in my junior year my dad died which messed up my grades quite a bit. I am a running start student and from what I remember I got one N/C, one D, and one C-. The rest were A's and B's. GPA dropped from 4.0 to I believe a 3.6. 

With those grades I still somehow managed to get accepted for Marine Bio for the 2024 Autumn quarter. 

With that this year has been equally a struggle (due to some extra family issues that were caused from my dads passing) I got two C's fall quarter and I believe I will either be getting a D or an N/C (depending on which I decide to take) and a B for winter quarter. My GPA, without winter quarters grades, is currently a 3.4. 

I have reason to believe that the rest of this year I will get A's and B's as all I'm really taking next quarter are PE classes because that's I still need for grad credits. 

I've talked to my therapist and she says she'll write a letter explaining my current situation which we have reason to believe will improve considerably after I move to college. 

I am fully aware that I messed up big and this is fully on me, no excuses. I know that I will probably get a letter asking what happened. What I really want to know is what has it taken for people to get rescinded in the past and how screwed am I really? I know there will be no guarantees but I just want some form of confirmation on my chances.

I am a current UW sophomore who is applying to the School of Engineering for MechE, CivE, EnvE, and A&A this spring. 

I’ve been told differing opinions from peers whether I have a good chance of getting a spot in engineering. Although I will have prerequisites done in time, my grades are lower than where I want them to be ~3.2-.4 range and unfortunately do not have any engineering rso experience yet.

I have been working in building a portfolio of projects in programs such as solidworks, ansys, and python/matlab in hopes to make up for this and to show my application of what I’ve learned in class to my own personal interests.

I have come here ask if for any advice or recommendations for an alternative major in case I don’t get in or any other candid advice regarding my situation. 

I have been having difficulty in feeling hopeful that I will get in and it’s driven me into a pretty poor mental spiral so I greatly appreciate anything that helps me gain a little bit of peace of mind.

1bgvw0n,OOS affordability (or lack there of) and general advice,"Hi, I just got admitted as an OOS applicant into pre social science. I have like a billion questions, so advice on any of them would be greatly appreciated.

In terms of OOS affordability, wtf is the deal? I got $4200 from the Purple and Gold scholarship, so that covers a tiny bit (tysm so so generous 😭) but what am I looking at for total cost? I would look into this on my own but i’m honestly so confused on varying sticker prices. I have around 60k (probably a little less) in college savings, but I know that’s not going to cover all four years, maybe not even one. Does the university give any more money based on the FAFSA? Or am I totally screwed? My FAFSA is already messed up because the 2022 information is before my father quit his job and went off the deep-end leaving me in a single income divorced family situation so idk the expected contribution. I think my mom makes around 100k a year but she really only got our house and the cars in the divorce so there’s not a ton of equity there. 

With the financial context set, assuming UW is even an option, how does applying to majors work? This quirky system scares me because I am wholly unsure of my future career and major. I like political science but would probably go to law school after because there’s not a lot of jobs there (especially that pay well). I also like biology and anthropology but don’t want to be in academia. I’m hoping that I’ll find a career that pairs my interests in a way that also pays off my debt lmfao. With my uncertainty in mind, wtf do I do my freshman year. It seems like you have to be proactive about taking prereqs for the majors and that they’re competitive and I feel like it’ll be hard to compete when I literally don’t know where I’ll be competing.

This is a more general question about college trade-offs, but is it really worth it to go somewhere that feels boring and unfulfilling if it’s the cheapest option? I got into UMN with honors (I’d have little to no debt there), but it’s only 5 hours from home and I need to get out of the midwest lol.

1bgvaoh,"Admitted Pre-Sciences I’m UWS and UWB, want CS","Title. I want to do CS at UW Seattle because I attended Cascadia College for running start, so attending UWB would not be exciting. I am very interested in Data Science and am thinking of accepting UWS and trying to apply for the CS and/or Statistics major. I feel like I will have a good chance to get in because I will have my CSE143 equivalent, Calc 3, and physics 3 completed from my community college with all likely 4.0s. I also feel like I got put into pre-sciences because they didn’t see my grades for these classes. Also I got a couple good CS and research internships lined up for the summer, so that could make for a good essay?

Do you guys think I have a chance? Or should I attend UWB for the easier chance to get into CS, or should I continue going to a CC and then try transferring directly into the CS major? Looking for advice…

1bgtlyg,Unsure about retaking a math class,"So I just got my final back for a class I thought I did good in only to see I got 10 points below the average with a max score of 60. This was in math 300 and I knew it was going to be confusing but I went to every lecture except for one and used office hours and frequently asked questions in class and was doing relatively well on the homeworks but seeing that final grade might not only rank my overall grade but hit my confidence as well.

I should clarify by saying that I wanted to do a minor in math and am declaring geography data science next quarter and am a second year. The only other math class I took on campus was diffeq and I got a 2.6 in that as I just never really understood some of the content. I’m essentially trying to figure out if I am the problem and maybe I shouldn’t be taking these math classes or it’s worth giving it another shot as I am planning on doing linear algebra next quarter and I expect that to be a challenge.

What it's about: all of the dirty laundry that gets aired by genetic tests like 23andme and AncestryDNA. We'll talk about how it's a paternity test not just for you but all your relatives, finding relatives, finding relatives of serial killers to solve cold cases,  ancestry analysis at many levels and surprises, including about how race and ethnicity are not the same thing, about dodgy marketing of products and eating disorders, about intersex surprises, about health interpretations that people stumble into, and about reproductive implications, with detours for ranting about ablism and homophobia and transphobia and racism and cultural appropriation with the ability to get credit for it. 

Who it's for: 

* anyone who has wanted to do a direct-to-consumer genetic test or has done one or has relatives who have done one
* premeds who are going to be seeing patients wielding their test results
* anyone who wants a 5 credit course that meets Natural World Credit and Social Science distribution requirements in a fun and approachable way
* anyone who wants to get a fairly easy, fun good grade in their spring quarter *without any exams ,* with flexibility about lecture attendance vs asynchronous viewing, and with assignments that are largely done in discussion section
* people who want a strong letter of recommendation from a teaching team that will get a chance to know you and plausibly assess your quantitative and scientific reasoning skills and your leadership and group work and cultural competence and ethics, i.e. all the stuff that grad schools and employers like to hear about

Why I think you, a redditor, should specifically consider it: I've never taught a course that relied so heavily on reddit as source material. I've considered framing multiple assignments in AITA format. 

Thanks for considering the shameless advertisement, and wishing all a good spring break!

\- how realistic are the chances of transferring from pre-sciences to cs?  
\- how does the transfer process work? when would i transfer in the year? what classes would i take in my first year?  
\- is pre-science a major in itself from which i transfer to cs or do i pick another major first and then transfer from that to cs or get stuck with that major forever?  
\- if the latter, then what majors do i pick for the best chances of transfer to cs? can i pick acms from pre-sciences? the website says that acms is capacity constrained - does this mean that if they've also  admitted people dtm already, it's gonna be insanely hard to get in?? i wouldn't want to be stuck with microbiology since that's the only science major that's not capacity constrained. alternatively, can i pick a major from the college of engineering or the college of information when i got into pre-sciences.  
\- and finally, if i don't even get accepted to cs in transfer, can i transfer to electrical and computer engineering or computer science and engineering? how easy is it to transfer to either of these majors instead?

1bfk899,To Those Who Would Pull A Fire Alarm During A Final,"I get it, I really do, sometimes finals just suck that much. But you have to realize that you're just screwing yourself and everyone else over by doing that. 

My final exam just got completely invalidated after someone pulled the fire alarm (extremely likely a student trying to disrupt the exam, or at least an exam in the building) because half the class then proceeded to cheat. I worked hard to try and do well on that exam because I felt my grade could really use the boost and now it was for nothing. There was even someone in my class who decided not to study for any other classes in favor of this one and now their work is just gone as a result. 

So to those who would pull an alarm during exams, please reconsider, because you're just hurting everyone, including yourself.",Academics,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bfk899/to_those_who_would_pull_a_fire_alarm_during_a/,14,153

1bf5d5j,PSA for Admitted First Years about Majors,"Congratulations all incoming huskies! 

Every year there is some confusion about majors and applying to UW, and I’m seeing some of that here, so I hope this can clear some things up.

When you applied for UW and selected your intended major, if you are admitted that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re actually in the major. Only a select number of majors have the potential for incoming first years to be directly admitted, and those are listed at the attached link. MOST majors at UW do not allow for direct admit, so if you selected any of those majors on your application as your intended major and were admitted, you were admitted to UW as major undeclared, and may be noted as “pre-major”, “pre-sciences”, “pre-health”, or “pre-art” in your portal, all of these mean you don’t have a major.

Psychology for example does not have direct admit, so if you selected psychology and were admitted, you are not actually IN the psychology major. You would need to look up psychology’s pre-requisites, complete those courses, and apply once you’re here. Some majors are selective and competitive to get into, some only have minimum requirements that as long as you complete those you’re admitted, and some majors are open, meaning there are no pre-reqs and you can declare at any time.

Please just be aware during your planning for your first year that there are some steps you may need to take in order to actually get into your major, and plan to take those pre-reqs as soon as possible. UW is different than other schools that will typically admit you into your major when you’re admitted to the school, but UW more often than not will admit only to the school and not directly to any major. 

I hope this clears some things up!

1bf1blq,Spacious room for rent in Ravenna neighborhood [AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY],"Hi guys! I am moving home after this quarter and am looking for someone to take over my room because my house's lease goes through August.

The house is located in the Ravenna neighborhood, about a 20 minute walk from campus. It is right next to a stop on the 67 bus line and about a 5 minute walk from the Roosevelt Link station. You would have 6 other roommates in the house, who are all males. Most of them are athletes at UW, so you end up having the house to yourself a fair bit. The house is spacious and has a large kitchen upstairs as well as a nice living room with couches and a TV to hangout in.

As for specifics to the room, it is generously sized and already partially furnished. There is a queen size bed/mattress, a dresser, a desk, and a large garment rack that I would be willing to pass along. The room is downstairs in the house, and right next to a separate kitchen area with an oven, stove, fridge, and sink that myself and one other roommate have to ourselves. The room is also across the hall from a full bathroom that is also shared between myself and one other roommate.

As put in the title, the room is also available immediately. March rent is already paid for, so if you wanted to move in next week you would end up getting half a month or so for free. Rent comes out to about $1000 per month, including utilities. There is actually another room in the house that's going to be available soon as well, so if anyone wanted to move in with a friend we would probably be able to make that work.

Extra curriculars: 4 years of Varsity basketball & track, where I was captain for both sports during 2 of the years. AAU circuit basketball for 4 years. Music Studio Internship. I worked at a construction company. I worked at a restaurant. I volunteered. And I did a foreign exchange program in Costa Rica.

I am very confident in my personal statement because of the high grade I earned on my personal statement assignment from my ENGL 101 teacher who is notorious for being a very harsh grader. I got one of the best scores in my school.

I explained in the additional essay that the reason why my GPA is so low, is because I failed 4 classes in the second semester of 10th grade. This was due to my father passing away, and my brother being sent to a psychiatric ward for schizophrenia due to him being very violent.

On top of this, when I came back to school in 11th grade, I earned straight A’s in all of my classes. And prior to second semester of 10th grade, I was a A/ High B student.

I do a lot of theater at school and is a drama officer. I wrote my optional essay about how much I love theater and what I love about it. I also do DECA on the side too my senior year.

I mean, I have been here for 3 years and I had to look up her name. I have zero awareness of any contribution she has made but would like to know if she has.

Also, grad and post-grad students recently protesting for wage increases while the president collects a million dollars seems far too polarizing for a university that strives to be progressive and fair. The grads and post grads make up a huge chunk of the workforce and the success, or lack thereof, of the workforce, should be factored into the presidents salary.

Open March 8th-12th

The ASUW Board of Directors elections are taking place April 15th-17th. All of the candidates' campaigns have a focus on engagement and outreach. With that in mind, we have worked together, along with EAC, to write this survey so we all have a greater understanding on how we as ASUW can better assist our peers on campus.

This survey is split into 3 sections, general demographic questions, policy questions, and candidate preferences. The goal is for us to gain a further understanding of issues are facing on campus and to gauge the effectiveness of our engagement. You don't have to answer all the questions, but doing so will make it as accurate as possible.

After looking around for resources on practicing technical interviews, I could only come up with youtube videos of mock interviews and websites where you have to pay hundreds of dollars to practice one technical interview. Not all of us (myself included) have the money to spare on these sites, and personally I prefer practicing for real rather than watching someone else in a mock interview. 

&#x200B;

This has led me to start work on a proposal to the Allen School on a way to allow students to practice in a no-cost, risk-free environment with people who have experience conducting technical interviews.

I have taken courses from Fall, Winter quarter but want to take time off in the Spring quarter because I am enrolled here at Queen's. I hope to start at UW from Summer quarter if possible. Is this allowed for an international student? Thank you guys so much!

But I wanted to enroll at Udub so much that I instead took several online courses for the Fall and Winter quarter. It has been some of the best courses I have ever taken even if they were online. I really enjoyed the format and the quality of the courses.

Luckily for me, I applied to both American and Canadian institutions at that time. I was also accepted by Queen's University in Canada. And during the time when I took the online courses from UW, I successfully received my Canadian student visa, which is kind of a relief for me.

But for me Queen's University is good but it is not like Udub which has a superiority in STEM and CS over almost all universities you can imagine(excluding some top schools, like Stanford, and Berkeley). I still hope to go there. And that is why I kept taking online courses from UW while I was registered at another University. I still have the opportunity to transfer here without filling out a returning student form or reapply.

I want to get into the cs major in tacoma but it turns out the programming classes i took in seattle (cse 121 and cse 122) might not even satisfy the prereqs back in tacoma (tcss 142 and tcss 143). For the tcss 143 course the prereqs is the complimentary course below it (tcss 142) or cse 142 in the seattle campus, and as we all know that’s not available anymore. As for the prereqs for tcss 142 I still need to pass calc 1 which i unfortunately failed last quarter. The plan i thought up with might be either asking my counselor if me taking cse 122 might satisfy the tcss 143 prereq or just getting calc 1 over with this spring followed by taking tcss 142 + calc 2 in the summer and tcss 143 in the fall.

1b0olcw,A very gentle reminder about lecture seating ,"Before I begin, let the record show I do not think this is a big, devastating deal. It is just a slight awkward inconvenience. 

I’m left handed, and whenever there are exams in lecture halls without assigned seats, I am reminded that many people do not process that left side aisle seats have left handed desks. People seem to favor aisle seats so if I don’t get there right away, all the leftie desks are filled. During lectures, most people use laptops for notes so it’s not an issue, but with exams it’s ever so slightly annoying. My options are to either have an unnecessarily awkward writing position for the exam, or to have to ask someone “are you left handed?” and ask them to move when they say no fwhich in my experience, they always do). I wouldn’t be as bothered if the two outcomes weren’t always a) the person seeming awkward and embarrassed or b) the person looking at me like I just spoke an alien language. 

So, let this be a kind and gentle reminder that the left aisle desks are for left handed people, and using one as a right handed person is gonna be unnecessarily uncomfortable for you too! ",Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1b0olcw/a_very_gentle_reminder_about_lecture_seating/,7,95

I really want to get into UW and have a good shot but I applied to Informatics so I might not get DA.

I know CS is a no go if you don't get DA but if you're a student interested in Informatics or IS in the foster school is it stupid going to UW over UWB.

If you guys have your writing gen ed left, I would recommend taking ESS 101 for it in Spring. The writing portion is an essay on top of the normal assignments. I found it to be more interesting and fun compared to a typical English writing course. The class size is big so there will be a chance for everyone to register (online & in person). You won't need prior Geology knowledge to do well. If you have a high workload next quarter, this is a great class to sign up for. Professor Swanson is also the most enthusiastic prof I have had so far; no lectures are boring! You do one lab a week, a short reading, and there are two exams. There are also field trips and other extra credit assignments!

1at6ffd,Student Leadership Opportunity: Helping Homeless Communities,"Hi everyone! Wanted to share more about a leadership opportunity for those interested:

**Hearts for the Homeless International** is a student-led nonprofit organization that provides free blood-pressure screening opportunities and heart health education to homeless populations around the United States and globally. We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity! 

We are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.

The work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well. Some of our other significant achievements include leading an effort to rescue the homeless in multiple cities from hurricanes, partnering with Shark Tank’s Bombas Socks, as well as being published by [Forbes Magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2017/11/06/how-young-leaders-are-strengthening-community-responses-to-disasters/#77391a361850). 

We want to be able to help serve the struggling community of unhoused individuals in Seattle. According to the most recent 2023 [Annual Homelessness Assessment Report](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2023-AHAR-Part-1.pdf), Seattle is ranked in the top 5 for major cities with the largest number of people experiencing homelessness.

\- Cumulative GPA = All graded courses taken at UW or accepted via transfer to UW. My son did some of his studies at SU.

\- Pre-Admission-GPA = Is this GPA for all business school prerequisites? Or GPA from all classes from recent quarters?

Also, do you know if a dropped class reflects badly on your application? My son missed 3 weeks due to illness this quarter and he may need to drop a course. We're hoping that they only look at GPA since he can take the class next quarter again.

1as1lwc,Going to ode to socialize?!!,"disclaimer: I have a feeling this post isn’t going to get very happy responses, i’m literally posting this on an alt account lol but here goes.

 I’ve been practically living at ode this week studying my ass off, and for two days in a row then the day of my actual exam people would come into one of the classrooms (where people go to study quietly or to discuss work quietly) as if it were a cafe? and just be loud and obnoxious? like even with my noise cancelling headphones it’s crazy how loud these ppl were, and they weren’t doing work or anything. 

Is ode now just a place to hang out now? has uw social life fallen that much? I’m a third year, and i’ve never seen this before- other libraries, sure, but odegaard is like where people go to buckle down and get shit done, yet there was fully a couple there for a DATE for valentines. for a lack of better words, what the fuck? sorry this is a bit aggressive for my tastes, but it was so damn irritating, like some of the conversations I was forced to endure were incredibly dull and hard to ignore.

I totally get going to ode and socializing in the common space, near the stairs and such where nobody is head down at a table grinding; But going to a room and sitting down at a booth to yap your ass off while everyone else in the room is trying to focus is so annoying. Thoughts anyone?

1ar3c7q,"Given my unique situation, should I be putting my graduation date as March or June of 2024?","Hi all,

I’m a senior who will be graduating this year. I’m in a unique situation where this is my last “real” quarter of classes, as in my last quarter where I will be attending classes in-person. I have finished all of the requirements for my degree and major, and I could have technically applied to graduate after Winter quarter. However, I will be taking a full-time credit course load in the Spring for two reasons: to finish one of my two minors (only one class remaining) and to be able to receive an additional quarter of the generous financial aid that has essentially paid me to attend school. So, I will only be taking one class for one of my two optional minors I have added on, and the rest will just be fun and easy electives to hit the full time requirement for financial aid. 

All of these classes that I am taking are completely online, and my classes for Winter quarter will be concluding at the beginning of March. As a result, I have been looking for full-time jobs starting immediately since I have the availability to begin my career early, and to get a head start versus having to compete with many more people who also will be graduating in June.

Here’s my question: on my resume, I have been listing that I am graduating in March of 2024, since I will have technically met every single requirement for my degree, both general electives and my specific concentration, outside of the one optional minor. Furthermore, I am afraid if I list June that employers will think I am not available until then and would reject my application thinking I don’t have the availability to start right away. This is something that if granted initial interviews, I plan on clarifying right away that while I could technically have my degree, on paper I technically do not, given the reasons above, but that I will in 3 months. I don’t want to “deceive” anyone, but given my unique situation I think I am better off putting March and then explaining my situation if I am provided an interview

I guess what I’m trying to ask is, is this okay to do? Am I technically lying? I don’t want employers to possibly think I am trying to be deceitful or something of the sorts. I saw a TikTok about someone who lied and said they had a degree and they didn’t when they were technically 6 credits short. They had gone through 3 interviews without disclosing it, and had their offer rescinded as a result. I’m not sure if that person was still actively in school or not, but now it has left me paranoid. Should I be putting June instead, even though I am able to start right now? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

We are a lab in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences here at UW and we are looking for **MALE ADULTS (ages 18+)** to participate in some research studies. (We are specifically in need of AMAB participants right now, but all genders are welcome!)

In general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do NOT stutter for a variety of experiments in which you'll be compensated $20/hr. We can reimburse for street parking and we will provide you with a free hearing screening as part of the experiment.

Most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words or sentences off a screen. Some studies involve measuring your brain function while you wear an electrode cap (just like a swim cap). We have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

If you are interested, or have any questions at all, please email us at [maxlab@uw.edu](mailto:maxlab@uw.edu)!

1aq0mw7,Hiring speeds in ‘23-24,"I’ve already searched the history of this sub to see what the experience is like and saw that they were supposed to be revamping their system to improve it. Anyone know if that’s taken place yet and what the experience is like more recently?  If you’re written off as not a viable candidate do you at least get the rejection immediately or are you left in limbo until someone signs the offer letter. 

This is my second experience so far with their hiring process and I feel like it was much quicker the first time but then again it was for a lower titled position. 

History:

I applied back in April of last year for a position. Got the email for an interview 2 days later and they wanted to interview the next day. Ended up postponing the interview by one week because one day left little to no time to get in the mindset for one etc. 

I left the interview feeling confident that I was able to articulate why I would make a good candidate and almost immediately after (same day) the manager asked for my references. I was able to send my ref to them quickly and they contacted them first thing in the morning the following day. Unfortunately for me I also got a call from my doctor that I would need an emergency procedure (such awful timing) and that recovery and follow ups would take 3-4 months. Knowing how fast things were moving (interview, reference checks) I knew I had to withdraw immediately which I did. They understood and encouraged me to apply again if/when I was ready.

Flash forward to December ‘23. I have fully recovered and everything should be fine, just requires routine monitoring etc. I applied again but everything moving at a much slower pace this time around. I applied in December but I know how places work and things freeze usually in December, not sure how or why they even posted it. I heard back mid Jan and interviewed end of Jan (3 weeks ago). I left the interviewing feeling not as confident. Not sure what happened but definitely didn’t go as well as my one in April. They didn’t ask for references immediately at the end either and I wrote it off as them remembering having spoken to them already, or that I bombed. A week after the interview (2 weeks ago) they ask for my references and I send almost the same ones but I’ve added my medical director.  Only issue now is that they have yet to contact any of them?  Not sure if that’s a good sign or not?  They specifically told me they would contact all the candidates and notify them of the decision which I interpreted as please don’t bother me with follow-ups but I’d really like to know where I stand. My career is pretty niche especially for the PNW so my opportunities are slim so im pretty dead set on this one. 

I currently work at public health/learning institution so I’m familiar with slow and red tape issues but my current one is at least allowed to notify the candidate that the offer is coming it just takes time to draft it (unless my manager goofed).",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1aq0mw7/hiring_speeds_in_2324/,3,7

The community at UW MCB seemed wonderful when I visited, but I've also gotten good vibes from the other programs so far (except for Cornell, which I haven't interviewed with yet).

Background on me, if it helps:

\- I've grown up in small (Midwestern) towns and don't mind them. But I also feel like I could adapt to a smaller city like Seattle relatively easily

\- I LOVE seafood, hiking/camping, water activities, and skiing. I know it'd be harder to fulfill all of these requirements in Providence or Ithaca compared to Berkeley or Seattle...

\- I plan to go into academia, and would very much like to become tenure track. Unfortunately, I have heard that prestige and legacy really do open doors in academia. Genuinely asking (because I'm truly ignorant about these things), how recognizable is the UDub name? How prestigious is UDub's MCB graduate program? Would I have to do my PhD in Fred Hutch to turn heads, or would other partner institutes and UW campus labs also garner major respect? 

\- At this point, I have fairly equal labs/PIs of interest at all 4 institutions, so availability of research interests are not a limiting factor in my decision",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1apfply/why_udub_and_why_not_uc_berkeley_brown_or_cornell/,12,0

1aot826,Geography Data Science: Everything You Need To Know,"Hello dawgs,

If you're reading this, you either didn't get into a major or you're a freak that likes maps. Either way, it's going to be okay. 

I'm writing this because there is a severe lack of student resources about the Geography Data Science major, and it is an open major which creates a lot of questions.  So from the coursework to the department to the career prospects, I am going to give you everything I know about being in GDS.

**How do you know if GDS is for you?** 

You need to have a passion for data visualization, coding, and maps. It is a great technical degree in a growing industry.

First of all, the Geography department is a relatively small department of students and faculty that is hidden on the fourth floor of Smith Hall. From what I've seen, Geography coursework is separated into two categories. Half of the classes are more humanities-based geography classes focused on the historical, political, and socio-economic aspects of geography. Highly interesting, but nothing technical. The other half are data science classes focused on developing maps with custom software and scripting languages.

Geography Data Science is a Bachelors of Science degree. An audit will require that you take a shit ton of 300 level Geography classes, intro CSE classes, and a machine learning course(s). 

**The classes I have taken in order of importance:**  
GEOG 360: intro mapping class focused on an open-source mapping software, QGIS. Somewhat tedious, maybe a little boring, but highly important.

GEOG 458: taught by the same prof as 328, another class that teaches more advanced techniques for geospatial web programming. The projects you build in this class can be pretty professional. HTML/CSS/Mapbox/ArcGIS API JS/Node.js/PostgreSQL. Also a choose your own adventure and teaches you a lot about mapping ethics.

GEOG 328: teaches you how to create web based visualizations using javascript/html/css and Mapbox. Great technical add and covers a lot of material. Projects are great for a portfolio.

GEOG 465: introductory SQL class teaching you how to map using a PostgreSQL backend. Highly important for full-stack coding, a little tedious at times.

GEOG 450: a Python course focused on creating Seattle based visualizations that have nothing to do with maps. Teaches python scripting, web crawling, d3.js and more. Not the most necessary class but certainly helpful.

Favorite profs: 

Gunwha Oh: the dawg, super sweet Korean lady that cares about her job, her students, and maps!

Bo Zhao: the beast, this guy makes maps like a mofo. Best laid-out classes in the major. All on github.

&#x200B;

**Career Prospects:**

* Level One: ArcGIS monkey, using ESRI products to build out data viz. This is the most simplistic, most common way to perform GIS and the lowest paying.
* Level Two: GIS Web Dev, create geospatial applications using full stack.
* Level Three: Geospatial Data Scientist, be a god of the domain. Basically, just a data scientist with a geospatial stack, creating data pipelines, viz, applications, and ml models. 

There are infinite ways to make money in geospatial. Just think, the more skilled you are the more you are likely to get paid.

Where Can I Work?:  
Any tier-one company, of course. Anything that has to do with maps. I noticed a lot of government jobs require highly specific geospatial web app skills. Even Pokemon Go hires Geography Data Scientists. Look up ESRI as well, this is one of the largest mapping companies.

classes I have heard about:

Urban GIS, GEOG 317 and a few others are all ESRI based classes using ArcGIS. Supposedly teach you some cool stuff with an industry staple software.

Also, I personally feel like the vibes of shows has changed. They use to all be about inclusivity and being yourself and I use to have a lot of fun at them and enjoyed talking to people, but I feel like the last couple times I've gone to the bakery I have felt very unwelcomed and like no one wants to talk to me. One clear thing I have noticed is people dress up way more for the shows, I feel like I can't just wear what I wore to class that day anymore. I have to put on some elaborate trend setting outfit with cool eyeliner just for people to not cut me i the bathroom line. I understand self expression, but its gotten to a point where it feels like I have to perform and present a certain way just to attend. Honestly it feels like I'm back in high school except in high school I was too queer for the cool kids and now I feel like I don't present queer enough, but now all the cool kids are bi in a het relationship and don't like the word lesbian because it ""sounds too harsh"".

I haven't attended one in a while though, is this still the vibe? Does it still get PACKED? and idk maybe because it 420 and there's no theme it might not be as intense.  My friends and I are thinking or going, but also seriously not because this is an experience we've all felt. have people had good experiences there as of lately? What type of people have been attending?

\- I'm going into humanities/liberal arts, so I'm not planning on anything STEM (I've heard these majors are harder and more competitive). How competitive are some of the liberal arts majors? I know this is super broad, so I'm not looking for anything specific, but just a general idea of what that vibe is generally like.

So when I was done with CC, I looked and realized I could only apply to get a degree that had no prerequisites. Even English had a LONG list of prerequisite classes I had never taken. I'm pretty stupid for not preparing. I also don't intend to waste more money on taking those prerequisites at the cc, I am not in the financial position to do that and then wait another year for admission at UW. 

For a little context I will be a lawyer, and I just knew I would take a major that was focused in humanities and arts and then head out to law school. So I chose classics(as a transfer) and will start this year. 

So now I'm curious on what to expect for this major. I love history and reading so I'm not worried I won't like it, but I wonder, what type of people take these classes? it was clearly not my intended major and I don't know anyone that's taken a major like this, it's even more ""out there"" than Philosophy.

1c2wqlo,Major change,"Hey everyone!
I applied for this admission cycle and was directly admitted to Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences. Given the relatively early deadline of UW, I was not completely sure of my major at the time although I was sure it was going to be either Chemistry or Chemical Engineering. So I applied as a Chemistry major without giving it much thought, but I decided I was going to pursue engineering a while after I applied to UW. Now that I am accepted and UW actually it’s one of my top choices, I realize that I should’ve applied as an engineering major if I wanted to pursue ChemE. Hence my questions are, can direct admits change their major after enrolling? If so, how difficult would be for me to change my major from Chemistry to ChemE? And how competitive is it to get directly admitted to Chemistry? I am an international student, if it’s a factor.

1c2i3ul,CS Major Financial Value Between Schools UIUC UMich UW,"Hello, I’ve gotten admitted to UW (instate), UIUC, and UMich (Engineering) all for CS. My goal is to go into quantitative finance (researcher/trader) or work at a startup. This means I will likely do a math double major/minor along with perhaps pursuing graduate school in CS or Math. The cost difference between UW compared to UIUC and UMich is about 20k/year after scholarships and other stuff is included (have not gotten finaid package back so could be less than 20k).

I like UW but the problem is ik alot of ppl from UW and they mostly go into SWE and FAANG/big company jobs (based on linkedin and talking to many UW ppl) which is not something I’m interested in. UIUC has more finance recruiters and proximity to Chicago for finance and UMich has Ross school of business (I could minor here) which attracts finance people. For UIUC I could also switch to CS + Math or + Physics since they offer those programs in undergrad + I like the school a lot too.

I am not quite sure about the startup scene throughout these schools since none of them are near bay area.

If I choose to go to UIUC or Umich I WILL NOT be taking loans or going into debt due to my grandparents. Please help me choose whether the UIUC/Umich is worth it especially for someone who wants to work in finance/startups.

Side notes: I also got GT but I think its basically the same as UW but more expensive (lmk if I’m wrong).

1bzciqi,Idea: Be nice to the people you want to convince,"EDIT: I am making the exact same mistake, the title is ironically a lesson I should listen to. The original post was a cathartic angry release and it was more about me feeling better than addressing the audience (""HUB vandals"", etc). 

Especially w/Gaza war and killing, it's too much death to wrap your head around and I think that it is probably unleashing shock/defensiveness/cognitive dissonance worldwide. I got in my own way by just indulging in being pissed and I respectfully do believe vandals did as well.

It is much easier to cross the bridge and change your mind (political opinion, etc) when the other person is inviting you in with open arms. I have been in the situation of needing to change before and you can psychologically feel the difference between when ""agreeing"" is framed as ""defeat"" and when it's ""joining your friends to do the right thing"".

I know that it is possible to get ourselves out of the way (vandals, reactionaries, me yapping and malding etc) and keep keep keep telling the people we know about all the bombing and killing in Gaza. It should be impossible to ignore.

This is exactly why I was writing about ""being careful about how we do it"". I think that it's important to be measured in your activism because you can appeal to people's emotions, beliefs etc without inviting pride, defensiveness, ego etc to the door.

This is one of those massively important and sickening historical events, and as a consequence it is so easy to frame as something to get on board with rather than using shame or force. We are very lucky to not have to use force in our situation.

I believe you (vandals) are righteous motherfuckers... you make me think about how much I'm willing to be uncomfortable... AND I think the expression of that has impacts; you can certainly see them below.

ORIGINAL POST:

This is addressed to ""the HUB vandals"", to distinguish between those who were trying to show the world the horrible truth about Gaza, and those who were ideologically masturbating with Sharpies.

Israel's reputation thrives off being known as the ""orderly security force"", as opposed to the ""frothing radical Palestinian terrorists"". This is a lie. Regardless, western media, American politicians, and the public are looking closely for examples.

This is an unfair box to be put in. You cannot be complacent sign-holders, and at the same time, you cannot be window-breakers. Civil disobedience is the remedy, this is a PERFECT opportunity for a sit-in. The cause needs the attention.

You can really tell how much someone gives a shit by how much they're willing to decenter themselves. And it seems that some of you really hate your audience. Yelling at reporters, slinging slurs, etc. Openly harassing anyone who came to PUBLICIZE YOUR DEMONSTRATION. (The goal)

When directly offered media attention... by the THE STATE-SPONSORED UNIVERSITY NEWSPAPER... which was going to show up, and has the largest audience... you cut off your nose to spite your face, and decided the Daily was ""too liberal"". And now the people you yelled at have a statement out about how much you yelled at them.

The vandalism is the perfect example. You could have covered the HUB wall to wall in flyers, communicated just as well, and then you would have had plenty of photos of UW staff taking them down. The cause gets the attention for longer, the administration has less to slander you with. You GAIN ATTENTION and SYMPATHY (support. for the cause. remember the cause?) at the cost of IMMEDIATE CATHARTIC RELEASE.

These choices were clearly made to show that ""the movement"" would not be moderated or constrained by authority. These are choices of ideological purists, tribalist book-thumpers, self-interested folks.

Have you noticed how protestors in worse circumstances-- PALESTINIANS, FOR EXAMPLE-- seem to be chiefly interested in impact, effect, and visibility? There is no armed struggle to wage on Red Square, so surely you are responsible for crafting the most-heard protest, not the most-strong.

There is NO EITHER-OR CHOICE between ""caring about optics"" and ""denouncing civilian carpet-bombing"", actually, and Lenin's spirit is not judging you from the sky. 

How can you so desperately want power and refuse to level with your audience? 1960s revolutionaries knew how to strategize to defeat the Western media machine, you guys just seem to know how to get mad. To those stubborn leftists who are putting themselves before their cause, I hope you are ignored in the public square for as long as you can't figure out how to accept what you can't control. 

(If you are unfamiliar with the killing in Gaza, you ought not to be hated for it, and you are welcome under the umbrella of protecting innocent life. The Wikipedia page for the ""Israel–Hamas war"", while Westernized, is a much better picture of the situation than what American news media will promote)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bzciqi/idea_be_nice_to_the_people_you_want_to_convince/,7,39

Apartments seem like the best option, so I've been looking into Cedar, Mercer Court, Nordheim, Radford, and Stevens. Getting a single at any of these as a freshman, however, seems very challenging.

1bxunar,Petition to have a student referendum on the termination of students/groups responsible for the vandalism of the Husky Union Building (HUB),"Obviously, the vandalism inside the HUB is like poking the bear, but going after student artwork? Why are you dragging students who took the time to make those pieces of artwork and throwing them into the fire? You may outnumber the administration, but by triggering a chain reaction of friends of students who made those artworks, leading to more friends, you will be the one outnumbered in the end. 

Here's my reasoning for this referendum. I will address the elephant in the room: the group SUPER UW.

The student referendum. Unlike the elephant, it's the best chance we can end this without any violence. If the majority of current students want them responsible for the student referendum, the university administration will take action. I mean, who wouldn't do that under the banner of 'the majority of our students want us to take action against this vandalism'? 

Now, the group and its supporters may spin this student referendum as an abuse of power from the administration, but it's not really an abuse of power if they took action based on the statement that 'the majority of our students want us to take action against this vandalism.' Don't you love democracy? 

Another spin would be that the administration is silencing the minority of students in their university. This would be an amazing argument...if you didn't have your supporters vandalize literally anything in the HUB. 

We all know that they are the ones organizing these protests—the one that started from the Quad at 6 p.m. on Friday and stayed at the HUB overnight. Here is their official post from their Instagram. 

super\_uw: We’ve begun an overnight sit-in in the HUB. We are in firm solidarity with Palestinians facing genocide, demanding that UW materially and academically divest from Israel, cut all ties with Boeing, and end the anti-Palestinian repression of students, workers, and faculty.

Join us tonight at the HUB until International Quds Day. 

The vandalism happened when they did the sit-in inside the HUB overnight. The vandalism happened during the sit-in inside the HUB overnight. The vandalism inside the HUB is plastered with their motives. 

You don't have to be rocket scientists to combine two and two. 

The group, SUPER UW, should take responsibility for this matter, as they were in the closest proximity to the vandalism. Yet, they haven't. They believe that this was a peaceful protest, even though there were crimes against students and their artworks were subjected to vandalism, as none of the artworks were about the main issue. 

Another official statement: 

“Inside, dozens of students are preparing to take back our student union building as a place to express our collective power as people committed to Palestinian liberation and encampments free from Zionism,” a speaker from the United Front for Palestinian Liberation at UW said. “Several of these students are attaching themselves to a device called a lockbox which makes it almost impossible for them to be removed against their will.”  - TheDaily (University allows pro-Palestinian protesters to occupy HUB overnight)

Dozens of students? Did y'all vandalize dozens of students' artwork in the HUB? Ironic, isn't it? Except this time, everyone knows that the group and the individuals responsible for the vandalism will drag unrelated students into their own self-proclaimed goal. They proved that you would be collateral damage to their cause, whether you liked it or not. 

They did that with students' artwork inside the HUB, **UNRELATED TO THE PROTEST**. 

Who's next?

If they can get away with this without any repercussions, I bet they will do it again. 

And the next one will be even more crazier. Don't be surprised by their next one.

I've been cramming the classes I need to be finished with my first two years (currently taking CEE220, ME230, and PHYS123). After this, all I need is AMATH301 and AA260. My original plan was to do AA260 this summer and AMATH301 in the autumn. But I've recently been thinking about just taking both classes in the summer. The only downside is I won't be living here this summer and I'll have to commute to UW. I also just applied for my major through the capacity constrained route, so lots of this stuff is just up in the air for now. I was wondering if anyone else had recommendations for what classes I should take in the summer if I do get into my major. Starting in the autumn, I'll be set to take AA310, AA311, AA320 and the undergraduate seminar class. Do you think it would be too hard to take AMATH301 with all these classes? And do all these A&A classes have exams or are they more project focused? I was also thinking about taking ME123 at some point and figured I might be able to take it in the autumn of I don't end up doing AMATH301.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bx6xo5/aa_4_year_plan_junior/,3,2

Here are some of my questions:

-Does each bedroom have a TV or is that just a gimmick in the online pictures? I see them installed in my floor plan but i’m not too sure.

-Do the units have Air Conditioning? I know many other student living buildings do. 

-Follow up to the last question: If no, are the windows compatible for air conditioners? Like those standalone units with the tube that goes to the window😅

-Are there rules regarding hanging stuff on the wall? I know I could check my lease but it’s so huge to go through😭🙏

-Can we have our own internet installed (Xfinity, Etc)? Can I bring my own wifi router to plug into the building wifi?

-How is cell service in the building? I have Verizon.

1bwq4vs,Uncomfortable spending at the District Market ,"so I’m a first year student living on west campus and I’ve been having real problems spending all of my dining money per quarter.

I use a cane as a mobility aid and have to get a basket if I pick up more than like 2 items—I constantly have people walk into me or avoid me because of my cane and the fact that I can’t walk normally like everyone else. it’s difficult for me to get the motivation/energy around my chronic pain and classes to go in the first place and I’m constantly really nervous and uncomfortable there.

Not only that but when I go, I go for my weekly groceries because it’s difficult to go every day—and the employees constantly comment on how much I am buying? But I have to, otherwise they won’t give me a bag and I have to struggle to get my groceries back to my dorm. One time, I brought my own bag and they rushed me to get out of there— so much so that while I was trying to put my groceries in my bag (one handed—again, it’s difficult to do things standing with my cane in the other hand supporting me), I dropped a thing of blueberries and had to pick them up by myself, crying and in pain, while another student shoved around me to check out where MY GROCERIES WERE STILL SITTING.

The north campus Dm is even worse, because they DO NOT even have baskets at all. Imagine if I was living there and just needed to get more than the two items I can carry in one arm!

Rant about how the DM treats students aside, I would love some advice on how to spend my dining money more effectively while combating my disabilities (mental and physical), pain, and social anxiety.

[edit/update: it's the end of the day and turns out a good lunch can really fix your attitude about things </3 thanks for the tips and kind words!!

**School: UCSB Vs UW**

US News Rank: 35 Vs 40

Acceptance Rate: 29% Vs 46%

Total Cost Per Year: 40k Vs 60k (oos)

Location: Beach Town Vs Big City

Student-Faculty Ratio: 17:1 Vs 21:1

Overall, UCSB appears better in every meaningful statistic, however, the specific program is what I am more curious about. In 2023, UW Foster's starting salary for undergrads was 76.6k in 2023 with a 94% placement after 3 months, and the average signing bonus was 8.5k. This makes it significantly better than UW overall.

On the other hand, UCSB Pre-Economics & Accounting major has very little data available online and feels like a bit more of a gamble. Does anyone have any data on UCSB accounting major? I am leaning towards Foster since their MBA is ranked 20th on US news (which is still relevant to the undergraduate program) and since I have concrete data on outcomes. Some data on UCSB's accounting/econ program and any possible first-hand experience would be super helpful before making a decision.

Extra: I have also been waitlisted by Michigan and UCSD and was wondering how they would stack up in case I am offered a spot.

Kelley pros-


1. Great placements + internship opportunities (placements records are public in a detailed manner, I like the transparency)

2. Prestige (t10 undergrad bschool)


Kelley cons-


1. Bloomington is really pretty but I'm afraid I'm a city girl

2. I wasn't impressed with the startup culture there (I went through their Accelerator website, pitching competition winners, company websites etc etc)

3. I've never lived in a snowy climate but I don't think I'll like it 


Udub pros-

1. LOVE the entrepreneurial culture in udub (very abundant) and in Seattle

2. Seattle ☀️🌊🤩


Udub cons


1. Health and biology heavy startups (A LOT of startups in udub are related to the medical field culminating in a strong medical startup community. I might have a hard time earning funding? )

2. Seattle 🔪🔫😨 (I live in a crime heavy city so ik the works but as an intl student, my parents would be stressed about me choosing seattle over a safe place like bloomington)

3. The placements records are very unspecific and I'm unsure whether foster could get me the internships which Kelley can. Avg salary of graduates is basically the same for both but foster graduates work in wa, ca, etc whereas Kelley graduates work in IL, IN, etx so the col varies by a lot.

4. Seattle has very short days during the winters

1bous3m,4 year to CC transfer question,"After not getting direct admit to my major uw in high school i decided to go to another washington 4 year university but after doing some research i found out those who went to community college have a high of getting into their major at uw. so i decided that i'm going to take cc over this spring and summer quarter. because of all the ap exams i took i have almost 90 credits already so i will have two years worth of coursework after two quarters at cc. However, the issues is that, when i was at the 4 year university i did pretty bad in my classes and now my gpa now is really bad. the question i have is whether or not uw will look at my gpa from the 4 year university and factor that into the admission process? hypothetically let's say i get a 4.0 in all my community college classes will i still get rejected because of the my bad grades at the 4 year university or will they ignored those classes.",Admissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bous3m/4_year_to_cc_transfer_question/,7,3

My strategy was to order each place's black milk tea with tapioca as a default baseline. This doesn't cover other types of tea like green tea, fruit tea, or any unique flavors that might make a place stand out, so if any of you have specific recommendations for these please let me know! I may expand/adjust my spreadsheet over time as I try more from these places, hence why I'm sending a link instead of a screenshot.

Tastes will be subjective and you may not agree with my reviews, and I am not claiming to be a boba expert by any means.

I’m at the beginning of my UX/UI journey (taken some courses and have some education in graphic design) and trying to learn more about this certification and see if it’s worth pursuing.

For those of you who have taken it, do you feel like it covered the essentials skills needed for the field? Was it any help for your job prospects? Did it provide opportunities for projects for your portfolio?

I know that a certificate alone is never enough to enter this field, as it’s all about the portfolio and skills, but I’m looking to see if this is a good starting point to learn the fundamentals in a structured environment. 

Also, can anyone verify that this isn’t run by those for-profit bootcamps that just cash in on the university’s name? I know this is a common practice with university certificates but I can’t find evidence of this for this certificate, which hopefully means it’s run by UW itself.

1bktagc,Frat Help,"Hi all,

I was hoping to get an opinion. I was part of a frat and during mid-quarter, I had to drop out due to complicated medical issues that were carrying on before I even dropped my fraternity. Up until the point I dropped out, I stopped attending events due to my medical concerns. However, even though I dropped they are still trying to get me to pay dues even though they never took me off of the chapter roster after I declared my drop to my president.

Is there any way I can get out of this? I don't think it's reasonable for me to pay a quarter's worth of dues if I never even benefited from being a part of the frat due to my health concerns. And even after I dropped, they never took me off the roster which seems a little sketchy to me.

1bksjmo,[21 Month Update] <2.5 GPA Foster Reject Applies To Husky 100!,"**Previous Posts:**

\[Post 2\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/s/ZwhFJWRUea](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/s/ZwhFJWRUea))

\[Post 3\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/s/SoW3RRHfy6](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/s/SoW3RRHfy6))

&#x200B;

**TL;DR For Previous Posts:** Applied to Foster twice with a low GPA and didn't get in. A lot more goes in to it, but that's the gist of it. My goal is now to get into grad school (Not Foster).

**TL;DR For This Post:** Did two internships, rejected both return offers. Going all in, full speed on my pipe dreams. Husky 100 info at the end. 

Since absolutely no one asked for this, I thought I'd give an update on what I've been upto for all zero people who were waiting for this!

I told myself I wouldn't make an update before something significant happens, and in reality, the saga would be a lot more interesting if I made this post later this fall but when I looked at the last post I made and saw it was 21 months ago I thought maybe I'll post an update now so it doesn't become an even longer post later.

To say I was devastated after what took place in my last post is an understatement. My morale was down in the toilet the entire summer after everything happened, and to be honest, it still pisses me off every time I think about the entire situation, and it pains me even more because, at the end of the day, I put myself in that situation in the first place and I got no one else to blame for it.

I said in my last post I was going to study for the GMAT, but Mental health was nonexistent at the time, and I just couldn't do it so I put it on the back burner (more on that later).

When Fall quarter came around, I was trying to cope with being back at square zero and decided to get my mind off it as much as I could by getting more involved on campus (I think I've doxed myself enough, so I'm leaving it at that)

I don't know what took over me, having had zero hope for internships after what happened to the last one, but I decided to send out two applications for summer 2023 internships, with one of them being a long shot and the other one being a little more of a reasonable reach for me.

I ended up getting a first-round interview a week after my application. A week later, I was invited for a final round interview, and a day later, I got an offer! I accepted it, I think, a week or two later, but honestly, I didn't count on it much after what happened last time, and I had my expectations at zero this time before I was behind my desk, which was nine months away.

This is a story for a different day, but although by all measures, this internship would be a dream for many people with amazing benefits and pay right out of school, it's not what I want to do ultimately, so I wasn't going to call it done here.

That was my fall 2022 quarter. Nothing really happened in Winter and Spring 2023 except two somewhat small things, which I won't mention, although they are kind of relevant to what I want to do later, because if I haven't doxed myself yet, I'll definitely do it by mentioning them! I'll say this, though: They look good on a resume for some brownie points, that's all.

When the Summer quarter came around, I started my internship, and it was a great experience. I didn't accept a full-time offer, though. I still want to do a master's, and as I said earlier, it's not my top choice for a career.

Right after my internship ended, I sent out a handful of applications for Winter 2024 internships at other firms. Within one week, I was invited for an interview for a similar internship at a much larger firm for which I got an offer 4h after my interview. I'm going to leave this one at that, and I'm intentionally being vague because UW Bothell has 5k students on a good day, and I'm definitely doxing myself at this point if I say anything else.

By every measure and metric in the universe, this internship would be a dream for anyone looking to make a career in the said field, but as I mentioned before, that field isn't the end goal for me, so this is not where I'm calling my journey done either, and I did not accept my return offer. Honestly, in this job market, this was a hard choice and a super risky move that may come back to bite me later, but we will see. (yes, I am stressing!)

&#x200B;

**Other Updates:**

* Back to the GMAT studying, masters is still very much something I'm thinking about and again I have to be vague here but the plan is to study for it sometime between now and end of the year as I'm planning to apply in 2024-2025 application cycle.
* My GPA is now above 3.0 from the less than 2.5 that it once was. I have straight 4.0s, but as you can imagine, moving the needle on the number of credits I have is not easy.
* I got into a summer program for 2024 (Being vague to not dox myself) which I would like to believe it was at least somewhat competitive with the average GPA being a 3.7 last year but who knows.
* I got a small scholarship which was kind of fun! It felt good to be recognized for something after all of this. But I also got rejected for two much larger schoolarships which really stung.

**Onto What You Are All Here For:** It comes with great displeasure to inform you all I have not been selected for the Husky 100. 

* Am I sadge? Yes. 
* Do I want to talk about it? No.
* Did I spend 6 hours a day for 3 weeks reliving the worst years of my life crying a river and writing my essay while doing my internship in January? Yes. 
* Will I apply again next year? No. Can't get sadge a second time if you don't try again in the first place.
* Do I feel like all this effort was for nothing? Absolutely!

That's all for now. Season Finale dropping Fall 2024! Either I get into a Master's program or into my local McDonalds as a janitor. Whatever happens, that will be the last update on this. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bksjmo/21_month_update_25_gpa_foster_reject_applies_to/,12,13

For context, I'm an international student who got accepted into UW College of Arts and Sciences for the year 2024. However, I would be deferring admission as I am serving in the army and will be joining in 2025.  

Upon researching on the UW website the undergrad tuition for nonresident is 40k while the total cost of attendance is about 64k. I'm guessing this implies the majority of the remaining 20k is housing. So I've been looking for ways to make it more affordable for me by trying alternative options for residency other than living in the college dorms. 

So my question is basically how are some of the ways I can reduce cost, Maybe by renting my apartment and sharing or something? Also, what are the rates and renting scenes like around the college? I would preferably like a spot closer to campus as I don't have a car and don't see myself traveling super far to get tot college. 

Any help would be appreciated. Feel free to Dm me too.

1bkp5gk,Why the fascination with Ivys over CS at UDub,"Unless  the CS rankings on USNews and other sites are totally messed up, the way I look at it is that besides MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU and UIUC, every other college is ranked lower for CS. And looking beyond the rankings, I see so many other tangible advantages that aren’t taken into account in the rankings - like UDub’s proximity to all the amazing companies in Seattle - Amazon, Meta, Google, the endowments from Pauly boy and BillyG, the guest lectures by Distinguished Scientists from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others, the wealth of nearby companies to intern at who don’t have to pay for your accommodation in this tight market, the startup scene, and the constantly rising bar of incoming CS Freshman, mostly gene-gifted kids of the sea of software engineer parents in the Puget Sound and beyond. I think UDub CS has an amazing future.

Yet I see this intense fascination with the lesser ranked Ivies and non-Ivies. Are these folks mere brand name chasers who want bragging rights, and/or have been conditioned to think that way by their helicopter parents, or am I missing something else. Do they not know about the CS ranking? Have they just given up on UDUb as out of staters, given its heavy preference for instaters?

Rain City Book Bowl is a joint collaboration between Head in the Clouds Trivia and Quizbowl at the University of Washington. Our goal is to connect book nerds in Seattle by giving them a fun competitive outlet! This league will recur monthly in bookstores around the Seattle area.

Our trial run will be held at the HUB on UW campus. You can expect the event to be a hybrid of Head in the Clouds bar trivia and quizbowl. If you're unfamiliar with either or both of these question styles, no worries! We'll be explaining everything during the event, and I can answer questions in the comments of this post :)

Team size is capped at 4. No teammates? No problem! When you buy your tickets, you can also request to be placed on a team with other players. We hope that this will be a fun way to meet other Seattle readers!

We will be testing your knowledge of both old and new books, so our event will have an equal amount of questions about each. The genres covered will vary, but you can expect to be asked about classic books, sci-fi / fantasy, romance, poetry, and biography / nonfiction.

I'm coming to Seattle this summer to intern at Amazon. They recommend renting dorms at unis in Seattle (incl UW), so I thought I could ask some questions here:
1. Dorms are ~70/day depending on the college. Is it possible to find a sublease cheaper (I don't really care about the place as long as it's not infested)
2. Which college is most near the Amazon office? What about best location to explore Seattle? 
3. Is it worth bringing a car? Or is Seattle walkable like European cities? I wanna explore the town (and nature, I heard it's very beautiful), but perhaps the car is so much not worth it that I should rather rent whenever I go somewhere?

1bk8q4s,UW Honors or Cal Poly (political science),"So I was accepted into both, but I'm really struggling with the choice. I was accepted into others too, but I'm planning on going to law school after my degree so I didn't think it made too much sense to spend all of my or my parent's money on undergrad. 

Finances:

I'm a Washington resident and live literally 15 minutes away from the UW so that's a plus. The in-state tuition is about 8k-12k last time I checked, with housing and other shit obviously bringing it up a bit. Cal Poly is about 28k out of state.

Location:

I live in Seattle and I pass the UW all the time. It's a beautiful school but I guess I don't get that ""new"" feeling. But don't get me wrong, it's a great location. The Burke Gilman bike trail is literally right next to it, and I can see my family often. Cal Poly is better weather though. I don't actually like the Cal Poly campus itself, but the surrounding greenery and mountains are fucking incredible. And my cousin goes there so...

Academics:

So in terms of academics, I think the UW is probably going to be better for pols sci, especially because I got into the honors college, but I don't really know. I mean...Cal Poly literally had ""polytechnic"" in the name and that's not really my jam

Running Start:

I'm a running start student meaning by the time I graduate high school I will have my AA degree and 90 college credits. The UW is 100% going to accept all of them. I don't know about Cal Poly, I haven't called yet.

The College ""Experience""

So I've heard from some people the UW has a great social life but then some say it's crap. Iv'e heard the same about Cal Poly. I think both communities will have people who love exploring the outdoors like me because Seattle is generally super outdoorsy. So is Cal Poly though. 

&#x200B;

Iv'e always wanted to live in california but heres how I see it: theres no reason for me to spend around 50k more on Cal Poly, I got into UW honors, UW is pretty too in a different way, and I can always go to California for law school, my gap year after I get my degree, or I can study abroad for a quarter or two.

The only concern I have for the UW is if they'll let me declare my major. Iv'e heard that it takes two years to declare, but since I already have 90 credits, will they just let me declare immediately? Or maybe they'll never let me??

Thanks!

Is it realistic for me to secure a spot in the next offered Math334 course?

Does me being fresh out of highschool affect my performance in a good or bad way for the course? (I.e. would it be harder to transition into UW/general universify if I were to take the course, do you guys reccomend the sequence for basically a Freshman with college credits)

(For math majors): Is the course beneficial for a math major, or is it better for Physics students interested in advanced math concepts? It seems like the topics go by fast, so would it be more beneficial for me to take the math major requirements separately rather than taking them through this class?

1bjx40u,Professor Unresponsive About Grade,"To preface, I know that the quarter is over, and I know it's annoying when students try to get their grades raised after they've been submitted. But I also feel like it's the professor's responsibility to communicate expectations clearly and grade fairly.

With that out of the way, here is the situation: I took AMATH 482/582 with Prof. Shlizerman this past quarter, and did pretty good for the most part. However, on the last assignment I got a 12/20, which was a pretty big shock to me as I thought I had done everything required. A look at the rubric (which was not available before the homework was submitted, iirc) tells me that they graded me down for omitting things that were not specified as required (or even mentioned) on the actual homework. Additionally, I was given 0 points for several things that I did actually do. There was no feedback on why I missed these points. From the class discord, I know at least a few other people were graded much more harshly than they were expecting. I sent a canvas message to the professor and the two TAs (one of whom graded my assignment) last night and have not gotten a response. From what other students have told me, the professor has been pretty bad about responding to emails this quarter, and I'm worried I'm not even going to get a response. 

I don't know if getting these points back would change my final grade (he didn't give us a grade scale), and honestly I'm not too upset with my current grade anyway. At this point I honestly just want someone to listen to my concerns and clarify what I did wrong. Is there anything I can do in this situation?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bjx40u/professor_unresponsive_about_grade/,15,22

1biqzti,Rate my path (ECE Community Transfer),"Hey guys, I'm a senior in highschool. After a stone cold rejection letter, I started researching alternative pathways for me to take, and where UW might fit into a hypothetical pathway. An appeal a day keeps the regrets away, but I must take a realistic adult stance.

I always knew the community college transfer route is a great path, but further research made it seem like it's in fact an amazing path. [Data from UW](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/transfer/ctc-admissions-data) seems to show that almost 70% of transfer applicants are accepted into UW. Among that 70%, it seems that 89% who apply into Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) are accepted? (if I'm interpreting the stats correctly)

If this is true, I feel that this should be a great path to take. After making sure that my community college has the pre-req courses necessary for the ECE major, **do you guys think community college is the way to go? Any advice or people who have gone down a similar path?**

The main thing keeping me from attending another 4-year is cost savings. Not just living from home, but my lenient chill job pays me $24/hour, so staying home while keeping that job could have great financial outcomes. Plus, it seems that as long as I maintain good performance in terms of GPA and activities, I may have an excellent chance at ECE.

Also side question: does UW prioritize certain community colleges over other colleges? The college within my bounds is Olympic College in Bremerton, WA.

1biejlz,Do high CSE 142/143 grades make up for lower Calculus grades for the comp sci school?,"A little background info:

I'm applying as a transfer student after returning to school to finish my comp sci prerequisites. I was self-taught prior to this, so I tested out of CSE 141, got a 3.9 in CSE 142, and expect to get a 3.9 this quarter for CSE 143. My Precalculus was 4.0 and I expect to get a 3.3 for Calc I this quarter. My overall GPA is around 3.6 and I'm shooting for 3.82 GPA for Fall-Spring '24.

Can anyone say whether the Paul G Allen School favors higher CSE grades, or would my CSE and MATH grades have equal weight?

Another bit of valuable info: Due to a mixup by Shoreline, I wasn't able to start Calc I until Winter quarter, meaning I'll still be lacking the Calc III necessary for Paul G Allen School. However, my credits will satisfy UWT's CS program by the end of Spring '24, so I may have to attend UWT instead. I also had a rough high school experience and dropped out with a 1.6 GPA at 16.

I'm a junior entering my spring quarter, and I'm currently in MCD and hoping to go to medical school. My current gpa is about a 3.71. I transferred here this autumn from UWB and got into my major this Winter quarter. 

My problem is that I've found that I simply don't enjoy MCD the way I thought that I would, and I have been taking health humanities courses (health ethics, health disparities) and have found that I genuinely love them, and I get really excited about taking similar courses. For this reason, I want to switch to global health. I feel like investing in something I'm passionate about and genuinely enjoy will make my undergrad far less misery inducing. 

My problem is that I have changed my mind really, really late. But I've also taken enough humanities courses that fit into the global health (BS) major that I'm actually technically further along the gh track than I am for MCD. I'm completely willing to take a fifth year of classes and to graduate late just to be in this major. I really think that I can be successful studying global health (I've gotten a 3.9-4.0 in every related course). 

I have strong healthcare experience (have volunteered at the ER for six months and have volunteered at health clinics aimed at underserved populations since the age of 14). I know that I can do a minor in global health, but I'd really like to major in it and I want to know if I actually have a chance and if its worth trying to switch over. 

Is it in any way possible that they would admit me? I understand that certain programs have some sort of a timeline in place and that they're less likely to accept you sometimes.

Not to trauma dump, but for a fuller a picture, in my junior year my dad died which messed up my grades quite a bit. I am a running start student and from what I remember I got one N/C, one D, and one C-. The rest were A's and B's. GPA dropped from 4.0 to I believe a 3.6. 

With those grades I still somehow managed to get accepted for Marine Bio for the 2024 Autumn quarter. 

With that this year has been equally a struggle (due to some extra family issues that were caused from my dads passing) I got two C's fall quarter and I believe I will either be getting a D or an N/C (depending on which I decide to take) and a B for winter quarter. My GPA, without winter quarters grades, is currently a 3.4. 

I have reason to believe that the rest of this year I will get A's and B's as all I'm really taking next quarter are PE classes because that's I still need for grad credits. 

I've talked to my therapist and she says she'll write a letter explaining my current situation which we have reason to believe will improve considerably after I move to college. 

I am fully aware that I messed up big and this is fully on me, no excuses. I know that I will probably get a letter asking what happened. What I really want to know is what has it taken for people to get rescinded in the past and how screwed am I really?

I am a current UW sophomore who is applying to the School of Engineering for MechE, CivE, EnvE, and A&A this spring. 

I’ve been told differing opinions from peers whether I have a good chance of getting a spot in engineering. Although I will have prerequisites done in time, my grades are lower than where I want them to be ~3.2-.4 range and unfortunately do not have any engineering rso experience yet.

I have been working in building a portfolio of projects in programs such as solidworks, ansys, and python/matlab in hopes to make up for this and to show my application of what I’ve learned in class to my own personal interests.

I have come here ask if for any advice or recommendations for an alternative major in case I don’t get in or any other candid advice regarding my situation. 

I have been having difficulty in feeling hopeful that I will get in and it’s driven me into a pretty poor mental spiral so I greatly appreciate anything that helps me gain a little bit of peace of mind.

In the spring, winter, and possibly summer quarters. However, when I took Accounting this past winter quarter, I realized that Business is not something I wanted to pursue, and I don't want to take them. However, this world be a discrepancy in what I said and what I did. Also I had to drop out of accounting this winter (GPA dd not get affected but did show as a W in the transcript) due to family concerns.

To off set this I will try to be taking more math classes and Data Science classes as that is what I want to pursue later on in college as well.

In terms of OOS affordability, wtf is the deal? I got $4200 from the Purple and Gold scholarship, so that covers a tiny bit (tysm so so generous 😭) but what am I looking at for total cost? I would look into this on my own but i’m honestly so confused on varying sticker prices. I have around 60k (probably a little less) in college savings, but I know that’s not going to cover all four years, maybe not even one. Does the university give any more money based on the FAFSA? Or am I totally screwed? My FAFSA is already messed up because the 2022 information is before my father quit his job and went off the deep-end leaving me in a single income divorced family situation so idk the expected contribution. I think my mom makes around 100k a year but she really only got our house and the cars in the divorce so there’s not a ton of equity there. 

With the financial context set, assuming UW is even an option, how does applying to majors work? This quirky system scares me because I am wholly unsure of my future career and major. I like political science but would probably go to law school after because there’s not a lot of jobs there (especially that pay well). I also like biology and anthropology but don’t want to be in academia. I’m hoping that I’ll find a career that pairs my interests in a way that also pays off my debt lmfao. With my uncertainty in mind, wtf do I do my freshman year. It seems like you have to be proactive about taking prereqs for the majors and that they’re competitive and I feel like it’ll be hard to compete when I literally don’t know where I’ll be competing.

This is a more general question about college trade-offs, but is it really worth it to go somewhere that feels boring and unfulfilling if it’s the cheapest option? I got into UMN with honors (I’d have little to no debt there), but it’s only 5 hours from home and I need to get out of the midwest lol. I also found out my ex is going there and I honestly feel like my growth would be stunted if I’m surrounded in the same environment that I’m trying to escape right now. That sounds a little dramatic but the past two years of my life have been hell and this girl embodies all of that suffering lol. Also, this is 100% an ego thing, but I’ve worked so hard and academics have been the foundation of my self worth my whole life and I’m going to be dissapointed if I end up at a college half of my HS class goes to.

What it's about: all of the dirty laundry that gets aired by genetic tests like 23andme and AncestryDNA. We'll talk about how it's a paternity test not just for you but all your relatives, finding relatives, finding relatives of serial killers to solve cold cases,  ancestry analysis at many levels and surprises, including about how race and ethnicity are not the same thing, about dodgy marketing of products and eating disorders, about intersex surprises, about health interpretations that people stumble into, and about reproductive implications, with detours for ranting about ablism and homophobia and transphobia and racism and cultural appropriation with the ability to get credit for it. 

Who it's for: 

* anyone who has wanted to do a direct-to-consumer genetic test or has done one or has relatives who have done one
* premeds who are going to be seeing patients wielding their test results
* anyone who wants a 5 credit course that meets Natural World Credit and Social Science distribution requirements in a fun and approachable way
* anyone who wants to get a fairly easy, fun good grade in their spring quarter *without any exams ,* with flexibility about lecture attendance vs asynchronous viewing, and with assignments that are largely done in discussion section

I eventually worked up through a Master's and turned out just fine. Yeah, I didn't get the UW experience for a couple years but I don't know if that is worth however many thousand dollars.

1bg1dj8,admitted to pre-sciences at uw but got rejected for cs dtm. need advice.,"i applied to cs at uw, and unfortunately i didn't get into cs at allen. i need help because i was strongly considering attending uw. it's risky to attend uw if the chances of transfer from pre-sciences to cs are slim. i had the following questions and i'd appreciate if someone can help with these.

\- how realistic are the chances of transferring from pre-sciences to cs?  
\- how does the transfer process work? when would i transfer in the year? what classes would i take in my first year?  
\- is pre-science a major in itself from which i transfer to cs or do i pick another major first and then transfer from that to cs or get stuck with that major forever?  
\- if the latter, then what majors do i pick for the best chances of transfer to cs? can i pick acms from pre-sciences? the website says that acms is capacity constrained - does this mean that if they've also  admitted people dtm already, it's gonna be insanely hard to get in?? i wouldn't want to be stuck with microbiology since that's the only science major that's not capacity constrained. alternatively, can i pick a major from the college of engineering or the college of information when i got into pre-sciences.  
\- and finally, if i don't even get accepted to cs in transfer, can i transfer to electrical and computer engineering or computer science and engineering? how easy is it to transfer to either of these majors instead?

1bf5d5j,PSA for Admitted First Years about Majors,"Congratulations all incoming huskies! 

Every year there is some confusion about majors and applying to UW, and I’m seeing some of that here, so I hope this can clear some things up.

When you applied for UW and selected your intended major, if you are admitted that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re actually in the major. Only a select number of majors have the potential for incoming first years to be directly admitted, and those are listed at the attached link. MOST majors at UW do not allow for direct admit, so if you selected any of those majors on your application as your intended major and were admitted, you were admitted to UW as major undeclared, and may be noted as “pre-major”, “pre-sciences”, “pre-health”, or “pre-art” in your portal, all of these mean you don’t have a major.

Psychology for example does not have direct admit, so if you selected psychology and were admitted, you are not actually IN the psychology major. You would need to look up psychology’s pre-requisites, complete those courses, and apply once you’re here. Some majors are selective and competitive to get into, some only have minimum requirements that as long as you complete those you’re admitted, and some majors are open, meaning there are no pre-reqs and you can declare at any time.

Please just be aware during your planning for your first year that there are some steps you may need to take in order to actually get into your major, and plan to take those pre-reqs as soon as possible. UW is different than other schools that will typically admit you into your major when you’re admitted to the school, but UW more often than not will admit only to the school and not directly to any major. 

I hope this clears some things up!

1bf1blq,Spacious room for rent in Ravenna neighborhood [AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY],"Hi guys! I am moving home after this quarter and am looking for someone to take over my room because my house's lease goes through August.

The house is located in the Ravenna neighborhood, about a 20 minute walk from campus. It is right next to a stop on the 67 bus line and about a 5 minute walk from the Roosevelt Link station. You would have 6 other roommates in the house, who are all males. Most of them are athletes at UW, so you end up having the house to yourself a fair bit. The house is spacious and has a large kitchen upstairs as well as a nice living room with couches and a TV to hangout in.

As for specifics to the room, it is generously sized and already partially furnished. There is a queen size bed/mattress, a dresser, a desk, and a large garment rack that I would be willing to pass along. The room is downstairs in the house, and right next to a separate kitchen area with an oven, stove, fridge, and sink that myself and one other roommate have to ourselves. The room is also across the hall from a full bathroom that is also shared between myself and one other roommate.

As put in the title, the room is also available immediately. March rent is already paid for, so if you wanted to move in next week you would end up getting half a month or so for free. Rent comes out to about $1000 per month, including utilities. There is actually another room in the house that's going to be available soon as well, so if anyone wanted to move in with a friend we would probably be able to make that work.

Extra curriculars: 4 years of Varsity basketball & track, where I was captain for both sports during 2 of the years. AAU circuit basketball for 4 years. Music Studio Internship. I worked at a construction company. I worked at a restaurant. I volunteered. And I did a foreign exchange program in Costa Rica.

I am very confident in my personal statement because of the high grade I earned on my personal statement assignment from my ENGL 101 teacher who is notorious for being a very harsh grader. I got one of the best scores in my school.

I explained in the additional essay that the reason why my GPA is so low, is because I failed 4 classes in the second semester of 10th grade. This was due to my father passing away, and my brother being sent to a psychiatric ward for schizophrenia due to him being very violent.

On top of this, when I came back to school in 11th grade, I earned straight A’s in all of my classes. And prior to second semester of 10th grade, I was a A/ High B student.

I mean, I have been here for 3 years and I had to look up her name. I have zero awareness of any contribution she has made but would like to know if she has. Even if she has made great contributions, over $1 million annually just doesn’t sit right with me considering the president of the entire country has a combined income of around $500,000. Also, grad and post-grad students recently protesting for wage increases while the president collects a million dollars seems far too polarizing for a university that strives to be progressive and fair. The grads and post grads make up a huge chunk of the workforce and the success, or lack thereof, of the workforce, should be factored into the presidents salary.

1b8m02g,Did anyone lose a red and blue possibly torrent shell rain jacket around February 12?,"I got it at the HUB Lost and Found sale today, wondering if anyone has lost a red and blue jacket (looks like a Patagonia torrent shell) - men's size L. 

There was a HUB Motosurf receipt in the pocket; there's no info on who the purchaser was, but there is a date on it, which is Feb 12, 2024. 

Seems kind of recent for the HUB to put it on sale already (I thought the things they put on sale would have been sitting in the lost and found for much longer, at least two quarters or something but I guess not), so if we find out whose it was, I'm happy to return it to the owner!

Here is a pic of the receipt, if you think it was yours maybe check your Husky account on Feb 12th and see if it matches.

1b865ed,Taking a quarter off as an international student,"Could any one of you guys tell me if I can take a quarter off after having been enrolled in the previous quarter? I have taken courses from Fall, Winter quarter but want to take time off in the Spring quarter because I am enrolled here at Queen's. I hope to start at UW from Summer quarter if possible. Is this allowed for an international student? Thank you guys so much!

But I wanted to enroll at Udub so much that I instead took several online courses for the Fall and Winter quarter. It has been some of the best courses I have ever taken even if they were online. I really enjoyed the format and the quality of the courses.

Luckily for me, I applied to both American and Canadian institutions at that time. I was also accepted by Queen's University in Canada. And during the time when I took the online courses from UW, I successfully received my Canadian student visa, which is kind of a relief for me.

But for me Queen's University is good but it is not like Udub which has a superiority in STEM and CS over almost all universities you can imagine(excluding some top schools, like Stanford, and Berkeley). I still hope to go there. And that is why I kept taking online courses from UW while I was registered at another University. I still have the opportunity to transfer here without filling out a returning student form or reapply.

So my attended major is computer science and i’ve gotten a start on my prereqs but i think i screwed myself over. for what ever reason i wanted to take my programming classes at seattle (via cross campus enrollment) and man did i get greeted by horrors. I want to get into the cs major in tacoma but it turns out the programming classes i took in seattle (cse 121 and cse 122) might not even satisfy the prereqs back in tacoma (tcss 142 and tcss 143). For the tcss 143 course the prereqs is the complimentary course below it (tcss 142) or cse 142 in the seattle campus, and as we all know that’s not available anymore. As for the prereqs for tcss 142 I still need to pass calc 1 which i unfortunately failed last quarter. The plan i thought up with might be either asking my counselor if me taking cse 122 might satisfy the tcss 143 prereq or just getting calc 1 over with this spring followed by taking tcss 142 + calc 2 in the summer and tcss 143 in the fall.

Still early days but worth a shot to see if anything is available!

I'm a 20M medical student from the United Kingdom and Canada who is doing a summer stint for research at UW Roosevelt at University District. Timeline isn't 100% but I plan on coming around Mid-May to the end of August. 

Would consider myself more reserved, but would massively prefer to live with others as I've heard it's pretty lonely if you don't know anyone, lol (and 21+ alcohol is a toughie), and I do like to go out from time to time. However, I plan on spending most my time in the lab or studying, so there's no issue if you want a quieter flatmate. I don't have any preference with gender, age etc and am fine living with undergrads or professionals/graduates. 

Budget is $1200 or under, but am flexible. Preferably a <15 minute walk away from Roosevelt Hospital/Main Campus.

Secondly, how long does UW take to evaluate transfer credits?  The other schools I'm applying to require a decision by June 1, is the evaluation likely to be done by then?  The amount of classes granted could make a big decision on whether or not I go to UW.

I’m left handed, and whenever there are exams in lecture halls without assigned seats, I am reminded that many people do not process that left side aisle seats have left handed desks. People seem to favor aisle seats so if I don’t get there right away, all the leftie desks are filled. During lectures, most people use laptops for notes so it’s not an issue, but with exams it’s ever so slightly annoying. My options are to either have an unnecessarily awkward writing position for the exam, or to have to ask someone “are you left handed?” and ask them to move when they say no fwhich in my experience, they always do). I wouldn’t be as bothered if the two outcomes weren’t always a) the person seeming awkward and embarrassed or b) the person looking at me like I just spoke an alien language.

I'm pursuing applied mathematics and am on my second year of CC, hoping to transfer to UW for winter 2025. I switched my major halfway through, and there will be like 2 prerequisites that I won't be able to finish in time by the application. 

That being said, I would still like to transfer to UW and do the rest of my prerequistes there before I apply into the math department instead of staying at home and finishing the prereqs at CC. 

Does UW take in transfer students as pre-majors or will I have to finish all prereqs at CC and then apply directly into the major?

I know CS is a no go if you don't get DA but if you're a student interested in Informatics or IS in the foster school is it stupid going to UW over UWB.

My main fear with UWB is that I've heard it's a really socially dead school. I don't care for the party scene I just want to meet cool people and be in a school where culture clubs have a good community that meets often.

 My big problem with general admission is that I am a running start student with all my info pre reqs done and most my business ones are too so I'm not sure what I would do at UW if they don't admit me into my major. If anyone has experience with this, I would love to know.

I know CS is a no go if you don't get DA but if you're a student interested in Informatics or IS in the foster school is it stupid going to UW over UWB.

I just want a change of environment that UW would give me and to meet all kinds of people in a bigger environment and I feel like UWB's atmosphere might not provide that, but I would love to hear everyone's thoughts.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1av2af2/is_uwb_a_lonely_or_depressing_place_to_be/,2,0

If you guys have your writing gen ed left, I would recommend taking ESS 101 for it in Spring. The writing portion is an essay on top of the normal assignments. I found it to be more interesting and fun compared to a typical English writing course. The class size is big so there will be a chance for everyone to register (online & in person). You won't need prior Geology knowledge to do well. If you have a high workload next quarter, this is a great class to sign up for. Professor Swanson is also the most enthusiastic prof I have had so far; no lectures are boring! You do one lab a week, a short reading, and there are two exams. There are also field trips and other extra credit assignments!

1at6ffd,Student Leadership Opportunity: Helping Homeless Communities,"Hi everyone! Wanted to share more about a leadership opportunity for those interested:

**Hearts for the Homeless International** is a student-led nonprofit organization that provides free blood-pressure screening opportunities and heart health education to homeless populations around the United States and globally. We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity! 

We are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.

The work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well. Some of our other significant achievements include leading an effort to rescue the homeless in multiple cities from hurricanes, partnering with Shark Tank’s Bombas Socks, as well as being published by [Forbes Magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2017/11/06/how-young-leaders-are-strengthening-community-responses-to-disasters/#77391a361850). 

We want to be able to help serve the struggling community of unhoused individuals in Seattle. According to the most recent 2023 [Annual Homelessness Assessment Report](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2023-AHAR-Part-1.pdf), Seattle is ranked in the top 5 for major cities with the largest number of people experiencing homelessness.

Is ode now just a place to hang out now? has uw social life fallen that much?

1ar3c7q,"Given my unique situation, should I be putting my graduation date as March or June of 2024?","Hi all,

I’m a senior who will be graduating this year. I’m in a unique situation where this is my last “real” quarter of classes, as in my last quarter where I will be attending classes in-person. I have finished all of the requirements for my degree and major, and I could have technically applied to graduate after Winter quarter. However, I will be taking a full-time credit course load in the Spring for two reasons: to finish one of my two minors (only one class remaining) and to be able to receive an additional quarter of the generous financial aid that has essentially paid me to attend school. So, I will only be taking one class for one of my two optional minors I have added on, and the rest will just be fun and easy electives to hit the full time requirement for financial aid. 

All of these classes that I am taking are completely online, and my classes for Winter quarter will be concluding at the beginning of March. As a result, I have been looking for full-time jobs starting immediately since I have the availability to begin my career early, and to get a head start versus having to compete with many more people who also will be graduating in June.

Here’s my question: on my resume, I have been listing that I am graduating in March of 2024, since I will have technically met every single requirement for my degree, both general electives and my specific concentration, outside of the one optional minor. Furthermore, I am afraid if I list June that employers will think I am not available until then and would reject my application thinking I don’t have the availability to start right away. This is something that if granted initial interviews, I plan on clarifying right away that while I could technically have my degree, on paper I technically do not, given the reasons above, but that I will in 3 months. I don’t want to “deceive” anyone, but given my unique situation I think I am better off putting March and then explaining my situation if I am provided an interview

I guess what I’m trying to ask is, is this okay to do? Am I technically lying? I don’t want employers to possibly think I am trying to be deceitful or something of the sorts. I saw a TikTok about someone who lied and said they had a degree and they didn’t when they were technically 6 credits short. They had gone through 3 interviews without disclosing it, and had their offer rescinded as a result. I’m not sure if that person was still actively in school or not, but now it has left me paranoid. Should I be putting June instead, even though I am able to start right now? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

We are a lab in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences here at UW and we are looking for **MALE ADULTS (ages 18+)** to participate in some research studies. (We are specifically in need of AMAB participants right now, but all genders are welcome!)

In general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do NOT stutter for a variety of experiments in which you'll be compensated $20/hr. We can reimburse for street parking and we will provide you with a free hearing screening as part of the experiment.

Most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words or sentences off a screen. Some studies involve measuring your brain function while you wear an electrode cap (just like a swim cap). We have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

If you are interested, or have any questions at all, please email us at [maxlab@uw.edu](mailto:maxlab@uw.edu)!

Thank you!

1aq0mw7,Hiring speeds in ‘23-24,"I’ve already searched the history of this sub to see what the experience is like and saw that they were supposed to be revamping their system to improve it. Anyone know if that’s taken place yet and what the experience is like more recently?  If you’re written off as not a viable candidate do you at least get the rejection immediately or are you left in limbo until someone signs the offer letter. 

This is my second experience so far with their hiring process and I feel like it was much quicker the first time but then again it was for a lower titled position. 

History:

I applied back in April of last year for a position. Got the email for an interview 2 days later and they wanted to interview the next day. Ended up postponing the interview by one week because one day left little to no time to get in the mindset for one etc. 

I left the interview feeling confident that I was able to articulate why I would make a good candidate and almost immediately after (same day) the manager asked for my references. I was able to send my ref to them quickly and they contacted them first thing in the morning the following day. Unfortunately for me I also got a call from my doctor that I would need an emergency procedure (such awful timing) and that recovery and follow ups would take 3-4 months. Knowing how fast things were moving (interview, reference checks) I knew I had to withdraw immediately which I did. They understood and encouraged me to apply again if/when I was ready.

Flash forward to December ‘23. I have fully recovered and everything should be fine, just requires routine monitoring etc. I applied again but everything moving at a much slower pace this time around. I applied in December but I know how places work and things freeze usually in December, not sure how or why they even posted it. I heard back mid Jan and interviewed end of Jan (3 weeks ago). I left the interviewing feeling not as confident. Not sure what happened but definitely didn’t go as well as my one in April. They didn’t ask for references immediately at the end either and I wrote it off as them remembering having spoken to them already, or that I bombed. A week after the interview (2 weeks ago) they ask for my references and I send almost the same ones but I’ve added my medical director.  Only issue now is that they have yet to contact any of them?  Not sure if that’s a good sign or not?  They specifically told me they would contact all the candidates and notify them of the decision which I interpreted as please don’t bother me with follow-ups but I’d really like to know where I stand. My career is pretty niche especially for the PNW so my opportunities are slim so im pretty dead set on this one. 

I currently work at public health/learning institution so I’m familiar with slow and red tape issues but my current one is at least allowed to notify the candidate that the offer is coming it just takes time to draft it (unless my manager goofed).",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1aq0mw7/hiring_speeds_in_2324/,3,5

* Get into I'm a better person improving past my academic shortcomings... at the end I talk about how hopefully my parents can see me get accepted and maybe graduate will alive

While this is a sucky application I am banking on the personal statement and want thoughts on my chancesI will apply for the winter quarter which should be better with my 3.8 or around along with whatever happens in the summer quarter. If I am still not accepted, Wsu

1aot826,Geography Data Science: Everything You Need To Know,"Hello dawgs,

If you're reading this, you either didn't get into a major or you're a freak that likes maps. Either way, it's going to be okay. 

I'm writing this because there is a severe lack of student resources about the Geography Data Science major, and it is an open major which creates a lot of questions.  So from the coursework to the department to the career prospects, I am going to give you everything I know about being in GDS.

**How do you know if GDS is for you?** 

You need to have a passion for data visualization, coding, and maps. It is a great technical degree in a growing industry.

First of all, the Geography department is a relatively small department of students and faculty that is hidden on the fourth floor of Smith Hall. From what I've seen, Geography coursework is separated into two categories. Half of the classes are more humanities-based geography classes focused on the historical, political, and socio-economic aspects of geography. Highly interesting, but nothing technical. The other half are data science classes focused on developing maps with custom software and scripting languages.

Geography Data Science is a Bachelors of Science degree. An audit will require that you take a shit ton of 300 level Geography classes, intro CSE classes, and a machine learning course(s). 

**The classes I have taken in order of importance:**  
GEOG 360: intro mapping class focused on an open-source mapping software, QGIS. Somewhat tedious, maybe a little boring, but highly important.

GEOG 458: taught by the same prof as 328, another class that teaches more advanced techniques for geospatial web programming. The projects you build in this class can be pretty professional. HTML/CSS/Mapbox/ArcGIS API JS/Node.js/PostgreSQL. Also a choose your own adventure and teaches you a lot about mapping ethics.

GEOG 328: teaches you how to create web based visualizations using javascript/html/css and Mapbox. Great technical add and covers a lot of material. Projects are great for a portfolio.

GEOG 465: introductory SQL class teaching you how to map using a PostgreSQL backend. Highly important for full-stack coding, a little tedious at times.

GEOG 450: a Python course focused on creating Seattle based visualizations that have nothing to do with maps. Teaches python scripting, web crawling, d3.js and more. Not the most necessary class but certainly helpful.

Favorite profs: 

Gunwha Oh: the dawg, super sweet Korean lady that cares about her job, her students, and maps!

Bo Zhao: the beast, this guy makes maps like a mofo. Best laid-out classes in the major. All on github.

&#x200B;

**Career Prospects:**

* Level One: ArcGIS monkey, using ESRI products to build out data viz. This is the most simplistic, most common way to perform GIS and the lowest paying.
* Level Two: GIS Web Dev, create geospatial applications using full stack.
* Level Three: Geospatial Data Scientist, be a god of the domain. Basically, just a data scientist with a geospatial stack, creating data pipelines, viz, applications, and ml models. 

There are infinite ways to make money in geospatial. Just think, the more skilled you are the more you are likely to get paid.

Where Can I Work?:  
Any tier-one company, of course. Anything that has to do with maps. I noticed a lot of government jobs require highly specific geospatial web app skills. Even Pokemon Go hires Geography Data Scientists. Look up ESRI as well, this is one of the largest mapping companies.

classes I have heard about:

Urban GIS, GEOG 317 and a few others are all ESRI based classes using ArcGIS. Supposedly teach you some cool stuff with an industry staple software.
