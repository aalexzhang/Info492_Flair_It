I live in Hansee and I have since about winter quarter and my skin has not been this bad since I was a freshman in high school. It was fine when I lived in the new dorms, so it’s definitely not a change in habits. While my dorm seems pretty mold free the bathrooms seem to be covered in it, particularly the showers. 

These showers seem like they are never properly washed or maintained, there is a whole in the floor of one of them that has just become one large crevasse of black mold.

Is this just my wing/floor or does anyone else who lives in Hansee experience this? Is this an issue that can be fixed? Anyone else have any moldy Hansee experiences? ",Student Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1c78tmk/mold_in_hansee/,6,22,new

13,1c6wmvb,"The Bakery, thoughts?","My freshman year there were so many more houses that hosted shows and I used to really enjoy going to them. But, now it seems like the bakery is really the only one and SO MANY people go. I find it so stressful and can't help but worry something bad might happen.  

Also, I personally feel like the vibes of shows has changed. They use to all be about inclusivity and being yourself and I use to have a lot of fun at them and enjoyed talking to people, but I feel like the last couple times I've gone to the bakery I have felt very unwelcomed and like no one wants to talk to me. One clear thing I have noticed is people dress up way more for the shows, I feel like I can't just wear what I wore to class that day anymore. I have to put on some elaborate trend setting outfit with cool eyeliner just for people to not cut me i the bathroom line. I understand self expression, but its gotten to a point where it feels like I have to perform and present a certain way just to attend. Honestly it feels like I'm back in high school except in high school I was too queer for the cool kids and now I feel like I don't present queer enough, but now all the cool kids are bi in a het relationship and don't like the word lesbian because it ""sounds too harsh"".

I haven't attended one in a while though, is this still the vibe? Does it still get PACKED? and idk maybe because it 420 and there's no theme it might not be as intense.  My friends and I are thinking or going, but also seriously not because this is an experience we've all felt. have people had good experiences there as of lately? What type of people have been attending? Part of me also thinks maybe its because I am not a freshman anymore, I know non freshman go, but I also know ALOT of freshman do attend and maybe only want to talk to other freshman. Who knows, and maybe what I am saying is a hot take. ",Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1c6wmvb/the_bakery_thoughts/,11,25,new

56,1c4f23e,How does the major system work?,"Hello everyone!

I am an international student and was directly admitted to Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences this application cycle. I was wondering about how the major system worked since UW is one of my top choices at the moment. From my understanding, I would have to list a few engineering majors (3?) if I wanted to apply to the College of Engineering, right? Say, I put Chemical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Electrical Engineering as my top choices. If I was admitted to one of those and not the other two, would I automatically become my admitted major? Or do I get the choice to keep my original dtc major? Also, in case I get accepted to all three engineering majors (if that’s possible), do I get to choose?

So when I was done with CC, I looked and realized I could only apply to get a degree that had no prerequisites. Even English had a LONG list of prerequisite classes I had never taken. I'm pretty stupid for not preparing. I also don't intend to waste more money on taking those prerequisites at the cc, I am not in the financial position to do that and then wait another year for admission at UW. 

For a little context I will be a lawyer, and I just knew I would take a major that was focused in humanities and arts and then head out to law school. So I chose classics(as a transfer) and will start this year. 

So now I'm curious on what to expect for this major. I love history and reading so I'm not worried I won't like it, but I wonder, what type of people take these classes? it was clearly not my intended major and I don't know anyone that's taken a major like this, it's even more ""out there"" than Philosophy.

I applied for this admission cycle and was directly admitted to Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences. Given the relatively early deadline of UW, I was not completely sure of my major at the time although I was sure it was going to be either Chemistry or Chemical Engineering. So I applied as a Chemistry major without giving it much thought, but I decided I was going to pursue engineering a while after I applied to UW. Now that I am accepted and UW actually it’s one of my top choices, I realize that I should’ve applied as an engineering major if I wanted to pursue ChemE. Hence my questions are, can direct admits change their major after enrolling? If so, how difficult would be for me to change my major from Chemistry to ChemE? And how competitive is it to get directly admitted to Chemistry? I am an international student, if it’s a factor.

My goal is to go into quantitative finance (researcher/trader) or work at a startup. This means I will likely do a math double major/minor along with perhaps pursuing graduate school in CS or Math. The cost difference between UW compared to UIUC and UMich is about 20k/year after scholarships and other stuff is included (have not gotten finaid package back so could be less than 20k).

I like UW but the problem is ik alot of ppl from UW and they mostly go into SWE and FAANG/big company jobs (based on linkedin and talking to many UW ppl) which is not something I’m interested in. UIUC has more finance recruiters and proximity to Chicago for finance and UMich has Ross school of business (I could minor here) which attracts finance people. For UIUC I could also switch to CS + Math or + Physics since they offer those programs in undergrad + I like the school a lot too.

I am not quite sure about the startup scene throughout these schools since none of them are near bay area.

If I choose to go to UIUC or Umich I WILL NOT be taking loans or going into debt due to my grandparents. Please help me choose whether the UIUC/Umich is worth it especially for someone who wants to work in finance/startups.

I was wondering if doing them again over the summer at a CC before the fall quarter at UW is possible? It would be a great way to boost my GPA when trying to get admitted to CS.

If the summer quarter option isn't possible,  how would taking Calc 2 and Phys 1 in my first quarter at UW look in the admission process? I would take INFO 200 along with it to finish off the Informatics prerequisites.

If anyone has tried going either route can you let me know how it went? Would they look desperate/ knock me some points in the CS admission process?

133,1bzciqi,Idea: Be nice to the people you want to convince,"EDIT: I am making the exact same mistake, the title is ironically a lesson I should listen to. The original post was a cathartic angry release and it was more about me feeling better than addressing the audience (""HUB vandals"", etc). 

Especially w/Gaza war and killing, it's too much death to wrap your head around and I think that it is probably unleashing shock/defensiveness/cognitive dissonance worldwide. I got in my own way by just indulging in being pissed and I respectfully do believe vandals did as well.

It is much easier to cross the bridge and change your mind (political opinion, etc) when the other person is inviting you in with open arms. I have been in the situation of needing to change before and you can psychologically feel the difference between when ""agreeing"" is framed as ""defeat"" and when it's ""joining your friends to do the right thing"".

I know that it is possible to get ourselves out of the way (vandals, reactionaries, me yapping and malding etc) and keep keep keep telling the people we know about all the bombing and killing in Gaza. It should be impossible to ignore.

This is exactly why I was writing about ""being careful about how we do it"". I think that it's important to be measured in your activism because you can appeal to people's emotions, beliefs etc without inviting pride, defensiveness, ego etc to the door.

This is one of those massively important and sickening historical events, and as a consequence it is so easy to frame as something to get on board with rather than using shame or force. We are very lucky to not have to use force in our situation.

I believe you (vandals) are righteous motherfuckers... you make me think about how much I'm willing to be uncomfortable... AND I think the expression of that has impacts; you can certainly see them below.

ORIGINAL POST:

This is addressed to ""the HUB vandals"", to distinguish between those who were trying to show the world the horrible truth about Gaza, and those who were ideologically masturbating with Sharpies.

Israel's reputation thrives off being known as the ""orderly security force"", as opposed to the ""frothing radical Palestinian terrorists"". This is a lie. Regardless, western media, American politicians, and the public are looking closely for examples.

This is an unfair box to be put in. You cannot be complacent sign-holders, and at the same time, you cannot be window-breakers. Civil disobedience is the remedy, this is a PERFECT opportunity for a sit-in. The cause needs the attention.

You can really tell how much someone gives a shit by how much they're willing to decenter themselves. And it seems that some of you really hate your audience. Yelling at reporters, slinging slurs, etc. Openly harassing anyone who came to PUBLICIZE YOUR DEMONSTRATION. (The goal)

When directly offered media attention... by the THE STATE-SPONSORED UNIVERSITY NEWSPAPER... which was going to show up, and has the largest audience... you cut off your nose to spite your face, and decided the Daily was ""too liberal"". And now the people you yelled at have a statement out about how much you yelled at them.

The vandalism is the perfect example. You could have covered the HUB wall to wall in flyers, communicated just as well, and then you would have had plenty of photos of UW staff taking them down. The cause gets the attention for longer, the administration has less to slander you with. You GAIN ATTENTION and SYMPATHY (support. for the cause. remember the cause?) at the cost of IMMEDIATE CATHARTIC RELEASE.

These choices were clearly made to show that ""the movement"" would not be moderated or constrained by authority. These are choices of ideological purists, tribalist book-thumpers, self-interested folks.

Have you noticed how protestors in worse circumstances-- PALESTINIANS, FOR EXAMPLE-- seem to be chiefly interested in impact, effect, and visibility? There is no armed struggle to wage on Red Square, so surely you are responsible for crafting the most-heard protest, not the most-strong.

There is NO EITHER-OR CHOICE between ""caring about optics"" and ""denouncing civilian carpet-bombing"", actually, and Lenin's spirit is not judging you from the sky. 

How can you so desperately want power and refuse to level with your audience? 1960s revolutionaries knew how to strategize to defeat the Western media machine, you guys just seem to know how to get mad. To those stubborn leftists who are putting themselves before their cause, I hope you are ignored in the public square for as long as you can't figure out how to accept what you can't control. 

(If you are unfamiliar with the killing in Gaza, you ought not to be hated for it, and you are welcome under the umbrella of protecting innocent life. The Wikipedia page for the ""Israel–Hamas war"", while Westernized, is a much better picture of the situation than what American news media will promote)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bzciqi/idea_be_nice_to_the_people_you_want_to_convince/,7,40,new

The GPA recommendation for Seattle is a 3.75 minimum with extra-curriculars which is easy enough to be competitive, but I don’t want to be rejected and then have almost nothing transfer over to Tacoma so not sure if I should just play it safe with UWT or not.

Another conundrum is i was already accepted to UWT, but not UWS for CS. I feel like sticking with a community college would still be good to save money, but are there any opportunities for me financially to save money over at Tacoma my first two years instead?

155,1bygdgh,Dorming Dilemma for an Incoming Freshman,"Hey y'all, I'm an incoming freshman at UW and am really struggling to pick a housing option for the upcoming school year. I would like to stay on-campus due to easier access to classes and general convenience; HOWEVER, I am quite hesitant to be paired up with a random roommate(s) and would like a single room option, if possible.   


From my research so far, it seems like Hansee Hall is the only undergrad dorm with singles. This, though, comes with a communal bathroom, which I don't think I'll adjust well to. Apartments seem like the best option, so I've been looking into Cedar, Mercer Court, Nordheim, Radford, and Stevens. Getting a single at any of these as a freshman, however, seems very challenging. Are any of these apartments feasible for my situation? If not, should I just resort to commuting from home (it's only a 30-minute drive by car)? Please note that money/finances isn't an issue.

163,1bxunar,Petition to have a student referendum on the termination of students/groups responsible for the vandalism of the Husky Union Building (HUB),"Obviously, the vandalism inside the HUB is like poking the bear, but going after student artwork? Why are you dragging students who took the time to make those pieces of artwork and throwing them into the fire? You may outnumber the administration, but by triggering a chain reaction of friends of students who made those artworks, leading to more friends, you will be the one outnumbered in the end. 

Here's my reasoning for this referendum. I will address the elephant in the room: the group SUPER UW.

The student referendum. Unlike the elephant, it's the best chance we can end this without any violence. If the majority of current students want them responsible for the student referendum, the university administration will take action. I mean, who wouldn't do that under the banner of 'the majority of our students want us to take action against this vandalism'? 

Now, the group and its supporters may spin this student referendum as an abuse of power from the administration, but it's not really an abuse of power if they took action based on the statement that 'the majority of our students want us to take action against this vandalism.' Don't you love democracy? 

Another spin would be that the administration is silencing the minority of students in their university. This would be an amazing argument...if you didn't have your supporters vandalize literally anything in the HUB. 

We all know that they are the ones organizing these protests—the one that started from the Quad at 6 p.m. on Friday and stayed at the HUB overnight. Here is their official post from their Instagram. 

super\_uw: We’ve begun an overnight sit-in in the HUB. We are in firm solidarity with Palestinians facing genocide, demanding that UW materially and academically divest from Israel, cut all ties with Boeing, and end the anti-Palestinian repression of students, workers, and faculty.

Join us tonight at the HUB until International Quds Day. 

The vandalism happened when they did the sit-in inside the HUB overnight. The vandalism happened during the sit-in inside the HUB overnight. The vandalism inside the HUB is plastered with their motives. 

You don't have to be rocket scientists to combine two and two. 

The group, SUPER UW, should take responsibility for this matter, as they were in the closest proximity to the vandalism. Yet, they haven't. They believe that this was a peaceful protest, even though there were crimes against students and their artworks were subjected to vandalism, as none of the artworks were about the main issue. 

Another official statement: 

“Inside, dozens of students are preparing to take back our student union building as a place to express our collective power as people committed to Palestinian liberation and encampments free from Zionism,” a speaker from the United Front for Palestinian Liberation at UW said. “Several of these students are attaching themselves to a device called a lockbox which makes it almost impossible for them to be removed against their will.”  - TheDaily (University allows pro-Palestinian protesters to occupy HUB overnight)

Dozens of students? Did y'all vandalize dozens of students' artwork in the HUB? Ironic, isn't it? Except this time, everyone knows that the group and the individuals responsible for the vandalism will drag unrelated students into their own self-proclaimed goal. They proved that you would be collateral damage to their cause, whether you liked it or not. 

They did that with students' artwork inside the HUB, **UNRELATED TO THE PROTEST**. 

Who's next?

If they can get away with this without any repercussions, I bet they will do it again. 

And the next one will be even more crazier. Don't be surprised by their next one.

193,1bwq4vs,Uncomfortable spending at the District Market ,"so I’m a first year student living on west campus and I’ve been having real problems spending all of my dining money per quarter.

I use a cane as a mobility aid and have to get a basket if I pick up more than like 2 items—I constantly have people walk into me or avoid me because of my cane and the fact that I can’t walk normally like everyone else. it’s difficult for me to get the motivation/energy around my chronic pain and classes to go in the first place and I’m constantly really nervous and uncomfortable there.

Not only that but when I go, I go for my weekly groceries because it’s difficult to go every day—and the employees constantly comment on how much I am buying? But I have to, otherwise they won’t give me a bag and I have to struggle to get my groceries back to my dorm. One time, I brought my own bag and they rushed me to get out of there— so much so that while I was trying to put my groceries in my bag (one handed—again, it’s difficult to do things standing with my cane in the other hand supporting me), I dropped a thing of blueberries and had to pick them up by myself, crying and in pain, while another student shoved around me to check out where MY GROCERIES WERE STILL SITTING.

The north campus Dm is even worse, because they DO NOT even have baskets at all. Imagine if I was living there and just needed to get more than the two items I can carry in one arm!

Rant about how the DM treats students aside, I would love some advice on how to spend my dining money more effectively while combating my disabilities (mental and physical), pain, and social anxiety.

**School: UCSB Vs UW**

US News Rank: 35 Vs 40

Acceptance Rate: 29% Vs 46%

Total Cost Per Year: 40k Vs 60k (oos)

Location: Beach Town Vs Big City

Student-Faculty Ratio: 17:1 Vs 21:1

Overall, UCSB appears better in every meaningful statistic, however, the specific program is what I am more curious about. In 2023, UW Foster's starting salary for undergrads was 76.6k in 2023 with a 94% placement after 3 months, and the average signing bonus was 8.5k. This makes it significantly better than UW overall.

On the other hand, UCSB Pre-Economics & Accounting major has very little data available online and feels like a bit more of a gamble. Does anyone have any data on UCSB accounting major? I am leaning towards Foster since their MBA is ranked 20th on US news (which is still relevant to the undergraduate program) and since I have concrete data on outcomes. Some data on UCSB's accounting/econ program and any possible first-hand experience would be super helpful before making a decision.

Extra: I have also been waitlisted by Michigan and UCSD and was wondering how they would stack up in case I am offered a spot.

I spoke to a couple of sophomores recently and they told me about the intense weed-out classes for STEM majors. with harsh grading curves (2.6 or 2.9 for some intro classes....crazy right?).

Does the same also apply to people majoring in Business/Econ/Psychology/Poli Sci?

255,1bt5vll,Help a business girlie choose💼 : kelley (IU) vs Foster (UW Seattle),"I'm a direct admit at Kelley and Foster not looking to major in finance. I'm interested in Entrepreneurship and want to be involved in/launch my own startups. 

Kelley pros-


1. Great placements + internship opportunities (placements records are public in a detailed manner, I like the transparency)

2. Prestige (t10 undergrad bschool)


Kelley cons-


1. Bloomington is really pretty but I'm afraid I'm a city girl

2. I wasn't impressed with the startup culture there (I went through their Accelerator website, pitching competition winners, company websites etc etc)

3. I've never lived in a snowy climate but I don't think I'll like it 


Udub pros-

1. LOVE the entrepreneurial culture in udub (very abundant) and in Seattle

2. Seattle ☀️🌊🤩


Udub cons


1. Health and biology heavy startups (A LOT of startups in udub are related to the medical field culminating in a strong medical startup community. I might have a hard time earning funding? )

2. Seattle 🔪🔫😨 (I live in a crime heavy city so ik the works but as an intl student, my parents would be stressed about me choosing seattle over a safe place like bloomington)

3. The placements records are very unspecific and I'm unsure whether foster could get me the internships which Kelley can. Avg salary of graduates is basically the same for both but foster graduates work in wa, ca, etc whereas Kelley graduates work in IL, IN, etx so the col varies by a lot.

4. Seattle has very short days during the winters

305,1bqtc52,UW Seattle vs Purdue,"Hey everyone, was accepted into UW for Fall 2024. I received the Pre Major in the College of Arts and Sciences instead of Business at Foster. I understand how difficult it is to get into Foster DA but just wanted to know the difficulty to get in Standard Admission and what is generally required for this. 

At the same time at Purdue I am admitted into the Business Analytics Major Upper Division which intrigues me. Initially I always wanted to go to UW but now I’m in two minds. 

As an international student I am more interested in the college experience and academics I’ll receive from both universities. 

Which one would be better for business and university experience wise? 

Any opinions and advice as to how to get in through Standard admission, the difficulties alongside Standard Admission and what option would suit my current situation will be greatly appreciated as I’m hoping to make a decision between the two regardless of the cost of the universities.

I intend to study biology and go into research or environment conservation. I'm not considering pre-med though since I don't want to be a doctor/physician/nurse/stuff like that; I'm more of a ""studying plants and animals and ecosystems"" guy.

My question is: is UDub hard for a biology major, and are there many opportunities for ***non***\-pre-med people? preferably research-related? If current pre-sciences or biology majors can share their experiences I'd be super grateful.

My strategy was to order each place's black milk tea with tapioca as a default baseline. This doesn't cover other types of tea like green tea, fruit tea, or any unique flavors that might make a place stand out, so if any of you have specific recommendations for these please let me know! I may expand/adjust my spreadsheet over time as I try more from these places, hence why I'm sending a link instead of a screenshot.

Tastes will be subjective and you may not agree with my reviews, and I am not claiming to be a boba expert by any means.

In-person event:

Teams of up to 6 people travel on foot to various locations on WWU campus in Bellingham WA, solving a total of four hour-long puzzles gathering clues along the way to solve one final meta puzzle. It takes place on Saturday, April 9 at 9:30 am in Red Square.

Online Synchronous event:

Again, teams of up to six collaborate on four hour-long puzzles and one meta puzzle. The online event features the same puzzles as the in-person event and begins at the same time. It takes place on the Great Puzzle Hunt website (see link below).

These are no ordinary puzzles though! It will take a diverse set of skills and talents to solve them! Our mission is to celebrate everyone's talents and demonstrate knowledge comes in many forms. So yes, you can win :)

I know that a certificate alone is never enough to enter this field, as it’s all about the portfolio and skills, but I’m looking to see if this is a good starting point to learn the fundamentals in a structured environment. 

Also, can anyone verify that this isn’t run by those for-profit bootcamps that just cash in on the university’s name? I know this is a common practice with university certificates but I can’t find evidence of this for this certificate, which hopefully means it’s run by UW itself.

I was hoping to get an opinion. I was part of a frat and during mid-quarter, I had to drop out due to complicated medical issues that were carrying on before I even dropped my fraternity.

However, even though I dropped they are still trying to get me to pay dues even though they never took me off of the chapter roster after I declared my drop to my president.

Is there any way I can get out of this? I don't think it's reasonable for me to pay a quarter's worth of dues if I never even benefited from being a part of the frat due to my health concerns. And even after I dropped, they never took me off the roster which seems a little sketchy to me.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR For Previous Posts:** Applied to Foster twice with a low GPA and didn't get in. A lot more goes in to it, but that's the gist of it. My goal is now to get into grad school (Not Foster).

**TL;DR For This Post:** Did two internships, rejected both return offers. Going all in, full speed on my pipe dreams. Husky 100 info at the end. 

Since absolutely no one asked for this, I thought I'd give an update on what I've been upto for all zero people who were waiting for this!

I told myself I wouldn't make an update before something significant happens, and in reality, the saga would be a lot more interesting if I made this post later this fall but when I looked at the last post I made and saw it was 21 months ago I thought maybe I'll post an update now so it doesn't become an even longer post later.

To say I was devastated after what took place in my last post is an understatement. My morale was down in the toilet the entire summer after everything happened, and to be honest, it still pisses me off every time I think about the entire situation, and it pains me even more because, at the end of the day, I put myself in that situation in the first place and I got no one else to blame for it.

I said in my last post I was going to study for the GMAT, but Mental health was nonexistent at the time, and I just couldn't do it so I put it on the back burner (more on that later).

When Fall quarter came around, I was trying to cope with being back at square zero and decided to get my mind off it as much as I could by getting more involved on campus (I think I've doxed myself enough, so I'm leaving it at that)

I don't know what took over me, having had zero hope for internships after what happened to the last one, but I decided to send out two applications for summer 2023 internships, with one of them being a long shot and the other one being a little more of a reasonable reach for me.

I ended up getting a first-round interview a week after my application. A week later, I was invited for a final round interview, and a day later, I got an offer! I accepted it, I think, a week or two later, but honestly, I didn't count on it much after what happened last time, and I had my expectations at zero this time before I was behind my desk, which was nine months away.

This is a story for a different day, but although by all measures, this internship would be a dream for many people with amazing benefits and pay right out of school, it's not what I want to do ultimately, so I wasn't going to call it done here.

That was my fall 2022 quarter. Nothing really happened in Winter and Spring 2023 except two somewhat small things, which I won't mention, although they are kind of relevant to what I want to do later, because if I haven't doxed myself yet, I'll definitely do it by mentioning them! I'll say this, though: They look good on a resume for some brownie points, that's all.

When the Summer quarter came around, I started my internship, and it was a great experience. I didn't accept a full-time offer, though. I still want to do a master's, and as I said earlier, it's not my top choice for a career.

Right after my internship ended, I sent out a handful of applications for Winter 2024 internships at other firms. Within one week, I was invited for an interview for a similar internship at a much larger firm for which I got an offer 4h after my interview. I'm going to leave this one at that, and I'm intentionally being vague because UW Bothell has 5k students on a good day, and I'm definitely doxing myself at this point if I say anything else.

By every measure and metric in the universe, this internship would be a dream for anyone looking to make a career in the said field, but as I mentioned before, that field isn't the end goal for me, so this is not where I'm calling my journey done either, and I did not accept my return offer. Honestly, in this job market, this was a hard choice and a super risky move that may come back to bite me later, but we will see. (yes, I am stressing!)

&#x200B;

**Other Updates:**

* Back to the GMAT studying, masters is still very much something I'm thinking about and again I have to be vague here but the plan is to study for it sometime between now and end of the year as I'm planning to apply in 2024-2025 application cycle.
* My GPA is now above 3.0 from the less than 2.5 that it once was. I have straight 4.0s, but as you can imagine, moving the needle on the number of credits I have is not easy.
* I got into a summer program for 2024 (Being vague to not dox myself) which I would like to believe it was at least somewhat competitive with the average GPA being a 3.7 last year but who knows.
* I got a small scholarship which was kind of fun! It felt good to be recognized for something after all of this. But I also got rejected for two much larger schoolarships which really stung.

**Onto What You Are All Here For:** It comes with great displeasure to inform you all I have not been selected for the Husky 100. 

* Am I sadge? Yes. 
* Do I want to talk about it? No.
* Did I spend 6 hours a day for 3 weeks reliving the worst years of my life crying a river and writing my essay while doing my internship in January? Yes. 
* Will I apply again next year? No. Can't get sadge a second time if you don't try again in the first place.
* Do I feel like all this effort was for nothing? Absolutely!

That's all for now. Season Finale dropping Fall 2024! Either I get into a Master's program or into my local McDonalds as a janitor. Whatever happens, that will be the last update on this. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bksjmo/21_month_update_25_gpa_foster_reject_applies_to/,12,12,new

For context, I'm an international student who got accepted into UW College of Arts and Sciences for the year 2024. However, I would be deferring admission as I am serving in the army and will be joining in 2025.  

Upon researching on the UW website the undergrad tuition for nonresident is 40k while the total cost of attendance is about 64k. I'm guessing this implies the majority of the remaining 20k is housing. So I've been looking for ways to make it more affordable for me by trying alternative options for residency other than living in the college dorms. 

So my question is basically how are some of the ways I can reduce cost, Maybe by renting my apartment and sharing or something? Also, what are the rates and renting scenes like around the college? I would preferably like a spot closer to campus as I don't have a car and don't see myself traveling super far to get tot college. 

Any help would be appreciated. Feel free to Dm me too.

419,1bkp5gk,Why the fascination with Ivys over CS at UDub,"Unless  the CS rankings on USNews and other sites are totally messed up, the way I look at it is that besides MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU and UIUC, every other college is ranked lower for CS. And looking beyond the rankings, I see so many other tangible advantages that aren’t taken into account in the rankings - like UDub’s proximity to all the amazing companies in Seattle - Amazon, Meta, Google, the endowments from Pauly boy and BillyG, the guest lectures by Distinguished Scientists from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others, the wealth of nearby companies to intern at who don’t have to pay for your accommodation in this tight market, the startup scene, and the constantly rising bar of incoming CS Freshman, mostly gene-gifted kids of the sea of software engineer parents in the Puget Sound and beyond. I think UDub CS has an amazing future.

Yet I see this intense fascination with the lesser ranked Ivies and non-Ivies. Are these folks mere brand name chasers who want bragging rights, and/or have been conditioned to think that way by their helicopter parents, or am I missing something else. Do they not know about the CS ranking? Have they just given up on UDUb as out of staters, given its heavy preference for instaters? I could see the argument that this high up in the rankings, the specific order doesn’t matter as much, and all else being equal maybe a brand could open some doors.

Do you love books? Do you love flexing your book knowledge on others?

Rain City Book Bowl is a joint collaboration between Head in the Clouds Trivia and Quizbowl at the University of Washington. Our goal is to connect book nerds in Seattle by giving them a fun competitive outlet! This league will recur monthly in bookstores around the Seattle area.

Our trial run will be held at the HUB on UW campus. You can expect the event to be a hybrid of Head in the Clouds bar trivia and quizbowl. If you're unfamiliar with either or both of these question styles, no worries! We'll be explaining everything during the event, and I can answer questions in the comments of this post :)

Team size is capped at 4. No teammates? No problem! When you buy your tickets, you can also request to be placed on a team with other players. We hope that this will be a fun way to meet other Seattle readers!

We will be testing your knowledge of both old and new books, so our event will have an equal amount of questions about each. The genres covered will vary, but you can expect to be asked about classic books, sci-fi / fantasy, romance, poetry, and biography / nonfiction.

For more information, follow us on Instagram: raincitybookbowl. We hope to see you there!

Hi everyone! 
I'm coming to Seattle this summer to intern at Amazon. They recommend renting dorms at unis in Seattle (incl UW), so I thought I could ask some questions here:
1. Dorms are ~70/day depending on the college. Is it possible to find a sublease cheaper (I don't really care about the place as long as it's not infested)
2. Which college is most near the Amazon office? What about best location to explore Seattle? 
3. Is it worth bringing a car? Or is Seattle walkable like European cities? I wanna explore the town (and nature, I heard it's very beautiful), but perhaps the car is so much not worth it that I should rather rent whenever I go somewhere?
4. If someone in the same situation stumbled upon this post, pm me and let's meet! ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bkg640/housing_questions/,6,5,new

427,1bk8q4s,UW Honors or Cal Poly (political science),"So I was accepted into both, but I'm really struggling with the choice. I was accepted into others too, but I'm planning on going to law school after my degree so I didn't think it made too much sense to spend all of my or my parent's money on undergrad. 

Finances:

I'm a Washington resident and live literally 15 minutes away from the UW so that's a plus. The in-state tuition is about 8k-12k last time I checked, with housing and other shit obviously bringing it up a bit. Cal Poly is about 28k out of state.

Location:

I live in Seattle and I pass the UW all the time. It's a beautiful school but I guess I don't get that ""new"" feeling. But don't get me wrong, it's a great location. The Burke Gilman bike trail is literally right next to it, and I can see my family often. Cal Poly is better weather though. I don't actually like the Cal Poly campus itself, but the surrounding greenery and mountains are fucking incredible. And my cousin goes there so...

Academics:

So in terms of academics, I think the UW is probably going to be better for pols sci, especially because I got into the honors college, but I don't really know. I mean...Cal Poly literally had ""polytechnic"" in the name and that's not really my jam

Running Start:

I'm a running start student meaning by the time I graduate high school I will have my AA degree and 90 college credits. The UW is 100% going to accept all of them. I don't know about Cal Poly, I haven't called yet.

The College ""Experience""

So I've heard from some people the UW has a great social life but then some say it's crap. Iv'e heard the same about Cal Poly. I think both communities will have people who love exploring the outdoors like me because Seattle is generally super outdoorsy. So is Cal Poly though. 

&#x200B;

Iv'e always wanted to live in california but heres how I see it: theres no reason for me to spend around 50k more on Cal Poly, I got into UW honors, UW is pretty too in a different way, and I can always go to California for law school, my gap year after I get my degree, or I can study abroad for a quarter or two.

The only concern I have for the UW is if they'll let me declare my major. Iv'e heard that it takes two years to declare, but since I already have 90 credits, will they just let me declare immediately? Or maybe they'll never let me??

Thanks!

Also, I will be starting UW as a Junior after I transfer my credits over. A few things:

Is it realistic for me to secure a spot in the next offered Math334 course?

Does me being fresh out of highschool affect my performance in a good or bad way for the course? (I.e. would it be harder to transition into UW/general universify if I were to take the course, do you guys reccomend the sequence for basically a Freshman with college credits)

(For math majors): Is the course beneficial for a math major, or is it better for Physics students interested in advanced math concepts? It seems like the topics go by fast, so would it be more beneficial for me to take the math major requirements separately rather than taking them through this class? (I understand that generally speaking, it depends on the person, but for those who have taken Math 334 vs those who took Intro to proofs, intro to analysis, esc, which would provide a more in-depth understanding?)

But I also feel like it's the professor's responsibility to communicate expectations clearly and grade fairly.

With that out of the way, here is the situation: I took AMATH 482/582 with Prof. Shlizerman this past quarter, and did pretty good for the most part. However, on the last assignment I got a 12/20, which was a pretty big shock to me as I thought I had done everything required. A look at the rubric (which was not available before the homework was submitted, iirc) tells me that they graded me down for omitting things that were not specified as required (or even mentioned) on the actual homework. Additionally, I was given 0 points for several things that I did actually do. There was no feedback on why I missed these points. From the class discord, I know at least a few other people were graded much more harshly than they were expecting. I sent a canvas message to the professor and the two TAs (one of whom graded my assignment) last night and have not gotten a response. From what other students have told me, the professor has been pretty bad about responding to emails this quarter, and I'm worried I'm not even going to get a response. 

I don't know if getting these points back would change my final grade (he didn't give us a grade scale), and honestly I'm not too upset with my current grade anyway. At this point I honestly just want someone to listen to my concerns and clarify what I did wrong.

462,1biqzti,Rate my path (ECE Community Transfer),"Hey guys, I'm a senior in highschool. After a stone cold rejection letter, I started researching alternative pathways for me to take, and where UW might fit into a hypothetical pathway. An appeal a day keeps the regrets away, but I must take a realistic adult stance.

I always knew the community college transfer route is a great path, but further research made it seem like it's in fact an amazing path. [Data from UW](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/transfer/ctc-admissions-data) seems to show that almost 70% of transfer applicants are accepted into UW. Among that 70%, it seems that 89% who apply into Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) are accepted? (if I'm interpreting the stats correctly)

If this is true, I feel that this should be a great path to take. After making sure that my community college has the pre-req courses necessary for the ECE major, **do you guys think community college is the way to go? Any advice or people who have gone down a similar path?**

The main thing keeping me from attending another 4-year is cost savings. Not just living from home, but my lenient chill job pays me $24/hour, so staying home while keeping that job could have great financial outcomes. Plus, it seems that as long as I maintain good performance in terms of GPA and activities, I may have an excellent chance at ECE.

Also side question: does UW prioritize certain community colleges over other colleges? The college within my bounds is Olympic College in Bremerton, WA.

465,1biejlz,Do high CSE 142/143 grades make up for lower Calculus grades for the comp sci school?,"A little background info:

I'm applying as a transfer student after returning to school to finish my comp sci prerequisites. I was self-taught prior to this, so I tested out of CSE 141, got a 3.9 in CSE 142, and expect to get a 3.9 this quarter for CSE 143. My Precalculus was 4.0 and I expect to get a 3.3 for Calc I this quarter. My overall GPA is around 3.6 and I'm shooting for 3.82 GPA for Fall-Spring '24.

Can anyone say whether the Paul G Allen School favors higher CSE grades, or would my CSE and MATH grades have equal weight?

Another bit of valuable info: Due to a mixup by Shoreline, I wasn't able to start Calc I until Winter quarter, meaning I'll still be lacking the Calc III necessary for Paul G Allen School. However, my credits will satisfy UWT's CS program by the end of Spring '24, so I may have to attend UWT instead. I also had a rough high school experience and dropped out with a 1.6 GPA at 16. I can see them interpreting that either positively or negatively. 

I realize my time would most likely be better spent asking an advisor, but in my experience they tend to give vague answers so I'm hoping to get some good first hand advice. Thanks all!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1biejlz/do_high_cse_142143_grades_make_up_for_lower/,2,2,new

I'm a junior entering my spring quarter, and I'm currently in MCD and hoping to go to medical school. My current gpa is about a 3.71. I transferred here this autumn from UWB and got into my major this Winter quarter. 

My problem is that I've found that I simply don't enjoy MCD the way I thought that I would, and I have been taking health humanities courses (health ethics, health disparities) and have found that I genuinely love them, and I get really excited about taking similar courses. For this reason, I want to switch to global health. I feel like investing in something I'm passionate about and genuinely enjoy will make my undergrad far less misery inducing. 

My problem is that I have changed my mind really, really late. But I've also taken enough humanities courses that fit into the global health (BS) major that I'm actually technically further along the gh track than I am for MCD. I'm completely willing to take a fifth year of classes and to graduate late just to be in this major. I really think that I can be successful studying global health (I've gotten a 3.9-4.0 in every related course). 

I have strong healthcare experience (have volunteered at the ER for six months and have volunteered at health clinics aimed at underserved populations since the age of 14). I know that I can do a minor in global health, but I'd really like to major in it and I want to know if I actually have a chance and if its worth trying to switch over. 

Is it in any way possible that they would admit me? I understand that certain programs have some sort of a timeline in place and that they're less likely to accept you sometimes.

Not to trauma dump, but for a fuller a picture, in my junior year my dad died which messed up my grades quite a bit. I am a running start student and from what I remember I got one N/C, one D, and one C-. The rest were A's and B's. GPA dropped from 4.0 to I believe a 3.6. 

With those grades I still somehow managed to get accepted for Marine Bio for the 2024 Autumn quarter. 

With that this year has been equally a struggle (due to some extra family issues that were caused from my dads passing) I got two C's fall quarter and I believe I will either be getting a D or an N/C (depending on which I decide to take) and a B for winter quarter. My GPA, without winter quarters grades, is currently a 3.4. 

I have reason to believe that the rest of this year I will get A's and B's as all I'm really taking next quarter are PE classes because that's I still need for grad credits. 

I've talked to my therapist and she says she'll write a letter explaining my current situation which we have reason to believe will improve considerably after I move to college. 

I am fully aware that I messed up big and this is fully on me, no excuses. I know that I will probably get a letter asking what happened. What I really want to know is what has it taken for people to get rescinded in the past and how screwed am I really? I know there will be no guarantees but I just want some form of confirmation on my chances.

However, when I took Accounting this past winter quarter, I realized that Business is not something I wanted to pursue, and I don't want to take them.

Also I had to drop out of accounting this winter (GPA dd not get affected but did show as a W in the transcript) due to family concerns.

In terms of OOS affordability, wtf is the deal? I got $4200 from the Purple and Gold scholarship, so that covers a tiny bit (tysm so so generous 😭) but what am I looking at for total cost? I would look into this on my own but i’m honestly so confused on varying sticker prices. I have around 60k (probably a little less) in college savings, but I know that’s not going to cover all four years, maybe not even one. Does the university give any more money based on the FAFSA? Or am I totally screwed? My FAFSA is already messed up because the 2022 information is before my father quit his job and went off the deep-end leaving me in a single income divorced family situation so idk the expected contribution. I think my mom makes around 100k a year but she really only got our house and the cars in the divorce so there’s not a ton of equity there. 

With the financial context set, assuming UW is even an option, how does applying to majors work? This quirky system scares me because I am wholly unsure of my future career and major. I like political science but would probably go to law school after because there’s not a lot of jobs there (especially that pay well). I also like biology and anthropology but don’t want to be in academia. I’m hoping that I’ll find a career that pairs my interests in a way that also pays off my debt lmfao. With my uncertainty in mind, wtf do I do my freshman year. It seems like you have to be proactive about taking prereqs for the majors and that they’re competitive and I feel like it’ll be hard to compete when I literally don’t know where I’ll be competing.

This is a more general question about college trade-offs, but is it really worth it to go somewhere that feels boring and unfulfilling if it’s the cheapest option? I got into UMN with honors (I’d have little to no debt there), but it’s only 5 hours from home and I need to get out of the midwest lol. I also found out my ex is going there and I honestly feel like my growth would be stunted if I’m surrounded in the same environment that I’m trying to escape right now. That sounds a little dramatic but the past two years of my life have been hell and this girl embodies all of that suffering lol. Also, this is 100% an ego thing, but I’ve worked so hard and academics have been the foundation of my self worth my whole life and I’m going to be dissapointed if I end up at a college half of my HS class goes to.

What it's about: all of the dirty laundry that gets aired by genetic tests like 23andme and AncestryDNA. We'll talk about how it's a paternity test not just for you but all your relatives, finding relatives, finding relatives of serial killers to solve cold cases,  ancestry analysis at many levels and surprises, including about how race and ethnicity are not the same thing, about dodgy marketing of products and eating disorders, about intersex surprises, about health interpretations that people stumble into, and about reproductive implications, with detours for ranting about ablism and homophobia and transphobia and racism and cultural appropriation with the ability to get credit for it.

* anyone who has wanted to do a direct-to-consumer genetic test or has done one or has relatives who have done one
* premeds who are going to be seeing patients wielding their test results
* anyone who wants a 5 credit course that meets Natural World Credit and Social Science distribution requirements in a fun and approachable way
* anyone who wants to get a fairly easy, fun good grade in their spring quarter *without any exams ,* with flexibility about lecture attendance vs asynchronous viewing, and with assignments that are largely done in discussion section
* people who want a strong letter of recommendation from a teaching team that will get a chance to know you and plausibly assess your quantitative and scientific reasoning skills and your leadership and group work and cultural competence and ethics, i.e. all the stuff that grad schools and employers like to hear about

\- if the latter, then what majors do i pick for the best chances of transfer to cs? can i pick acms from pre-sciences? the website says that acms is capacity constrained - does this mean that if they've also  admitted people dtm already, it's gonna be insanely hard to get in?? i wouldn't want to be stuck with microbiology since that's the only science major that's not capacity constrained. alternatively, can i pick a major from the college of engineering or the college of information when i got into pre-sciences.  
\- and finally, if i don't even get accepted to cs in transfer, can i transfer to electrical and computer engineering or computer science and engineering? how easy is it to transfer to either of these majors instead?

583,1bf5d5j,PSA for Admitted First Years about Majors,"Congratulations all incoming huskies! 

Every year there is some confusion about majors and applying to UW, and I’m seeing some of that here, so I hope this can clear some things up.

When you applied for UW and selected your intended major, if you are admitted that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re actually in the major. Only a select number of majors have the potential for incoming first years to be directly admitted, and those are listed at the attached link. MOST majors at UW do not allow for direct admit, so if you selected any of those majors on your application as your intended major and were admitted, you were admitted to UW as major undeclared, and may be noted as “pre-major”, “pre-sciences”, “pre-health”, or “pre-art” in your portal, all of these mean you don’t have a major.

Psychology for example does not have direct admit, so if you selected psychology and were admitted, you are not actually IN the psychology major. You would need to look up psychology’s pre-requisites, complete those courses, and apply once you’re here. Some majors are selective and competitive to get into, some only have minimum requirements that as long as you complete those you’re admitted, and some majors are open, meaning there are no pre-reqs and you can declare at any time.

Please just be aware during your planning for your first year that there are some steps you may need to take in order to actually get into your major, and plan to take those pre-reqs as soon as possible. UW is different than other schools that will typically admit you into your major when you’re admitted to the school, but UW more often than not will admit only to the school and not directly to any major. 

I hope this clears some things up!

592,1bf1blq,Spacious room for rent in Ravenna neighborhood [AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY],"Hi guys! I am moving home after this quarter and am looking for someone to take over my room because my house's lease goes through August.

The house is located in the Ravenna neighborhood, about a 20 minute walk from campus. It is right next to a stop on the 67 bus line and about a 5 minute walk from the Roosevelt Link station. You would have 6 other roommates in the house, who are all males. Most of them are athletes at UW, so you end up having the house to yourself a fair bit. The house is spacious and has a large kitchen upstairs as well as a nice living room with couches and a TV to hangout in.

As for specifics to the room, it is generously sized and already partially furnished. There is a queen size bed/mattress, a dresser, a desk, and a large garment rack that I would be willing to pass along. The room is downstairs in the house, and right next to a separate kitchen area with an oven, stove, fridge, and sink that myself and one other roommate have to ourselves. The room is also across the hall from a full bathroom that is also shared between myself and one other roommate.

As put in the title, the room is also available immediately. March rent is already paid for, so if you wanted to move in next week you would end up getting half a month or so for free. Rent comes out to about $1000 per month, including utilities. There is actually another room in the house that's going to be available soon as well, so if anyone wanted to move in with a friend we would probably be able to make that work.

If anyone is interested, please message me for more info!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1bf1blq/spacious_room_for_rent_in_ravenna_neighborhood/,2,8,new

I took challenging AP classes in my 11th and 12th grade year, including ENGL 101 COMP (college cred class) where I earned a B+. I go to the #1 feeder school for UW in WA state.

Extra curriculars: 4 years of Varsity basketball & track, where I was captain for both sports during 2 of the years. AAU circuit basketball for 4 years. Music Studio Internship. I worked at a construction company. I worked at a restaurant. I volunteered. And I did a foreign exchange program in Costa Rica.

I am very confident in my personal statement because of the high grade I earned on my personal statement assignment from my ENGL 101 teacher who is notorious for being a very harsh grader. I got one of the best scores in my school.

I explained in the additional essay that the reason why my GPA is so low, is because I failed 4 classes in the second semester of 10th grade. This was due to my father passing away, and my brother being sent to a psychiatric ward for schizophrenia due to him being very violent.

On top of this, when I came back to school in 11th grade, I earned straight A’s in all of my classes. And prior to second semester of 10th grade, I was a A/ High B student.

641,1bboq41,STEM gpa at the U,"I recently started taking more STEM classes at my community college after planning to change my major to Neuroscience. I have managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA through my classes before this major change. However with the recent change in course rigor, I'm sitting around a 3.5 in the intro to Chem class I'm currently in. Is 3.5 a competitive GPA for STEM classes at UW? And would a 4.0 in Precalculus this quarter be enough to counter this and make me a competitive applicant academically?

Thanks in advance for any insights.

I mean, I have been here for 3 years and I had to look up her name. I have zero awareness of any contribution she has made but would like to know if she has.

Also, grad and post-grad students recently protesting for wage increases while the president collects a million dollars seems far too polarizing for a university that strives to be progressive and fair. The grads and post grads make up a huge chunk of the workforce and the success, or lack thereof, of the workforce, should be factored into the presidents salary.

693,1b865ed,Taking a quarter off as an international student,"Could any one of you guys tell me if I can take a quarter off after having been enrolled in the previous quarter? I have taken courses from Fall, Winter quarter but want to take time off in the Spring quarter because I am enrolled here at Queen's. I hope to start at UW from Summer quarter if possible. Is this allowed for an international student? Thank you guys so much!

But I wanted to enroll at Udub so much that I instead took several online courses for the Fall and Winter quarter. It has been some of the best courses I have ever taken even if they were online. I really enjoyed the format and the quality of the courses.

Luckily for me, I applied to both American and Canadian institutions at that time. I was also accepted by Queen's University in Canada. And during the time when I took the online courses from UW, I successfully received my Canadian student visa, which is kind of a relief for me.

But for me Queen's University is good but it is not like Udub which has a superiority in STEM and CS over almost all universities you can imagine(excluding some top schools, like Stanford, and Berkeley). I still hope to go there. And that is why I kept taking online courses from UW while I was registered at another University. I still have the opportunity to transfer here without filling out a returning student form or reapply.

Could any one of you guys tell me if I can take a quarter off after having been enrolled in the previous quarter?

So my attended major is computer science and i’ve gotten a start on my prereqs but i think i screwed myself over. for what ever reason i wanted to take my programming classes at seattle (via cross campus enrollment) and man did i get greeted by horrors. I want to get into the cs major in tacoma but it turns out the programming classes i took in seattle (cse 121 and cse 122) might not even satisfy the prereqs back in tacoma (tcss 142 and tcss 143). For the tcss 143 course the prereqs is the complimentary course below it (tcss 142) or cse 142 in the seattle campus, and as we all know that’s not available anymore. As for the prereqs for tcss 142 I still need to pass calc 1 which i unfortunately failed last quarter. The plan i thought up with might be either asking my counselor if me taking cse 122 might satisfy the tcss 143 prereq or just getting calc 1 over with this spring followed by taking tcss 142 + calc 2 in the summer and tcss 143 in the fall.

Still early days but worth a shot to see if anything is available!

I'm a 20M medical student from the United Kingdom and Canada who is doing a summer stint for research at UW Roosevelt at University District. Timeline isn't 100% but I plan on coming around Mid-May to the end of August. 

Would consider myself more reserved, but would massively prefer to live with others as I've heard it's pretty lonely if you don't know anyone, lol (and 21+ alcohol is a toughie), and I do like to go out from time to time. However, I plan on spending most my time in the lab or studying, so there's no issue if you want a quieter flatmate. I don't have any preference with gender, age etc and am fine living with undergrads or professionals/graduates. 

Budget is $1200 or under, but am flexible. Preferably a <15 minute walk away from Roosevelt Hospital/Main Campus.

Secondly, how long does UW take to evaluate transfer credits?  The other schools I'm applying to require a decision by June 1, is the evaluation likely to be done by then?  The amount of classes granted could make a big decision on whether or not I go to UW.

I’m left handed, and whenever there are exams in lecture halls without assigned seats, I am reminded that many people do not process that left side aisle seats have left handed desks. People seem to favor aisle seats so if I don’t get there right away, all the leftie desks are filled. During lectures, most people use laptops for notes so it’s not an issue, but with exams it’s ever so slightly annoying. My options are to either have an unnecessarily awkward writing position for the exam, or to have to ask someone “are you left handed?” and ask them to move when they say no fwhich in my experience, they always do). I wouldn’t be as bothered if the two outcomes weren’t always a) the person seeming awkward and embarrassed or b) the person looking at me like I just spoke an alien language.

I'm pursuing applied mathematics and am on my second year of CC, hoping to transfer to UW for winter 2025. I switched my major halfway through, and there will be like 2 prerequisites that I won't be able to finish in time by the application. 

That being said, I would still like to transfer to UW and do the rest of my prerequistes there before I apply into the math department instead of staying at home and finishing the prereqs at CC. 

Does UW take in transfer students as pre-majors or will I have to finish all prereqs at CC and then apply directly into the major?

I really want to get into UW and have a good shot but I applied to Informatics so I might not get DA.

I know CS is a no go if you don't get DA but if you're a student interested in Informatics or IS in the foster school is it stupid going to UW over UWB.

 However, I really don't want to go to UWB and would rather try my luck as a gen admit at UW and try to get into either foster or informatics. My main fear with UWB is that I've heard it's a really socially dead school. I don't care for the party scene I just want to meet cool people and be in a school where culture clubs have a good community that meets often.

 My big problem with general admission is that I am a running start student with all my info pre reqs done and most my business ones are too so I'm not sure what I would do at UW if they don't admit me into my major. If anyone has experience with this, I would love to know.

I know CS is a no go if you don't get DA but if you're a student interested in Informatics or IS in the foster school is it stupid going to UW over UWB.

I just want a change of environment that UW would give me and to meet all kinds of people in a bigger environment and I feel like UWB's atmosphere might not provide that, but I would love to hear everyone's thoughts.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1av2af2/is_uwb_a_lonely_or_depressing_place_to_be/,2,0,new

If you guys have your writing gen ed left, I would recommend taking ESS 101 for it in Spring. The writing portion is an essay on top of the normal assignments. I found it to be more interesting and fun compared to a typical English writing course. The class size is big so there will be a chance for everyone to register (online & in person). You won't need prior Geology knowledge to do well. If you have a high workload next quarter, this is a great class to sign up for. Professor Swanson is also the most enthusiastic prof I have had so far; no lectures are boring! You do one lab a week, a short reading, and there are two exams. There are also field trips and other extra credit assignments!

893,1at6ffd,Student Leadership Opportunity: Helping Homeless Communities,"Hi everyone! Wanted to share more about a leadership opportunity for those interested:

**Hearts for the Homeless International** is a student-led nonprofit organization that provides free blood-pressure screening opportunities and heart health education to homeless populations around the United States and globally. We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity! 

We are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.

The work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well. Some of our other significant achievements include leading an effort to rescue the homeless in multiple cities from hurricanes, partnering with Shark Tank’s Bombas Socks, as well as being published by [Forbes Magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2017/11/06/how-young-leaders-are-strengthening-community-responses-to-disasters/#77391a361850). 

We want to be able to help serve the struggling community of unhoused individuals in Seattle. According to the most recent 2023 [Annual Homelessness Assessment Report](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2023-AHAR-Part-1.pdf), Seattle is ranked in the top 5 for major cities with the largest number of people experiencing homelessness.

 I’ve been practically living at ode this week studying my ass off, and for two days in a row then the day of my actual exam people would come into one of the classrooms (where people go to study quietly or to discuss work quietly) as if it were a cafe? and just be loud and obnoxious? like even with my noise cancelling headphones it’s crazy how loud these ppl were, and they weren’t doing work or anything. 

Is ode now just a place to hang out now? has uw social life fallen that much? I’m a third year, and i’ve never seen this before- other libraries, sure, but odegaard is like where people go to buckle down and get shit done, yet there was fully a couple there for a DATE for valentines. for a lack of better words, what the fuck? sorry this is a bit aggressive for my tastes, but it was so damn irritating, like some of the conversations I was forced to endure were incredibly dull and hard to ignore.

I totally get going to ode and socializing in the common space, near the stairs and such where nobody is head down at a table grinding; But going to a room and sitting down at a booth to yap your ass off while everyone else in the room is trying to focus is so annoying. Thoughts anyone?


edit::: for clarification- I don’t have any issues with chatter and background noise and stuff, im talking about full volume and belting out laughing kind of volume

930,1ar3c7q,"Given my unique situation, should I be putting my graduation date as March or June of 2024?","Hi all,

I’m a senior who will be graduating this year. I’m in a unique situation where this is my last “real” quarter of classes, as in my last quarter where I will be attending classes in-person. I have finished all of the requirements for my degree and major, and I could have technically applied to graduate after Winter quarter. However, I will be taking a full-time credit course load in the Spring for two reasons: to finish one of my two minors (only one class remaining) and to be able to receive an additional quarter of the generous financial aid that has essentially paid me to attend school. So, I will only be taking one class for one of my two optional minors I have added on, and the rest will just be fun and easy electives to hit the full time requirement for financial aid. 

All of these classes that I am taking are completely online, and my classes for Winter quarter will be concluding at the beginning of March. As a result, I have been looking for full-time jobs starting immediately since I have the availability to begin my career early, and to get a head start versus having to compete with many more people who also will be graduating in June.

Here’s my question: on my resume, I have been listing that I am graduating in March of 2024, since I will have technically met every single requirement for my degree, both general electives and my specific concentration, outside of the one optional minor. Furthermore, I am afraid if I list June that employers will think I am not available until then and would reject my application thinking I don’t have the availability to start right away. This is something that if granted initial interviews, I plan on clarifying right away that while I could technically have my degree, on paper I technically do not, given the reasons above, but that I will in 3 months. I don’t want to “deceive” anyone, but given my unique situation I think I am better off putting March and then explaining my situation if I am provided an interview

I guess what I’m trying to ask is, is this okay to do? Am I technically lying? I don’t want employers to possibly think I am trying to be deceitful or something of the sorts. I saw a TikTok about someone who lied and said they had a degree and they didn’t when they were technically 6 credits short. They had gone through 3 interviews without disclosing it, and had their offer rescinded as a result. I’m not sure if that person was still actively in school or not, but now it has left me paranoid. Should I be putting June instead, even though I am able to start right now? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

We are a lab in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences here at UW and we are looking for **MALE ADULTS (ages 18+)** to participate in some research studies. (We are specifically in need of AMAB participants right now, but all genders are welcome!)

In general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do NOT stutter for a variety of experiments in which you'll be compensated $20/hr. We can reimburse for street parking and we will provide you with a free hearing screening as part of the experiment.

Most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words or sentences off a screen. Some studies involve measuring your brain function while you wear an electrode cap (just like a swim cap). We have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

If you are interested, or have any questions at all, please email us at [maxlab@uw.edu](mailto:maxlab@uw.edu)!

Thank you!

950,1aq0mw7,Hiring speeds in ‘23-24,"I’ve already searched the history of this sub to see what the experience is like and saw that they were supposed to be revamping their system to improve it. Anyone know if that’s taken place yet and what the experience is like more recently?  If you’re written off as not a viable candidate do you at least get the rejection immediately or are you left in limbo until someone signs the offer letter. 

This is my second experience so far with their hiring process and I feel like it was much quicker the first time but then again it was for a lower titled position. 

History:

I applied back in April of last year for a position. Got the email for an interview 2 days later and they wanted to interview the next day. Ended up postponing the interview by one week because one day left little to no time to get in the mindset for one etc. 

I left the interview feeling confident that I was able to articulate why I would make a good candidate and almost immediately after (same day) the manager asked for my references. I was able to send my ref to them quickly and they contacted them first thing in the morning the following day. Unfortunately for me I also got a call from my doctor that I would need an emergency procedure (such awful timing) and that recovery and follow ups would take 3-4 months. Knowing how fast things were moving (interview, reference checks) I knew I had to withdraw immediately which I did. They understood and encouraged me to apply again if/when I was ready.

Flash forward to December ‘23. I have fully recovered and everything should be fine, just requires routine monitoring etc. I applied again but everything moving at a much slower pace this time around. I applied in December but I know how places work and things freeze usually in December, not sure how or why they even posted it. I heard back mid Jan and interviewed end of Jan (3 weeks ago). I left the interviewing feeling not as confident. Not sure what happened but definitely didn’t go as well as my one in April. They didn’t ask for references immediately at the end either and I wrote it off as them remembering having spoken to them already, or that I bombed. A week after the interview (2 weeks ago) they ask for my references and I send almost the same ones but I’ve added my medical director.  Only issue now is that they have yet to contact any of them?  Not sure if that’s a good sign or not?  They specifically told me they would contact all the candidates and notify them of the decision which I interpreted as please don’t bother me with follow-ups but I’d really like to know where I stand. My career is pretty niche especially for the PNW so my opportunities are slim so im pretty dead set on this one. 

I currently work at public health/learning institution so I’m familiar with slow and red tape issues but my current one is at least allowed to notify the candidate that the offer is coming it just takes time to draft it (unless my manager goofed).",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1aq0mw7/hiring_speeds_in_2324/,3,7,new

\- I LOVE seafood, hiking/camping, water activities, and skiing. I know it'd be harder to fulfill all of these requirements in Providence or Ithaca compared to Berkeley or Seattle...

\- I plan to go into academia, and would very much like to become tenure track. Unfortunately, I have heard that prestige and legacy really do open doors in academia. Genuinely asking (because I'm truly ignorant about these things), how recognizable is the UDub name? How prestigious is UDub's MCB graduate program? Would I have to do my PhD in Fred Hutch to turn heads, or would other partner institutes and UW campus labs also garner major respect? 

\- At this point, I have fairly equal labs/PIs of interest at all 4 institutions, so availability of research interests are not a limiting factor in my decision",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1apfply/why_udub_and_why_not_uc_berkeley_brown_or_cornell/,12,0,new

969,1aot826,Geography Data Science: Everything You Need To Know,"Hello dawgs,

If you're reading this, you either didn't get into a major or you're a freak that likes maps. Either way, it's going to be okay. 

I'm writing this because there is a severe lack of student resources about the Geography Data Science major, and it is an open major which creates a lot of questions.  So from the coursework to the department to the career prospects, I am going to give you everything I know about being in GDS.

**How do you know if GDS is for you?** 

You need to have a passion for data visualization, coding, and maps. It is a great technical degree in a growing industry.

First of all, the Geography department is a relatively small department of students and faculty that is hidden on the fourth floor of Smith Hall. From what I've seen, Geography coursework is separated into two categories. Half of the classes are more humanities-based geography classes focused on the historical, political, and socio-economic aspects of geography. Highly interesting, but nothing technical. The other half are data science classes focused on developing maps with custom software and scripting languages.

Geography Data Science is a Bachelors of Science degree. An audit will require that you take a shit ton of 300 level Geography classes, intro CSE classes, and a machine learning course(s). 

**The classes I have taken in order of importance:**  
GEOG 360: intro mapping class focused on an open-source mapping software, QGIS. Somewhat tedious, maybe a little boring, but highly important.

GEOG 458: taught by the same prof as 328, another class that teaches more advanced techniques for geospatial web programming. The projects you build in this class can be pretty professional. HTML/CSS/Mapbox/ArcGIS API JS/Node.js/PostgreSQL. Also a choose your own adventure and teaches you a lot about mapping ethics.

GEOG 328: teaches you how to create web based visualizations using javascript/html/css and Mapbox. Great technical add and covers a lot of material. Projects are great for a portfolio.

GEOG 465: introductory SQL class teaching you how to map using a PostgreSQL backend. Highly important for full-stack coding, a little tedious at times.

GEOG 450: a Python course focused on creating Seattle based visualizations that have nothing to do with maps. Teaches python scripting, web crawling, d3.js and more. Not the most necessary class but certainly helpful.

Favorite profs: 

Gunwha Oh: the dawg, super sweet Korean lady that cares about her job, her students, and maps!

Bo Zhao: the beast, this guy makes maps like a mofo. Best laid-out classes in the major. All on github.

&#x200B;

**Career Prospects:**

* Level One: ArcGIS monkey, using ESRI products to build out data viz. This is the most simplistic, most common way to perform GIS and the lowest paying.
* Level Two: GIS Web Dev, create geospatial applications using full stack.
* Level Three: Geospatial Data Scientist, be a god of the domain. Basically, just a data scientist with a geospatial stack, creating data pipelines, viz, applications, and ml models. 

There are infinite ways to make money in geospatial. Just think, the more skilled you are the more you are likely to get paid.

Where Can I Work?:  
Any tier-one company, of course. Anything that has to do with maps. I noticed a lot of government jobs require highly specific geospatial web app skills. Even Pokemon Go hires Geography Data Scientists. Look up ESRI as well, this is one of the largest mapping companies.

classes I have heard about:

Urban GIS, GEOG 317 and a few others are all ESRI based classes using ArcGIS. Supposedly teach you some cool stuff with an industry staple software.

10,n0rlj3,[Opinionated Overview] The whole beef between the ASUW and The Daily is so incredibly messed up and it makes me so angry.,"**UPDATE:** I have posted a follow-up thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1e3kz/a_followup_on_my_opinionated_overview_and_how_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that includes detailed instructions on submitting complaints and a petition to resolve problems surrounding the sending of the email.

[The cartoon in question](https://preview.redd.it/yvd4q5t2ozv61.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90dfd1f3c40f2ead992a6a457b65913ace3b830)

So I, like many of you received an email from ASUW (from which I am not subscribed to any newsletter) about racist imagery targeting certain UW students. My first thought was that it was probably some right-wing cartoonist who posted a problematic opinion piece that crossed the line, but I couldn't find it because it seemed to have already been removed. You can see it above here. The general consensus amongst students who have problems with this is essentially that this cartoon compares the majority BIPOC candidates to animals (along with a food truck and public art piece).

Before I move on and explain why I don't think this is a comparison or racist at all, let me give you the context for the cartoon that the mass-sent email left out. The Daily is a student-run newspaper that always posts their candidate endorsements for the ASUW elections, which is UW's student government. This year however, likely due to Covid-19 and people not being as involved and on-campus, the tickets for the major races stand completely uncontested with one unofficial opposition ticket. The Daily this year decided to not endorse any of the candidates, specifically stating that ""This year, The Daily has decided not to endorse any of the candidates,  all of whom are qualified for their respective positions but, based on  their performance, are clearly not prepared."" I *highly* encourage you to read the full endorsement article, which can found [here](https://www.dailyuw.com/opinion/article_98fe0652-a645-11eb-8917-a7c8c54dae46.html). You will find that while the writers have both positive and negative opinions on each candidate, they still choose not to endorse any.

Now here is where the cartoon comes in: since all of the elections are uncontested, the article pokes fun at this fact by suggesting write-in candidates consisting of iconic UW imagery. Any student who has been on campus and many who have not had the chance will be able to recognize these ""candidates"" as staples of the UW's campus culture and jokes pertaining to them have been common for as long as they have existed. Now, the medicinal herb garden monkey seems to be the animal people are most upset about, and it does not help that it is one of the more niche UW icons. If you are unaware of the monkey, you can read about it's history and see pictures of it [here](https://magazine.washington.edu/monkey-business-the-story-of-the-uw-medicinal-herb-garden-and-its-guardians). Considering all of this information and context, I am hard-pressing in seeing the angle that many critics are presenting that the candidates are being ""compared"" in any way to these animals which only make up a portion of the suggestions.

Ultimately, The Daily removed this cartoon from their publication and issued an open-letter apology to the ASUW. If this is where the controversy ended, I would move on and not make this post but I am sure most of you reading this are aware of the email that was just sent to all UW students from the ASUW.

Today, the ASUW president issued an email to all UW students under the subject ""ASUW Response to the 04/26 Post from The Daily"" which claimed, without any context provided, that The Daily had published ""racist imagery from The Daily surrounding the current ASUW elections"". I, like many of you, went to the subreddit and my friends in both The Daily staff and the ASUW to see what had happened and after which found a cartoon that was blown significantly out of proportion by the ASUW.

I am extremely disappointed that the ASUW leadership would abuse their power to email every UW student, regardless of subscription status, to paint The Daily as racist out of nowhere to the entire student body over a few student's perception of one cartoon from one artist. The Daily is a student-run organization that staffs many POC's and has always supported progressive student movements, protests, and actions. It is completely unfair for them to have someone with the power to email every student claim that they published racist imagery after the cartoon was removed and people can't even see the what was posted anymore. How is The Daily even supposed to defend themselves if the narrative can be so easily controlled by one side? The calls for The Daily to ""do better"" than the apology by donating from their already limited budget to things like mutual aid is outrageous and completely unnecessary. I saw one student say that ""y'all gotta pay reparations anyway"" so the POC staff for The Daily better open up their wallets, I guess.

There needs to be consequences for whoever approved this abusive and manipulative email to be sent to the entire student body like this. All it has done is put the safety of The Daily staff in jeopardy and given fuel for right-wing pundits to use to indoctrinate even more people who have an irrational fear of cancel culture. However, I for one do not want to wait for action to be taken and call for people to write in ""Dubs I"" for every position to show that we are not okay with this kind of behavior from those who are supposed to protect and lift up our student organizations who fight for just causes, especially the press which highlights many civil rights and social justice issues facing the students in our school.

&#x200B;

TLDR: The ASUW president sent an email to every UW student out of nowhere and with no context claiming that The Daily is racist over a cartoon that was no longer publicly available, unfairly controlling the narrative of the situation and putting the safety of the publicly listed staff of The Daily in jeopardy.

44,ffajy9,DO NOT come to UW if you want to do CS but are not DA,"**PSA: If you are dead set on studying Computer Science at UW and not directly admitted to the major, DO NOT COME HERE.**

Since it’s UW admission season, and many soon-to-be college freshmen are looking to study Computer Science (CS), I’d like to give some of my thoughts about why anybody who isn’t a direct admit (DA) and is looking to study CS should steer clear of coming to UW.

First of all, if you were admitted to UW Computer Science as a Direct Admit freshman, congratulations! I highly highly highly recommend coming here to study because UW CS is pretty much cream of the crop, and you’ll have a great time here.

This post is meant for everyone who applied to CS and was admitted to UW as a pre-sciences student, or applied to Computer Engineering and was admitted as a Direct to College (DTC) of Engineering student.

As a 3x CSE reject, I will try to explain this to the best of my ability. If there’s anything that can be improved, let me know in the comments and I’ll edit it.

In an effort to accommodate the large demand for CS and to avoid having students go to UW for a few years only to not get into CS, the Paul Allen school moved to a mainly DA system in 2019. This means that almost all people studying computer science at UW will be DA freshmen from now on. So if the Computer Science program admissions were competitive before for current UW students, it’s hell now. [Even the UW website tells you to go to a different school.](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm)

Here’s some attitudes I had as a CS-hopeful freshman that got BTFO’d after being in UW for a year and a half (I’m a sophomore now).

**“Oh, I’ll work hard and I’ll get in for sure!”**

And so will everyone else. I’m sure you’ve all been getting 3.9 GPA/36 ACT/1600 SAT, and a ton of 5s on AP tests with no problem in high school, and expect to keep getting top scores in college. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN IN COLLEGE! You are now in a school where everyone else is as smart as you. Your study habits that got you an A in high school will land you a 2.6 in Physics 121. Even if you do somehow land a 4.0 GPA, it STILL might not be enough to get into CS. Searching this subreddit will show you some people with ridiculously good grades and extracurriculars who still got rejected from CS.

Your whole grade is determined by 2 or 3 exams, because homework counts for shit. If you want to get into CS, you need to get a near perfect score on every single exam. The margin for error is about one or two problems on every test, meaning if you fuck up big time on one problem on one exam, especially in CSE 143, it’s over. I fucked up on a recursion problem and a stacks and queues problem on my CSE 143 midterm and it was enough to bury my CSE admission chances into the ground.

Your grades are also highly dependent on luck. Just take this quarter, for example. One of my friends got below average on the CSE 143 midterm and wanted to use the final to pull up his grade. It just so happens that the entire school has now shut down due to coronavirus and the CSE 143 final is cancelled, so he’s fucked. Professors and TAs also grade differently and have different teaching materials. This is a lot of variability when every single point on every single assignment and test matters when you’re trying to get into CS.

**For DTC admits:**

This section is for all of you freshmen who applied for Computer Engineering (or any other engineering major) and got ""Engineering Undeclared"" status. If you got Pre-Engineering, you are not in the College of Engineering and this section doesn't apply to you.

Now, you College of Engineering admits might think, “oh, I got DTC, I’m set lol” THIS IS NOT THE CASE. If getting into CS through the regular pathway is at a 10/10 difficulty, getting into CE through DTC is like 9/10 difficulty. It’s possible if you get near perfect scores on everything and have an outstanding application, but I’ve known multiple people who’ve had a 3.8 GPA with a 3.5+ CSE 143 grade get rejected from Computer Engineering [One look at these DTC admission statistics](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement/data) should tell you that literally everyone else also thought they could get into Computer Engineering through DTC and that it’s by far the most competitive engineering major. This year, I’ve talked to countless people who applied to just Computer Engineering in the first application cycle and ended up in Electrical Engineering this second application cycle. [Even the College of Engineering website says that DTC isn’t a good fit for Computer Engineering or bust people.](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/directtocollege/faq) When you apply for a major through DTC (called “[placement](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/placement)”), you pick 6 majors (you can pick less, but then you’re not guaranteed a major) by the order in which you want to study them and then the admissions officers pretty much pick your major for you out of that list. You’re guaranteed at least your last pick. If you don’t accept what they give you, they will KICK YOU OUT of the College of Engineering. They’ll try to tell you in your E-FIG that eNgInEeRiNg iS InTeRdIsCiPlInArY, but the similarities between Computer Engineering and Environmental Engineering are laughable. If you get into DTC and you’re going for Computer Engineering, get ready to select Electrical Engineering as your backup major.

**“Oh, I can get into a backup major that is pretty much just like CS!”**

[Here’s an overview of some CS-related majors.](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/overview/related-majors)

I’ll go over four CSE backup majors here.

**Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences (ACMS):**

If CS is a 10/10 difficulty to get admitted to normally, then ACMS is like a 9/10. It’s also super fucking difficult, because you will have to study a ton of math that CS majors won’t have to. This is a really good option if you’re into data science, machine learning, and other applications of mathematical computing but it’s a small department and almost as hard as CS to get into.

**Electrical Engineering (EE):**

EE is not very hard to get into if you’re DTC (like a 3.0 GPA will be good enough if your application is strong), but ironically it’s probably a harder major to study because of all the extra math and physics. EE is not the best major to study if you’re only interested in becoming a software engineer. Most EE concentrations don’t have much in common with CS curriculum, and you’ll be spending most of your time building circuits and studying continuous math rather than looking at discrete mathematics and data structures. The Embedded Systems track is probably the closest you can get to studying Computer Engineering as an EE student; however, I’ve heard that it’s a niche field within CSE.

**Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE):**

HCDE pretty much only accepts DTC students now. [They had a 13% admit rate this last cycle.](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/bs/admissions-faq)

HCDE is a great major, but it focuses almost solely on user design. It is a program for people looking to become UX/UI designers, not for computer scientists. Some front-end development skills are covered, but don’t expect any algorithms or computing theory or anything that will really prepare you for a full stack development or software engineering job from this major.

**Informatics:**

IMO, Informatics is the best backup for aspiring software developers. You won’t learn much theory but you’ll learn a lot of full stack development skills, design skills, cybersecurity skills, and more, depending on what track you decide to study. Admissions are actually holistic and don't focus on grades heavily, so even if you get a 3.0 in CSE 143 you’ll still have a good chance. However, every single CSE reject is also applying for Informatics and it is insanely competitive. I took Info 200 this quarter and my professor repeatedly stated that they turn down many qualified applicants each cycle just because there is not enough space to accommodate everyone.

**Other Backup Major Advice:**

There are some other majors like Geographic Information Systems but at that point you should think about if you really want to study Geography or if it’s best to just cut your losses and transfer to UW Bothell.

If you’re thinking about just loading up on CSE non-major classes, while being in another major, it might be better just to go to another school. The non-major courses vary in quality since they are not the courses CSE focuses its time and effort on (that’s reserved for the major courses). CSE 373 is good, but I’ve heard the rest of the non-major CSE classes can be very variable in quality.

If you plan to pursue a backup major, make sure you’re actually interested in the backup major. After all, you’ll be spending most of your time studying that major and not CSE courses.

**In conclusion**, it is not worth the time and effort to pour 2 years of your life into polishing every single line of code to perfection and fretting about every single lost point on every assignment/test at the cost of all other parts of your life just to be handed rejection after rejection from the CSE department. Don’t make the mistake I made. I was accepted to CS programs in multiple schools around the country, but I turned them all down to go to UW since it was my top choice. I have spent countless hours regretting going to UW and agonizing over what majors I could still apply for after CSE was no longer a realistic option. Thankfully, I was admitted to a major (see flair) I am interested in studying, but I know many people who are in a much worse place than I am. I hope this post gave a little insight for those of you who have been admitted to UW and are still deciding on what school to commit to.

**TL;DR: if you are dead set on studying CS, do not come to UW Seattle if you were not directly admitted to the major. It is virtually impossible to get admitted to CS and you would be much better off going to another school to study CS.**

He looked to be in his late teens to early 20s, over 6' tall, black (light brown skin), shoulder length dreadlocks, and a bit on the heavier side.

I called transit security and 911, and they both told me that this guy has done this to multiple women over the past several days at the U District station.

Still very exhausted from an emotional day of trying to figure out what to with my shrimp babies.

93,tbo3hn,2:30am harassed w/ taser by red square,"open note to the two assholes who buzzed a taser at me approx. 2:30 this morning: fuck you.

hopefully the intended audience sees this but if not, some context: i was walking myself from campus back to my room really late. walking up from drumheller, i saw a couple in front of me (other students, probably freshman or sophomores), walking in the same direction towards my dorm. i was at an awkward distance behind them, not super close, but close enough to consider speeding up to pass. the girl kept looking back at me weirdly and i thought she might be uncomfortable so i decided to pass them w/ a good amount of room between us. understandable, it was late at night, i didn’t want to make her paranoid walking behind them and i also was irritated at her looking back at me so much like holy shit seriously learn how to mind your business.

after i pass and am continuing to walk faster to create space, they start saying shit about having a taser, i guess as a warning? they said that they would use it on me if i came at them or something and started laughing like it was some sort of joke. then scared the shit out of me by buzzing it, which apparently they thought was funny too because they were joking around. i didn’t acknowledge them even as they continued to laugh at my expense, lowkey scared they would be stupid enough to actually attack me with the taser if i engaged.

keep in mind that nothing about me screams threatening: i’m a 19 year old girl, 5’1” and i was wearing sweatpants, a lanyard, no dark clothes and had my backpack on - literally peak tired college student attire. i understand being apprehensive at night but they turned a non-situation into borderline harassment.

anyways, fuck both of you. i was minding my own business and that was incredibly humiliating and scary. like middle school bully level shit. hope that you both fail your finals and have a terrible spring break fr. manifesting it 🙏🙏",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/tbo3hn/230am_harassed_w_taser_by_red_square/,32,508,top

106,v47zub,"So, HBO is Limiting Disability and General Access to Your Building","Hi everyone! I know we've all been very annoyed with how UW Photography (as a division of UW Marketing and Communications) and HBO have been affecting movement on campus this week. Including intervals as long as 10-15 minutes yesterday where the director refused to let students through sets including over wheelchair accessible ramps and doors WHILE yelling at students to take off their masks.

I am here to share some resources, emails, and advice to direct your anger over anything from being late for your finals to film crews parked in fire lanes and blocking access to wheelchair accessible entrances and pathways on campus.

First:
RECORD EVERYTHING. if you genuinely want to hold UW and HBO accountable for their glaring ADA errors here, take pictures and videos to document exactly what they're doing.

BE CONFRONTATIONAL but non-violent, they have no legal authority to prevent you from traveling anywhere on the campus of a university to which you pay tuition.

Now upload it.

Next:
EMAIL. Flood the inboxes or the following people for whatever they caused or can resolve.

Studio Manager (for UW Photography) Pamela Dore
pdore@uw.edu
According to multiple representatives from UW Marketing & Communications / UW Photography, Dore is the person responsible from providing access to and greenlighting activities of the production on campus.

HBO On-Set ADA Representative, Mark Freid
markafreid@gmail.com
This guy is supposed to work to ensure HBO remains ADA compliant.

Director / Campus Filming & University Photography, Alanya Cannon
alcan@uw.edu
Alanya is responsible on behalf of the university to ensure ADA and other issues do not impact students in and around the production.

filmoffice@seattle.gov
All film productions of this scale go through the Seattle Office of Film and Music to get permits, etc.
The DO NOT enable them to block accessible pathways or park in fire lanes.

These people all have phone numbers, too, so please use what you are comfortable with.

Finally:
Share this post. The more people who come here and find resources to share the issues they've encountered with the production, the louder we are, the quicker they fix it.

Here's my understanding of the situation because people deserve more clarity than what admin is saying.

Before I begin, use these guides:

[Spring Quarter Overview](https://www.washington.edu/provost/springquarter/)

[Housing and Food Services](https://www.washington.edu/provost/springquarter/)

[Registration (Classes)](https://registrar.washington.edu/2020/03/26/spring-quarter-2020-covid-19-faqs/)

[Financial Aid](https://www.washington.edu/financialaid/2020/03/20/covid-19-faqs/)

They're going to answer \*almost\* any question you have and they are the starting point for my inferences.

I am a Senior on the Services and Activities Fee, we set the SAF, IMA, and FRF every year, not tuition or other fees but I can shed light on the process. This is grossly oversimplified.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit for added clarity, 3/29/2020 6pm**

Many of the tuition and fee items are determined at the state level a year ahead. The UW itself does not operate independently. As a state school, budgets for various sections of the university are presented to the Board of Regents, and some must be approved by the state legislature. Making any tuition change cannot happen just with the President, without legislative, or at least, board approval.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best way I can think to do this is go one by one on each item in your tuition bill.

# Operations Fee (Tuition)

**What it is:** This is what people think about when we say tuition. It gets divided up among the different colleges and departments based on enrollment. The money funds mostly faculty and some staff as well as educational costs. For In-State students, the State of WA picks up about 2/3 of this tab but out of state students and international students pay full price. This money also pays for all University operations like Ana Marie's salary and UW IT (who are very busy these days).  The UW gets a lot of money from donors, our endowment, and from athletics... BUT NONE OF IT PAYS FOR SCHOOL. All of that money pays for extra stuff like new buildings and scholarships.

**Why it won't go down:** All the money tuition goes towards still has to be paid out. (ex: faculty are on salaries). The only way it will go down is if someone else picks up the tab. The State of Washington could as could the Federal Government but that's about it.

# Building Fee (Tuition)

**What it is:** This pays for what the state and donors don't, but it keeps the lights on. Literally. It funds custodial staff and regular building maintenance, plus some other stuff.

**Why it won't go down:** The buildings may be used less but the custodians are working harder than ever. The labs can't shut off, nor can the servers, security systems, custodial offices and grounds keepers. There will be very little electricity savings in comparison so we'll get nothing back.

# [(Student) Technology Fee](https://uwstf.org/)  (STF)

**What it is:** This is a mandatory fee that Seattle Campus students voted to give ourselves and it funds all sorts of cool stuff like DawgPrints, Charging Stations, and even new cardio equipment at the IMA. It is administered by a committee of students who allocate funding and increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** The money has already been sent out to projects and programs that are helping students even though we're not there. Most notably the [Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/) [which gives out FREE laptops to students this quarter so they can still attend class remotely.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgPeMw-hL7w&t=0s)

# [Services and Activities Fee](https://depts.washington.edu/safcom/about.php) (SAF)

**What it is:** This is very similar to STF but it funds the operations of 17 different, student-facing units on the Seattle Campus. These include essential services like [Hall Health](http://depts.washington.edu/hhpccweb/clinics-services/primary-care/), [The Counseling Center](https://www.washington.edu/counseling/), and [The Food Pantry](https://www.washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry/). It also includes things that are closed like [the IMA](https://www.washington.edu/ima/) and the [HUB](https://hub.washington.edu/). Some units will save a little money on student wages this quarter but they will still pay lots to their professional staff. The money also funds [ASUW](http://www.asuw.org/), [GPSS](http://depts.washington.edu/gpss/) and [The Daily](http://www.dailyuw.com/) which are still very active and especially important right now. It is administered by a committee of students who allocate funding and increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** Because the funding is allocated annually and although some units will save money, others won't. The savings will just go towards next year's programs and or special online programming this quarter. Even if we could reduce it for one quarter (which would be hard because it's an annual allocation), we are bound by state law to keep fee increases under 4% annually so any decrease now screws over all future students because the units would be dramatically underfunded for a few years.

# IMA Bond Fee

**What it is:** This fee is used to pay off a 30-year loan issued to the Students by the UW Internal Loan Program (UW internal bank) which funded the IMA building renovation in 2004. Right now, the SAF Committee is planning on using this fee to fund another [30 year loan to remodel the IMA pool and locker room](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/7gigks/uw_recreation_wants_to_hear_from_you_about_a/). It is administered by the SAF Committee who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** This fee pays off a loan and unless the loan payments are deferred for the quarter, the money must still be collected. The UW board of Regents may be able to authorize a temporary hold on payments to eliminate the fee for this quarter, but I doubt that will happen.

# Facilities and Renovation Fee (FRF)

**What it is:** This fee is used to pay off a 30-year loan issued to the Students by the UW Internal Loan Program (UW internal bank) which funded the Hall Health, HUB, and ECC building renovations in 2012.  It is administered by the SAF Committee who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** This fee pays off a loan and unless the loan payments are deferred for the quarter, the money must still be collected. The UW board of Regents may be able to authorize a temporary hold on payments to eliminate the fee for this quarter, but I doubt that will happen.

# [U-PASS Fee](https://transportation.uw.edu/getting-here/transit/student-advisory-board)

**EDIT 4/6:** [U-PASS has been waived for the whole quarter. You will get a refund for if you already paid it. If transit services start charging again before the end of the quarter, students will be able to purchase U-PASS at the employee rate.](https://transportation.uw.edu/news/u-pass-update-spring-quarter)

**What it is:** This fee, which was voted on by students to give to ourselves, goes directly to local transit agencies so that UW students have almost unlimited access to transit in the region. The funds are allocated to each agency based on how many students used that service. (which is why you still have to tap your husky card instead of just showing the driver your card). Most students don't use all $88 of value they paid for per quarter, but almost every commuter student uses way more than that. In general we subsidize transit for those who need it most. It is administered by the U-PASS Advisory Board (made up of students) who increase/decrease the fee with approval from the regents.

**Why it won't go down:** IT MIGHT!!! Most transit agencies that U-PASS is apart of have suspended fares during the shutdown because ridership is very low and they don't want anyone going near the drivers. (You enter from the back door of buses). Because of this, even if a UW student were to travel by transit, they won't have to tap their card, and thus, the transit agency wouldn't get any money from the U-PASS pot. This means that we probably don't need to pay the fee for this quarter.

**EDIT 3/29 from** **A student who knows a lot about the U-PASS program budget**

>In addition to student fees, which make up most of the program, the U-PASS is paid for in part by money from the central budget office & money that is overflow from parking revenue.  
>  
>The money from the central budget office is equal to 10% of the program costs with the caveat that it is capped at 1.8 million dollars.  
>  
>The parking money, called Transit Demand Management, is supposed to make the U-PASS program whole. However, just like the money from the central budgeting office, it has a cap. (I believe the cap might still be in some negotiation, but right now, as far as I know, it is as follows: a maximum of 62% of TDM may be paid to the U-PASS program of total TDM parking revenue).  
>  
>Basically, with campus shut down, the U-PASS fee might be able to be put on pause, but it probably won’t generate any surplus or something if the fee doesn’t end up getting waived. And the random and arbitrary caps to the aid the program receives from the university will be reached  sometime in the next two years (according to estimates) so there will be some fee increases for students.  
>  
>The U-PASS program provides like $500 value for $80 per quarter and even with substantial increases to the fee it would be “worth it” to many students who commute. Plus, the last time the fee was raised was 2016 so it’s been a little while.

Lab Fees/Class Fees

I don't know much about Class Fees but it is really dumb that these won't be eliminated, especially if the money was for supplies you won't use. Some classes have lab fees for computer related things and that will, of course, still apply. So far it seems bad but do the following and we might be okay.

**What can you do about all this?**

[Drop out for one quarter. (this is not free)](https://registrar.washington.edu/2020/03/26/spring-quarter-2020-covid-19-faqs)

Contact the UW with any specific issues you have with your situation. [Emergency aid is available and can cover fees.](https://www.washington.edu/emergencyaid/)

Contact ASUW to unify as a student body for State and Federal Support.  [This is actually where the petition comes in handy because it shows high volumes of student support.](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-washington-seattle-partial-tuition-refund-for-spring-2020-at-uw?cs_tk=AnQRv_-s-jPXPv3Ng14AAXicyyvNyQEABF8BvGuLAuh6p1_zwOEWpNyxKWQ=&utm_campaign=36c897f15b8a4f649da65dd56d175e86&utm_content=initial_v0_0_1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=recruit_sign_digest&utm_term=cs&fbclid=IwAR3eibloZJeoOI_xjPFKxiOajb-bGT2LfgxRGpxaST3tcHZnx1Lz53IVDOM)

Contact your state and federal representatives and ask them for support.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [UW Housing](https://hfs.uw.edu/Coronavirus-FAQ-for-Residents)

HFS is offering to not charge any student who won't be on campus for spring quarter housing with no fees for cancellation. The deadline for this request has passed but you can still contact them. Those students have to move out by May 3rd to not get charged. They will also not be charged for a dining plan. This is particularly impressive considering how much of your housing amount goes to paying off the 30-year loans they used to build all the new dorms. I'm sure they have it figured out, but this is actually a big deal.

# [UW Food](https://hfs.uw.edu/Coronavirus-FAQ-for-Residents#UnspentDining)

This is an issue because lots of people have leftover money on their dining plans that they were planning on using during spring quarter, myself included. They will give a partial refund but not a full one mostly because HFS does not take ANY MONEY AT ALL from the state or from tuition. They need dining revenues to cover costs like the chefs and custodians at their dining facilities. They will basically give back all the money they saved by not having to feed 10,000 people for the last two weeks of winter quarter but that won't be the full amount because there were still lots of costs. HFS donates almost all its leftover food to the Food Pantry too, so don't worry about anything being wasted.

# Off Campus Housing

The state has so far not issued a freeze on rents but they have issued a freeze on evictions so if you can't pay and can't get your stuff right away, you will have time to come back. Most landlords should be understanding. [Here is some helpful info on your rights as a tenant.](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/husky-neighborhood-project/landlord-tenant/) Lots of people have begun the process of finding a subletter for their space now instead of waiting until the end of the quarter. The Facebook groups offering these are pretty saturated and there isn't a whole lot of demand but it's worth a shot.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/fqylrn/why_we_still_have_to_pay_full_price_for_tuition/,37,444,top

Take a second to breathe. Mentally ground yourself. 


My Mom was subconsciously suppressing her emotions caused by the pandemic for an entire year which landed her in the hospital for the worst panic attack that manifested as psycho motor retardation and we didn’t know what actually was wrong with her until her third visit where her panic attack manifested as a pseudo-seizure.

My point is, if you can’t keep going next quarter, don’t. The pandemic threw out whatever self or societal imposed timeline you have to follow. Do what makes you happy. Do what makes you feel healthy. Take care of yourself.

Don’t fucking grind your life away for an institution that’ll say your name once and then never again after you yeet yourself off the aurora bridge.

I have been a part of this restaurant business since when I was born, since I attended UW, since I graduated, and since I moved on to my own full-time job. I enjoyed my time occasionally working there at the register, wrapping musubis, chugging the chilled hawaiian suns, and bringing my nintendo switch to play with my UW friends. I have also worked on the menu, website, point-of-sale system, and many other things behind the scenes. While I have not lived as long as the restaurant's existence, the memories felt eternal as Hawaii BBQ has deeply influenced my life, and our family's life. One of the earliest fondest memories I had was when the restaurant still over at the old location (50th ave), my sis and I would sleep and play at the restaurant all day. Now that my parents are retiring, both happy and sad for our family, this restaurant will finally see its end. It is time for me to start taking care of my parents. Thank you all for your patronage and thank you for making my time there enjoyable.

ps: i know this post is very sudden but i would encourage you all to visit in person before it permanently shuts down. also the online ordering systems sucks (fees and all), you can always call to order ahead. we'd prefer if you try our dishes fresh :)

258,oq8s6q,Advice for students moving to campus for the first time that I wish I was given when I was a freshman.,"HFS gives stupid advice and product recommendations. Your RAs are knowledgeable, but they're not the ones in control of the handbooks or websites. This is a collection of random tips I've accumulated in my time living at UW, and from friends of mine at UW and other colleges.  

&#x200B;

DORM SUPPLIES:

&#x200B;

***DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OCM. I ASSUME HFS GETS A CUT OF SALES, BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS ARE GARBAGE.***

&#x200B;

For bedding, look on amazon, there are tons of Twin XL (the size UW beds are) options there for far cheaper and with a better return policy than OCM (The company HFS shills for). Buy a pillow online, at Target, or bring one from home. I promise you they will be higher quality than OCM.

&#x200B;

For towels, go to Target or, if you can, Costco. The towels at Costco are dirt cheap and VERY high quality. Buy two bath towels and a dish towel. You can buy a bath mat, but I would just dry off in the shower and save the $8. 

&#x200B;

**For any kind of kitchenware, GO TO TARGET.** I was able to buy one bowl, one plate, one dish, one fork, one knife, and one spoon for cheap. I recommend bringing some kind of thermos or travel mug to fill up on the free coffee in the dining halls in the morning to avoid buying the exact same coffee at Starbucks for $5. 

&#x200B;

Miscellaneous tips:

\-***DON'T BUY THE EXPENSIVE DINING PLAN.*** I was duped into thinking it was the best option before I set foot on campus (you've probably read the HFS guide saying that anything less than the level 4 will leave you without food half the time, that's complete bunk.) The food on campus is OK at best and very cheap. A meal costs around $8 at most, more with sides, so the $1100 or whatever the level 1 is plan will cover quite a lot. 

&#x200B;

\-Additionally, you're in Seattle. You're a 10 minute walk or a 20 minute bus ride from some of the best food in the world. Don't waste all your college meals on a greasy sub-mcdonalds quality burger. 

&#x200B;

\-Your dining account can be used at the District Market (on-campus grocery store). I wouldn't use actual money here, as its almost all 10-40% more expensive than any other grocery store, but it's a good way to burn the money you won't want to use on junky fast food. 

&#x200B;

\-**Amazon is your friend.** You will forget things. You will break things. You'll be living in Seattle so 90% of packages will be able to be delivered next day, or if you're really lucky, later the same day. If you don't have prime but your parents do, have them set up Amazon Household, which will give you access to free prime shipping.

&#x200B;

\-**Bring batteries and lightbulbs.** These are both weirdly expensive around the University, so buy them and bring them.

&#x200B;

\-**Lighting is a must.** The dorms can get really dark and depressing, especially in overcast Seattle winter, which is all of Seattle winter. I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to spend $50 on a ""mood lamp"", but some fairy lights, desk lamps, floor lamps, or, if you're so inclined and your roommate doesn't object (ASK FIRST) TikTok style LEDs.

&#x200B;

\-On the same line as Lighting, **bring a plant**. Studies have repeatedly shown increased mood, energy, and focus in people who have leafy plants in their environments as compared to those who do not. Pothos, Lucky Bamboo, and Fiddleleaf Fig are all pretty cheap and easy to care for. Spend 10 minutes researching them so you don't kill them instantly and you'll be golden.

&#x200B;

\-Laundry. Doesn't have to be Tide, but **any laundry pod is a lifesaver for dorm laundry.** You don't want to haul a 2 gallon jug of detergent up 5 flights of stairs (unless you're trying to get a leg workout in, in which case go for it). I have a collapsible hamper so I would often bring my laundry down with a pod or two, start it going,  put the hamper in my backpack, then go get lunch on the AVE.

&#x200B;

\-**If you need a mini fridge, see if you can buy used.** I paid $50 on Facebook Marketplace for one that retails for $200. It's a little late now, but graduates often get rid of theirs at the end of the year. Facebook Marketplace is a great place to start looking. 

&#x200B;

\-**Get a Coffee Maker / Electric Kettle.** Either of these will pay for themselves in a month if you drink a lot of Tea, Coffee, or Cocoa (also good for ramen).

&#x200B;

If you're not sure if you'll need something or not, err on the side of conservativism. Dorms are small. You don't want to be like I was and have a bunch of storage bins full of junk I never used, or even wanted to use. Save your money on the front end, don't buy a rice cooker and a, instant pot and an air fryer and a frying pan and 50 other things ""just in case"". If you realize you need something, buy it on Amazon, or go to the store. If Seattle seems expensive, hop on a bus (if I recall correctly the 522 or the 255 will work) and go to Bellevue, Kirkland, or Redmond. On top of seeing more of the area if you're not from here, these towns can be much cheaper (also typically safer for walking alone but that's another issue for another post) than anywhere in Seattle, and unlimited bus fare is included in Tuition. 

&#x200B;

**Off topic but maybe helpful bits of wisdom**

&#x200B;

**-**I always keep a few $1 bills in a pocket with nothing else in it when I'm walking around. This way, if one of the many many beggars around the AVE or Seattle in general comes up and asks, or worse, demands money, I can hand them a small amount without pulling out my whole wallet or risking dropping stuff. You will be asked for money. Sometimes, you will be asked for money in a very forceful way. One wants to assume these are people down on their luck with the best intentions, but the reality is some are dangerous. **NEVER PULL OUT YOUR WALLET WHEN GIVING AN UNHOUSED PERSON OR BEGGAR MONEY.** Many are good people on bad times, some are not. 

&#x200B;

\-This applies to anyone, but especially those who are women or minorities of any kind, and those who are less physically intimidating. **Avoid walking alone** off or near campus. The campus proper is fairly safe, but you go one street in any direction and all bets are off. Do not walk alone, do not walk with headphones on, and do not walk at night. Ensure bags are secure and closed. Probably, you'll never have a problem. Expect the best and plan for the worst. 

&#x200B;

\-**Don't study in your dorm**. I could wax poetic about sleep hygiene all day but it boils down to this: Don't use spaces for all purposes. Sleep in your sleeping space, relax in your relaxation space, study in your study space. There are libraries for studying. They're very nice. Use them. You will be more productive, I promise.

&#x200B;

\-**Find your people.** Don't rely on highschool friends alone for socialization in college. Join a club you're genuinely passionate about, not that you think would look cool to be in. Personally, I've made all my friends at UW through Dungeons and Dragons. Anything that forces groups of 3-6 people together to interact on any personal level will absolutely build relationships. I might make a whole other post about this later. 

&#x200B;

I didn't set out with the intent to write this long of a post (In fact this was originally going to be a 1 paragraph psa about the dining level) but these are genuinely all things that if I had known going into college my first year I would have been much better off. Hopefully this will help at least one person with at least one thing and if it does, it was worth it. If you have any other tips (the real LPT is always in the comments) I'll add them to the list with credit. Feel free to repost or plagiarize any of this, if it would help more people know what they're doing.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/oq8s6q/advice_for_students_moving_to_campus_for_the/,67,383,top

I've already contacted my professors and my advisor but I honestly I don't know if I'll ever be able to go back to my normal schedule. I can't even do schoolwork because I feel so guilty about thinking of something else besides her. Please tell me this gets better

Edit: I want to thank everyone for your kind words and advice. My mother may no longer be with us but it means so much to me and my family that there is so much support. I don't know how long it'll take me to become emotionally and mentally stable, but I know that my mother would want me to continue school and enjoy life.

289,no0q4b,Safety on the Ave,"I am usually more of a lurker than a poster but I wanted to draw attention to the fact that a lot of women do not feel safe walking near campus. 

I can only share my own experiences but typically when I have experienced catcalling and unwanted attention near campus (the Ave in particular) it’s usually men who are obviously older and more than likely don’t go to UW. Just a few minutes ago, however, I had an interaction with a guy who was definitely of student age so I wanted to address it here. 

Some context. I enjoy walking alone, it provides me some clarity in my typically hectic life. I know that can leave me “more vulnerable” but I take necessary safety precautions (even though I shouldn’t have to). I’m walking down the Ave with my earbuds in and suddenly a guy crosses the street diagonally — IN FRONT OF CARS during a green light to cross over to me. Honestly I didn’t think much of it until he tapped my wrist and gestured for me to take my earbud out. I did and then it’s a spew of “wow, I couldn’t help but notice your beauty and...” and I panic and start walking away. I had to keep turning every block or so to make sure he wasn’t following me, I was still on edge when I started writing this. For everyone here I would love to share some words of wisdom: when a woman — or anyone really — is walking alone (I don’t care if it’s night or day) approaching them while they are alone is already a bit sus and TOUCHING THEM is an absolute no. It’s not flattering, it’s invading personal space. Also — if you do happen to compliment someone in this setting — you are not entitled to a reaction. 

That’s my piece for today. Good luck with finals everyone <3",PSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/no0q4b/safety_on_the_ave/,43,365,top

354,n0s58t,The ASUW-Daily spat - more than you think. Recall Camille Hattwig,"The other posts on this are missing the bigger picture - ASUW president Camille Hattwig used the allegations of racism to draw attention away from The Daily's reporting on her nearly fraudulent election practices.

Here's how it down in the context of the election:

1. ASUW doesn't advertise deadlines or other info for the upcoming election so it consists entirely of ASUW insiders running unopposed
2. The Daily calls them out for this
3. Camille fabricates allegations of racism against the Daily to try to delegitimize their very reasonable concerns about the election. In her (somewhat alarmist) email to the entire student body about this, she leaves out any specifics because then people would see that her claims are ridiculous.

I know ASUW is kinda a joke, but it's entirely inappropriate for an elected incumbent to try to delegitimize reasonable criticism from the press about an election. And something really did go wrong with this election - 100% of positions consisting of unopposed insiders shows they used unfair pre-election processes.

Camille should be recalled for this - if any of you know how to get that started we should work on that.

429,nakstt,RANDOM ADVICE FOR FRESHMEN,"here is a random jumble of advice and info I wish i knew/thought of before coming to UW (much of this is dorm related)

 

* 8 am in high school is very different from 8 am in college. Unless you are absolutely sure that you are a morning person--like the type of person who wakes up at 6 a.m.--do not take classes before 10 a.m.! 
* Get the lowest level dining account. If you find you need more money you can always level your account up, but if you start with an expensive dining account and you don't spend the money, you're screwed.
* You might not like your roommates. It's fine. Even if you talk to them for months before, sometimes it just doesn't work out and that's okay. It happens to a lot of people.
* Closet measurements: that rack for hanging your clothes is 32 inches. (hope this helps y'all not overpack)
* Worried about storage space? Grab yourself one of these bad boys at a very reasonable price from target: https://www.target.com/p/11-8-cube-organizer-shelf-room-essentials-153/-/A-51256587?preselect=15113339#lnk=sametab 
* Don't know who needs to hear this, but you do not need to bring that many pairs of shoes. 
* Bring several towels. Ideally thinner ones so they dry properly.
* Clothes you *need*:  a good rain jacket. Ideally two. Two pairs of rain shoes, either waterproof or water-resistant. That's right, you will thank me for this.
* Don't bring tide pods. The washers don't get hot enough for them to melt. 
* Bringing posters? Scotch mounting putty works great for hanging them on dorm walls! Tape… not so much. 
* Get a minifridge, get a good one! You do not really need a microwave, every dorm floor has two microwaves so you're not going to have to walk super forward to access a fancy and high-quality microwave. 
* You will in fact need a power cord--the outlets are few and far spread so if you plan on having a lamp, your computer, a clock, and phone plugged in at your desk, you will need this. 
* Buy one of those eye masks for sleeping and practice sleeping in it. Well look stupid and it's not the most comfortable at first, you and your roommate will thank me when it's 2 a.m. and you want to sleep, and they need to have the lights on so they can stay awake and cram study for a test.  no matter the brightness or what time of day it is, you put that sucker on, and it's pitch black and perfect for sleeping.
* there is no AC in the dorms. you have a heater in your room but the highest I can go is 74 degrees. It autoshuts on at 55 degrees. Thus far it has not gotten hot enough that I would want AC but just a heads up it isn't an option.
* Bring lights. Lamps, string lights, anything. The dorm lighting sucks and the rooms are so gloomy, dark, and depressing. 
* There will be very little daylight during the winter months. Some days, if you sleep in late and wake up at 3 p.m, you open your blinds to find it is already dark outside. During these months make sure you get up and experience a few hours of sunlight a day or you will get seasonal depression. It's very real, and it sucks. 
* ALEKS is evil. Learn to fear and hate the name, chances are you'll understand later. 
* Sometimes there are homeless people wandering around West Campus. Most of them are chill, some of them are weird. Sometimes the front of the dorm buildings smells like human urine.
* The dining hall food sucks. Buy yourself a pan, pot, spatula, knife, mixing bowl, and cutting board from target or Ikea or somewhere in case you ever cook. That's honestly about all you need....
* Bring a vacuum. And a duster. The dorm's floors get so dirty so fast, and the room gets so damn dusty from the vents. 
* Do not overload your schedule! College classes are a lot more self-taught than High School. Balance is important, for everyone hard class you're taking, balance it with a passion class or a fun class your first quarter to allow yourself breathing room to adjust. Pair your chem class with a film appreciation class or psychology of human sexuality, and your bio class with ceramics or creative writing. You get the idea.
* Do not hook up with someone on your dorm hall floor, rookie mistake and it is awkward for the whole year. I did not do it but I know too many people who did eek
* Spreadsheet, spreadsheet, spreadsheet! Canvas and it's annoying to use in my opinion, the only way I kept from forgetting assignments as I spent hours the first day of school making a spreadsheet ordering all the assignments, tests, quizzes, and projects to speak to a spreadsheet organized by date. Then throughout the quarter I just stayed ahead and crossed stuff off the list.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/nakstt/random_advice_for_freshmen/,29,319,top

459,t8bcvt,It's that time: the annual 'go to community college (seriously)' plea,"The post title is tongue-in-cheek, but hear me out. There's a lot of sincerity in people telling you to do this.

It's admissions season, and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're one of thousands of freshmen who didn't make the cut for admissions this year. And that sucks. There's no diminishing it, especially if you're like many UW students who were a part of some Honors or AP program that was priming you for the Straight to College pipeline, and telling you that anything less was abject failure.

(Or maybe you just have Asian parents.)

I'm here to tell you why community college is a perfectly valid path that'll still bring you to the UW, how to make it work for you, and if I'm doing a good job, you might come to find it was the smarter decision anyway. This is coming from someone who applied to UW in his senior year of high school and, having finished that last semester with a 1.7 GPA, predictably did not get in. It was pretty devastating: high school sucked, and as a little baby gay, I couldn't see myself being happy anywhere but Seattle. I applied again a decade later (you don't need to wait this long) having job experience, an AA earned with highest honors, and a much clearer direction of where I wanted to take my life - and these have been among the best years of my life because of it. So not only am I writing this to the freshmen who were hyped and pumped up to get here, but I'm also writing to people who also have started to wonder if college was in reach for them *at all*: because of their abilities, because of a garbage high school experience, because their family is poor, etc. **You can make it happen.**

I work with other CC transfer students *a lot*. It's not all sunshine and daisies, but there are minimal regrets - and a number of commonly-cited reasons as to why community college was the best decision for them:

**1)** **$$$**

The big one everyone will talk about is money, and for good reason: **a single 5-credit course at UW costs about as much as a full-time quarter at a WA state community college.** On the whole, you're going to spend about a third as much on your first two years compared to someone who went straight to UW. Unless your family is already wealthy, this is a pretty attractive point to anyone - and it's half the reason why, as a first-gen student, grad school is even a future possibility for me. 

Bonus for OOS (non-international) students: CC tuition isn't that much more expensive for you compared to the baseline (~$130/cred vs. $116/cred), while UW would have you paying 3-4x as much - to the point that many will tell you to just not come here OOS unless you're mega-wealthy. For OOS students, this can be a great opportunity to establish yourself & work towards residency, but that is a *whole ass process* you'll want to talk to the professionals about.

Further: community colleges usually have foundations that collect and hand out scholarships like candy to students with big aspirations, while here the odds can be so long you might have a better chance fighting the other applicants to the death in the gladiator pit under Condon Hall.

**2)** **Better Academics**

Big prerequisite classes for more competitive majors - math, bio, chem, the works - are colloquially called 'weedouts', with pretty brutal exams and grading curves. A quick search on this sub will show you what the experience is like. Many of these can be taken at a CC and transferred in - and you'll probably have a more accessible professor, classroom aides, and a class size about a tenth of what you'd find here. Even current UW students will often dip a CC course during the summer just to avoid how utterly miserable they can be here.

Beyond skipping weedouts, WA state CCs are among the best in the country. Many CC professors very much teach foremost out of a passion for helping their students.  For the first time in my life, I didn't hate math, and I was able to ace statistics - which was unthinkable for me at the time (and UW straight up taught me to hate it again anyways lmaoo). I took biology with a professor who I later learned had began at that same community college, went to UW for undergrad microbio with awards for research excellence, and went on to get his PhD. He played chill Hollow Knight ambience during our exam days. Honestly, I'll probably remember more of my CC profs than my UW ones by the time I'm in my career field.

**3)** **Easier Accessibility**

This is a broad one, but: unless you're taking out loans or coasting on your parent's dime in the dorms, making an education happen at UW is *hard*. Seattle has a high cost of living and many students have to live outside and commute 1-2h every day. Prior to the pandemic, the university basically went out of its way to *not* offer online courses, while many CCs have them as a staple. The time and money you save just by not having to struggle to *be* here are resources you can put into yourself, your extracurriculars, and planning out your transfer to make the most of your time here.

**4)** **Lots of involvement opportunities**

This is true at UW, too, but it's just more accessible here. Become a student leader, go work with student life, get hired as a tutor, join a robotics club. Tied in with the Accessibility bit above, you'll have more room on your plate to volunteer or intern somewhere. CC is no different from UW in this regard, though: to make these things happen, you have to go search for them. People will tell you that the degree you get here matters a lot less than the connections you made or the opportunities you embraced, and IMO that same message rings true for your community college experience.

**5)** **Life perspective**

This one is ambiguous, but bear with me. My very first community college class was English 101. I sat a table with an international student from Japan, a 40-year-old military veteran who was working on getting a degree in machining, and a woman in her late 20s who I later learned had been on the streets for about a year before transitional housing became available for her. By the time the quarter started, she'd been off the streets for just a month. In the span of her two years there, she'd go on to study IT and get an internship with T Mobile, who later hired her for about $70k starting.

When you sit in a stuffy lecture hall at UW with a bunch of college-bound kids from career college families, you rarely get these kind of stories. You don't get the same perspective on how 'Success' can mean different things to different people, how it's equally as valid, and the sacrifices some people have to make in order to make their education happen. Where's UW on the US News College Rankings? What's your SAT score? Did you apply to Ivies? At that table, *nobody fucking cared*. It's hard to describe how valuable that lesson is: the way it changes how you see and interact with other people, how it reframes your perspective on yourself and your education, and what it all means to you. You've probably spent 4 years on a rat-race gifted high schooler track; step off it, just for a little while.

This experience translates to your time at UW in a way that professors notice, too. Professors fucking love transfer students. They've got life experience, tend to be less full of anxiety and bullshit, and are often among the best participators in their classrooms. Student & campus jobs will love you, too. There's transfer shock, sure, but when you get here, a lot of transfers feel pretty ahead of the pack, and if they planned their transfer well they get to drop right into the heart of their major's core classes.

----

Getting through your two years at CC is one thing, but if you can do that, honestly the path forward is simple:

1. Use your time at CC to explore majors and figure out what you want to do.
2. Take some time to think about how your desired career path impacts the world, or a problem or disadvantaged communities in it. There's a world beyond academia: engage with it.
3. Get involved, somewhere. Bonus points if it's tied into the above. Think about how that's relevant to your desired career path.
4. Go to class. Get those grades.
5. Write a bomb-ass essay that ties all the above together, and show them how dumb they'd have to be to *not* take you.

If you have your heart set here, for whatever reason, and didn't make it in: go to community college. Seriously. I hope the ramblings of a former lost teen help at least one person out there also feeling like a lost teen today.",Admissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/t8bcvt/its_that_time_the_annual_go_to_community_college/,26,314,top

462,lkfa1d,Protecting the health of students learning in different time zones: a letter to the UW administration,"*This message is being sent to Ana Mari Cauce (the President of UW), the Daily of UW, and the general audience.*

Dear UW Administrators,

I am writing this letter to raise awareness of the challenges on the health of student learning in different time zones. In this letter, I present those challenges and potential solutions to mitigate those problems. I invite the UW administration to take actions to address those challenges to build a more inclusive global community.

**Executive Summary**

Amid the pandemic, many students have to learn in different time zones synchronously under current university policy, compromising their health. University policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced to protect the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones. Established policies such as the elimination of attendance for grading need to be enforced. Policy changes should focus on making time schedules of assessments and discussion sessions more flexible.

**Background**

Amid COVID-19 pandemic, students have to stay at home and learn remotely in different time zones inside and outside of the US. Most international students, especially, experience drastic time differences when trying to attend lectures and exams live from their home countries.

Attending classes live with hours of difference is not easy. For students studying in Hawaii, a 8:30 am PST class translates to attendance at 6:30 am local time. For students studying in East Asia, a 10:30 am PST class could mean staying up late 2:30 pm \[correction: am\] late night every weekday. Such time difference not only translates to disadvantages when learning materials and taking exams, it also disturbs the students’ circadian clock, causing adverse effects on the student’s physical and mental health.

The adverse effects are not theoretical, nor are they overstated. On February 8th, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute grieves the passing of Kaijie Zhang, “a first-semester freshman studying remotely from his family home in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China” \[1\]. Taking classes at night and its associated adverse effects are allegedly the main cause of this tragedy. To prevent such tragedies from happening at UW and for the health of all students learning in different time zones, university policies on remote teaching need to be revised and enforced. I am confident that these problems will be addressed because “the health and safety of our students, staff, faculty and academic personnel is our University’s highest priority,” writes our President Ana Mari Cauce in her message “The safety of our community is our highest priority” \[2\].

**Problems and Recommendations**

*Time Schedule Planning*

While synchronous classes with diverse time schedules and asynchronous classes could solve the problem, they are not realistic in large scale because of limited teaching resources and limited learning experience, respectively. However, I suggest the university to explicitly encourage the planning of lecture and quiz sections (if they have multiple sections) at very different times.

For instance, many courses currently offers section A at 9:30 am and section B at 10:30 am, providing students little time flexibility. Instead, the policy could encourage planning of section A at 9:30 am and section B at 4:30 pm, accommodating for students from different time zones.

I understand that such strategy may not work for all courses because of limitations such as their sizes, instructor availability, and time conflicts. Nevertheless, a small change in the schedule could benefit a large population of students. In addition, FERPA-compliant recordings of synchronous lecture should be required to be uploaded to the cloud for students all students for reference, giving all student the possibility of asynchronous learning.

*Exam Policy*

Another issue that students learning from different time zones face is awkward exam schedule. If a course is offered synchronously, regardless whether its materials are posted for asynchronous learning, its exams are usually strictly synchronous, without exceptions (other than that required by university policy). For example, a student studying from East Asia may have to take an exam 3:30 am local time at night for an unnegotiable exam time of 11:30 am PST. Again, such late time is not only an disadvantage to academic performance, but it is also poisonous to the students’ physical and mental health. This is easily understandable: if student do not expect instructors to teach late night to accommodate for students in different time zones, then instructors should not expect students in different time zones to take examinations late night.

As a concrete example, many exams in the Department of Chemistry must be taken synchronously, without exceptions for students learning in different time zones, because instructors “see less issues with academic ethics & integrity if all students take the exam concurrently.” Even worse, it is quoted as a departmental policy. This would not be a problem if classes were in person, but remote instruction has to consider of time zone differences to be inclusive of students learning in different time zones.

Synchronous exam policies have to be changed. I recommend exams for remote learning to have a time window of 24 hours to start the exam, providing students from different time zones an equal opportunity to perform in their time zones. Indeed, such policy may raise concerns on academic integrity; however, policies should not punish students who did nothing wrong: the time zone students are in are not in their control. In contrast, the choice to adhere to the honor code and take the exam with honesty is in the hands of every student. In addition, student who decide to cheat in asynchronous exams is likely to cheat in synchronous section regardless, having no correlation with whether students learning from different time zones should have a fair time to take the exam. Therefore, exam policies need to be changed so that every student has an equal opportunity to demonstrate their performance and a healthy schedule without late night classes.

*Enforcement of Policies*

After appropriate revision to the university policies, those policies need to be strictly enforced so that the students can benefit from those policies to have a flexible learning experience. If no enforcement is placed and no feedback channel is available for students, students would not be benefitted from those policies. Thus, I recommend the university to establish ways for students to provide feedback and express concerns on remote teaching related to course policies to the administration level (independent to those mid-quarter survey that are for instructional feedback).

*Attendance Policy*

Here, I present one example of the consequence of the lack of policy enforcement: the attendance policy is not practiced by instructors. The university policy on remote teaching has a clear guideline on grading synchronous attendance: “Attendance – Don’t factor in attendance as part of grading” \[3\]. However, many instructors still grade attendance directly or indirectly. Take an Organic Chemistry course as an example, its grading takes synchronous Poll Everywhere responses as 4% of the total grade, stating that “you will only be able to answer the questions during lecture, not while watching the lectures on Panopto later on,” forcing students to attend synchronously without considering students learning in different time zones. As a solution, I recommend quarterly inspection of course syllabus as a part of policy enforcement, in the hope that instructors will follow university policies, just like students should follow university policies, too.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, university policies need to be revised and enforced so that the physical and mental health of students learning in different time zones can be protected. The change to university policies can also provide more equitable examination opportunities. I invite the UW administration to respond by taking concrete actions to improve the policies, building a more inclusive community.

My first year was extremely rough I literally failed a class each quarter and I started regretting and questioning my decision to come here. Maybe the UW admissions staff was right in the first place? Maybe I should’ve gone to WSU, idk. This last year though I really started trying to get my crap together, and I really started to just focus on what I wanted to do instead of what I was expected to do. It wasn’t a perfect year but my gpa slowly recovered. After all my hard work and finally being told that I belong here.

533,gg7sy7,From Cheating in CSE 143 to a Full Time Programming Role,"**As I am seeing that many admission decisions are coming out I thought now would be a good time to share the (success) story of my journey at UW, which is coming to an end this quarter.**

  
Like many hopefuls I came into the UW hoping to do Computer Science. I had built my own computer in High School, I thought coding was fascinating, I saw that it was a field that was employable and paid well. Like many up until I started at UW I didn't really realize the work it took to be successful, and I wasn't prepared for the competitive nature that UW cultivates. 

By the end of **my first year** I knew I would never be a CS student. I took CSE 143 that winter with my roommate, we were both struggling on an assignment and he sent me an ""example"" of a past quarter's submission found online. As I soon found out, you can change every single variable name and you will still get caught. The program they run is able to see the structure of the code and compares it to their database of submissions. That crushed me, and was one of the hardest lessons I had to learn my Freshman year. Having to own up to my own mistake and look past it shook my world for the better. We both got caught and I don't blame my roommate at all.

I was able to finish the prerequisite courses to Informatics just in time to apply my Freshman year. I wrote a piss-poor essay which I was revising with 10 minutes left to the deadline. In retrospect of course I'm not surprised at all that I wasn't admitted, but at the time I was still partially in the mindset that life would just work out for me. 

After getting rejected my **Sophomore year** with an actually well written and revised essay I was heartbroken. In my head I still was set on Info as my backup major and didn't have another backup, I didn't have the prerequisites or grades for ACMS or any Math heavy major. A friend of mine had recommended GIS in Geography as a tech-related alternative and by the end of the year I was a declared Geography Major. I still wanted to program for a living and still was hoping to get into Info my Junior year. I had it calculated that I could take Info classes on the side and still graduate in 4 years if I was admitted then.

So many students I see on this sub-reddit put an incredible emphasis on getting into their major. Which is a great goal to work towards, but it isn't the ""end all be all""! I finally came to realize around this point that *my Major wasn't what was going to get me that desired job after college, it was the skills was able to gain and retain from my studies*. This was when I got my first internship paying minimum wage at a research center downtown to help add data visualizations to their website. I got this through applying to nearly every data science related *Undergraduate Research Program listing.*

For my **Junior year** Informatics essay I was actually so ticked at the system that my essay was about how my Major and grades don't define my capabilities in life. haha! Long story short I didn't get in then either, and was officially going to be graduating as a Geography Major. I continued to take Informatics and the non-major CSE courses that I was able to get into and began applying like crazy to internship roles for the next summer. I likely *applied to over 100 roles mostly on sites like Glassdoor*. I got my second internship at a recreational equipment company working on their employee management system/database. Around this time I also secured a part-time engineering internship at a telecommunications giant that would go throughout my senior school year. When I applied and accepted these Internships my resume still had Informatics as my intended major even though I was denied from the program a few weeks afterwards. 

This might apply to tech more than other majors but *don't think that because you didn't get into your major you aren't qualified or able to get that role you want or be successful in the future*. Fight through it and apply everywhere! **Work experience is so much more valuable than any major title or course.** 

The Geography major is not incredibly technical and even though I'm seeing this Data Science option that has been recently added to it, after looking at the courses, it's not that much more intensive. Geography courses all hold your hand through the material and if you do major in I highly recommend going above and beyond. I was able to take every single non-major CSE course except for AI and the photography one. In Informatics I was able to get the Android, iOS, and Server-side courses (don't take professionalism), many people assumed I was in the major.

For a while I regretted not transferring when the Geography major initially disappointed me, but in retrospect two factors made staying worth it, the reduced in-state tuition (probably saved over $50,000 in debt), and simply *the amount of opportunities in Seattle*. All my internships were located in Seattle and being able to be at school so close gave me the opportunities to go to interviews (of which I got rejected from many) and eventually find internships. 

This Summer I start work full time as a Diagnostics Engineer writing programs that monitor and help to maintain cell phone service around the country, I get to work with massive amounts of data, and am making a 6 figure salary right out of college. To everyone who has been rejected from any major, know that it isn't the end of the world and you can and will bounce back.

548,n1x6tf,(Semi-opiniated) summary of last nights ASUW BOD meeting,"During the first \~15 minutes, some BSU representatives speak and thank Camille and the ASUW board for their ""professionalism."" Followed by member of the public asking ASUW why they sent a mass alarmist email to tens of thousands of people. Camille says they're ""not doing back-and-forth"" and doesn't provide a response. (I'm unclear if this is standard for public forums, so maybe give her the benefit of the doubt here?)

Bulk of the meeting (over an hour) was about pretty standard/hiring/administrative stuff. 

Time was allocated at the end for the board to discuss The Daily. One of the board members asked about the email, why it was sent out, and who knew about it. Camille said she met with ""all relevant stakeholders"" prior to the email being sent. Board member pushes a bit more on the stakeholders question, Camille says it's not an appropriate discussion for a board meeting.

Board member asks if she met with The Daily, as they are a relevant stakeholder. Camille waffles a bit, and says that yes, The Daily was consulted prior to the mass email being sent. 

(Wild accusation: based on the context here, I got the feeling that she was misrepresenting the truth. The Daily's response doesn't really line up with what she was saying here, and she made it very clear that she was more concerned with stakeholders other than The Daily. )

Camille speaks about her rationale for sending the email. She argued that since the original racist cartoon was sent to every student, she needed to send a follow-up response to every student. Says that it's important to ""show support for the students being harmed by the institutions at play."" 

(Look, I don't know about the rest of you, but I regularly see The Daily in my inbox. I don't regularly see alarmist emails from the ASUW president. There was no fucking reason to send this spam to everyone.)

She went on and explained that the BOD candidates have the least amount of power in this situation, because The Daily can reach tens of thousands of people, so she felt compelled to use her power to do the same to support the candidates. She said her biggest concern and the point of her statement was not ""what the public thinks,"" its the impact this has had on Black students. ""The goal was not to explain things clearly or make the broader student community understand.""

(It's true the candidates don't have access to a mailing list of the student body. But they will next year. To put it another way, they're unopposed candidates for public office, they are guaranteed to have power next year, no matter what The Daily does or says. It's frankly mind-boggling, then, that the current administration thinks its appropriate to step into this fight use their power to attack the press.)

Camille starts talking about next steps for ASUW, and what steps they can take to ""never worry again about students of color being targeted."" The board discusses options for potentially taking further actions against The Daily, specifically options to censure/censor The Daily.

(Okay, the wording is really important here, and even with context, I'm honestly not sure if they were talking about censuring or censoring. Regardless, either would effectively be a government action against the free press).

Then the board start talking about how much they appreciate The Daily's independent reporting. Camille says that critiquing the ASUW is well within The Daily's right (yet they continue talking about ""accountability"" measures.) The meeting mostly winds down after this.

Overall, I'm unhappy with ASUW's conduct and their attacks on The Daily are concerning at best. Curious if anyone else who attended the meeting has additional thoughts.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n1x6tf/semiopiniated_summary_of_last_nights_asuw_bod/,27,300,top

I don't know her. She held the door open so that I couldn't close it behind me and screamed insults at me. I don't know why but I just froze up... like everything got quiet. I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. 

This random guy suddenly appeared and interrupted her by saying, ""Excuse me."" He looked like he was trying to get past her into our building. I guess she got spooked, she finally turned around and left. The guy waited in the doorway until she walked away and asked me if I was okay. He then walked out of the building and left.

It was only after I got inside the elevator that I calmed down and realized he intentionally intervened to save me. I don't even remember if I thanked him.  

So if you are the random guy who saved me, thank you so much. You're very kind, and I'm so grateful.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/xejitq/thank_you_to_the_guy_who_saved_me_from_the_crazy/,9,298,top

I plan to arrive somewhat late to the exam and try to strategically seat myself in the middle of the room. My hopes are that my putrid body odor will distract exam-takers in the room there-by lowering the curve.

620,hxh9ju,"Going into 4th year, I'm going to miss the normal Autumn quarter.","The somehow-suppressed sound of 40,000 students walking in the light drizzle over the wet, fallen leaves covering the sidewalk near the Paul Allen Center.

Getting out of class at 5:20 to see it's already getting dark, but knowing you and the boys have a move ready for that Friday night.

Getting out of the IMA at 6:30 to see it's already dark, but knowing you and the boys have a move ready for that Friday night.

The random orange street lights around campus giving off that Halloween vibe, building up anticipation for the weekend coming at the end of October.

Shivering your ass off as you hustle through the bus-noisy streets at 8:20am.

Eating shit outside of Kane Hall because of a smooth leafy boy and having people to stare at you (as opposed to how empty it would be now. Eating shit not as fun when people don't watch).

Walking into a PACKED Odegaard while it's dark outside at 6pm.

Hope I described Autumn quarter well enough for the Freshmen heh...makes me wanna do graduate school or a 5th year 👀 or else I’m never ever gonna experience it again in my life. :(

654,per9vl,An open letter the University of Washington,"The University of Washington has condemned me and other disabled students with immune deficiency, as well as their families. Every 12 hours I take two medications to prevent my body from recognizing foreign solid organs that I received as part of a transplant. Because of this, I am more susceptible to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, something I have known for a long time. What many don’t know is that an additional consequence of these medications is reduced vaccine efficacy. I have received two doses, a booster, and have had COVID-19, and I still lack the antibodies to fight the disease.

The University of Washington, like many other universities across the country, has opted for in-person learning this fall. Most students and faculty are eager for the opportunity to be back on campus. However, the harsh reality for some is that the options provided by the university are subpar, dangerous, and are directly against access to learning for all students. I know I am not the only student with an immune deficiency, and I know that there are students with family members who are immune deficient.

The options before myself, as presented by the DRS, are as follows: hope that professors are willing to alter their course structures significantly to accommodate a single student, take less courses, request accommodations through the DRS which they have stated will be extremely limited and hard to acquire, or take the quarter off. Most of these place undue stress on students and instructors, both emotionally as well as financially.

With little over a month until the beginning of fall quarter, myself and my living partner have had no access to resources to protect ourselves from COVID-19 on campus. I have options, as listed above, however, my partner  — who sleeps next to me — has been told that there are no options for them, because they have no disability, making what little accommodations provided to myself useless so long as my partner must return to in-person learning.

I thank all the professors and advisors who’ve been corresponding with my partner and I this summer, trying to help in any way possible, and informing us that the university refuses to provide professors with guidance and resources for specific cases. This is the direct responsibility of the university, to provide guidance for student and faculty guidance, and reassurances that they will support all types of learning to guarantee that students can become educated in the safest and most effective way possible.

So while summer winds its way to a close and we continue to sit at home keeping our minds and bodies as active in any safe manner possible, the fall looms with unanswered questions, anxiety about more than assignments, and a sadness that the university I was once so proud to be a part of has become such a risk.

669,12xskne,My personal Ave foods tier list,"Happy to see some discussion over food on the ave, I've kept track of every meal I had on the ave in the past three years. The reason Seattle has no Michelin star restaurants is because there hasn't been a PNW Michelin guide, so there hasn't been an opportunity for any places to earn a star. Also, I use Aladdin's as the dividing line between A-tier and B-tier. I usually end up changing what I think of a place when I try more of their menu, so if there I particular dishes I have missed/should try, please let me know!  


A Tier:

YGF Malatang

I used to think I wasn't a soup guy, but a bowl of this on a cold, rainy day is one of my favorite meals in Seattle. I basically got a little bit of every option the first time, which ended up being pretty expensive, but still delicious. Haven't tried all the seafood, but in general I liked everything but the various meatballs/sausage. Highly recommend the gourd, tiny mushrooms, and the greens that look like chrysanthemum leaves for things I wasn't sure I'd like and ended up loving.

Chili's South Indian

Lamb Chettinadu Curry: Very good chicken, perfectly tender, perfectly spicy. Very flavorful. Portions were a little small, especially for the price. Had the chicken version later with a friend, also delicious

Malabar Chicken Curry: Had more veggies than the Chettinadu curry, which I liked. Also delicious.

The Alley

Spicy Pork Skillet: Everything was delicious, a lot of good sides. Second best value in a meal besides Saigon deli, but I think the price went up since the first time I've been there

Bugis

Hot Spicy Chicken Bowl: Delicious. Salad with good dressing, teriyaki chicken, rice, pickled onion, boiled egg. Fairly small portion of chicken and rice, salad was simple but very good. Whole dish came together great.

Vegetarian Tofu Bowl (spicy, noodles): Pretty good, the second-best vegetarian meal I've had on campus. Pretty standard egg noodle in spicy teriyaki sauce with broccoli and carrots. Outside of the tofu was really good, what really brought down the dish was that the broccoli, tofu, and sliced boiled egg were cold. You can solve this by letting the dish sit for a little, but it's still off-putting.

Mama's Viet Kitchen

Seitan Lemongrass: The greatest vegan dish I've ever had. When the dish came out, I was initially hesitant, as I don't usually eat vegetarian, and I like having a good amount of meat to go with my veggies. As it got closer, the smell hit me, and it was absolutely incredible. The vegetables also looked pretty great up close. On tasting them, they were perfectly, truly perfectly, seasoned and cooked. The only request I would make would be to serve the veggies right on top of the rice, so the rice has more time to soak up the flavor.

Chimac

Assorted Wings: Quality of the meat was really high, sauces weren't that good, dry rub was way better. Skip the corn. Pride chicken is delicious, chicken tenders are good, snow wings are a really good dry rub

Cedar's

Naan was pretty good, samosas were really good, lots of filling. Chicken was very tender.

Village Sushi

Sushi Regular: Good variety, it was all delicious. The wasabi was very good.

Shultzy's

French Dip Cheesesteak: Coleslaw was vinegary, fries were very thin, which was good but hard to eat non-messily with ketchup. Excellent meat quality and quantity, perfectly balanced with onion and swiss cheese, bread and au jus was great, they only give you half a roll which wasn't great for the price.

Jai Thai UW

Crispy Garlic Chicken: Delicious. Chicken was very good, perfectly crunchy, saucy without being soggy. Vegetables were perfectly cooked, the carrots, broccoli, and other greens were delicious. The entire dish came together fantastically.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

B Tier:

Aladdin Gyro-Cery

Aladdin Veggie Roll: Not great. Falafel was delicious, but the whole roll was a little dry and flavorless. The baklava was large, and pretty good.

Aladdin's Special Gyro(Lamb and Beef): Very good, a bit less greasy and more salad-y than Sultan Gyro Grill, could be a plus or minus depending on the person. Ratio of meat to sauce to pita to greens was perfect, meat was tender and salty, garlic sauce was very good.

Falafel Sandwich: Surprisingly little falafel, incredibly dry, not very saucy. Basically a falafel salad sandwich.

Kofta Sandwich: Not good, basically just a burger patty with tahini

Aladdin Fries(lamb): Delicious, lamb was perfectly tender with a thin but excellent crunch around the outside. Drink water with it or you'll mummify, maybe a few too many fries but some people love the fries so who knows

Voula's Offshore Cafe

Little Squeaker Sandwich and Potato Salad: Very good, meat was a bit thin and not tender, but flavorful. Bread was good, and soaked up the perfect sauciness. Tomato went well with it, and I don't like tomatoes. Potato salad was balanced between creamy and firm, I really liked the red onion in it.

Country Fried Steak: Eggs were good, hashbrowns were decent, english muffins were very good. Gravy was alright, country fried steak was alright, a bit salty but it goes well with the egg and hashbrowns.

Costa's

Original Eggs Benedict: Really good, I don't really like ham but it was still good, that's how good it was.

Next to try: Kotopita + Galaktoboureko

Ivar's Walk-Up Salmon Bar

Chowder Bowl, Fried Scallops, Fried Clams: Pretty good greasy spoon fare, view out front isn't great, bridge is very loud

Henry's Taiwanese Kitchen

Three Cup Chicken: Pretty good, rice in the sauce was delicious and the greens were good, but the chicken wasn't very tender. It was like a very sweet soy sauce, but not quite teriyaki.

Pho Shizzle

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki: Good size, chicken was a bit too crispy for me, flavor of the teriyaki wasn't great, could have had more salad. The side sauces were really good.

The Alley

Spicy Pork Bulgogi: Pretty good overall, good presentation

Byrek and Baguette

Ground Beef Byrek: Meat pastry, blackened around the edges, cold by the time it was served.

Roasted Pork Baguette: Delicious, reminds me of Un Bien, maybe not quite as good but also a lot less messy, so easier to eat without feeling self conscious.

Kai's Thai Street Food

Pad Kra Tiem: Pretty good, not really very memorable though.

Sultan Gyro Grill

Kufta: Alright. A little greasy and salty, hot sauce was good, great texture overall.

U:Don

Pretty greasy noodles, good prices on some items. Not exactly fine dining, but still pleasant comfort food.

Mee Sum Pastry

Mongolian Beef: Solid Beef + Onion dish, very tender beef

Sweet Alchemy Ice Cream

Sweet Cream: I'm not an ice cream person, but it's the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had.

H-Mart

Only place I've found Meiji chocolates, so it gets an honorary spot on the list

Saint Bread

Saint Burger and Cookie: Saint burger was a single patty, shredded lettuce, cheese, pickles, aioli. Best buns I've ever had, perfectly toasty. Excellent, simple burger.

Been back with friends a few other times, I think the burger's the best thing I've had

&#x200B;

C Tier:

Saigon Deli:

BBQ Pork Sandwich: Delicious bread, egg was a little runny. Great ratios of ingredients, bbq pork wasn't noteable.

Aladdin's Burgers

Beef and Lamburgghini: Decent smash burgers

Little Duck

Beef Fried Rice, Mushroom and Chicken Soup, Hot and Spicy Chicken: Soup was good, the rest wasn't great. Lots of bone pieces in the soup, hot and spicy chicken is basically spicy chicken nuggets.

Shawarma King

Lamb Shawarma Sandwich, Basbousa: Delicious, kind of a lamb burrito, perfectly flavorful and saucy. Basbousa was kinda gritty, but was also moist with a honey-sweet syrup, very good.

Lamb Salad: Not very good, salad was cold and wet which cooled down the lamb, the lamb was not very tender

Gyro Sandwich: Not good, nothing about it tasted great or really worked with any other ingredient

Chocolate Roll: Not very chocolatey, more of a fig-newtony kind of roll. Probably on the level of a nutrigrain bar.

Agua Verde Cafe

Chicken Burrito: Creamy, but the chicken wasn't very flavorful. Small for the price.

Chorizo Breakfast burrito: The thermal temperature of this burrito was sufficient to plasmify the air around me for ten minutes. The burrito was cheesy and greasy, not bad, a bit heavy for breakfast.

A Taste of Xi'an

Bean soup, hot oil pulled noodle: Pretty good, was definitely something new. Might try skewers next time

Mr. Bian Dumplings

Bian Dumplings, Pork and shrimp dumplings: A bit expensive for the volume. Shrimp wasn't very flavorful, bian dumplings were better. Overall kind of plain.

Guanaco's Pupuseria

Pretty small, good variety of flavors

Xi'an Noodles

Spicy Pork Noodles: Service time was pretty long, presentation is pretty poor but the taste is pretty good. Kind of felt like I could make it at home though.

BB's Teriyaki

Veggie Stir Fry, Brown Rice, Spicy Chicken, Spicy Sauce: Decent portion size. A little greasy, generally forgettable. Veggie stir fry was just wilted salad, skip.

Mark's Thai Food Box

Pork Ribs: Not great. Curry and rice wasn't very good, ribs were neither meaty nor tender. Dish was a little cold overall, the egg was the best fried egg I'd ever had.

Jewel of India

Mixed Grill, Lamb Samosas, Chicken Jalfrazie, Gulab Jamun: Mixed grill and jalfrazie was alright, nothing special. Samosas were really good, Gulab Jamun was too cardamom-y for my taste.

Nasai Teriyaki

Spicy Chicken: Pretty basic chicken teriyaki. Was made very quickly, which I like. A lot of people seem to really like it, maybe I got the wrong dish?

Ate O'Clock Thai

Hot Spicy Thai Basil: Not very spicy, veggies were alright but meat was fairly poor quality. Not worth the price.

Just Burgers

Tennessee w/ Curly Fries: A little overcooked, sauces were good and onion was delicious, but overall very greasy.

Thanh Vi

Banh Mi Combo: Short for a Banh Mi, the most generic Banh Mi I've ever eaten

Araya's Place

Veggie Cakes, Kaeng Ka-Ri: Good vegan food, and large portions, but incredibly expensive

Dubpop Asian Fusion

General Tao's Chicken: Not very good flavor on the sauce, pretty good serving size for the price.

Chipotle

Pollo Asada: They'll give you too much rice and beans if you let them put both on. Otherwise, pretty good burrito, Anita's on Aurora (and El Camion) are way better

Korean Tofu House Express

Bibimbap: Not a lot of meat, but sauce was good, so way rice + veggies. 

Time Bistro

Garlic Chicken and Rocket Shrimp Wraps: Bland, nothing special

Samurai Noodle

Tonkatsu Ramen: Not great. Salty/creamy isn't really my thing, the pickled veggie and pork weren't great, and the noodles were a little too squishy.

Cedars of Lebanon

Marinated Chicken Sandwich: A little bland, kind of like a chicken salad sandwich.

Panda Noodles

Veggie Fried Rice: A little heavy on the soy sauce, otherwise a standard bowl of fried rice.

Little Thai Restaurant

Clao Cook Gapi and Fish Cakes: Fish cakes rather bland, not very crispy. Egg was overcooked, maybe a bit too much rice for the beef, the portion was good overall but maybe not for the price. Beef was pretty good, got the second-spiciest level and it wasn't very spicy. They do have a fish tank, which is a huge plus.

Sushi Burrito

Dragon Ball: Criminally overpriced, even with the uw guide coupon. Pretty good, and didn't skimp on the eel, the shrimp didn't really add anything.

Samir's Mediterranean

Lamb Gyro: Spicy meat, a little bland on the whole",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/12xskne/my_personal_ave_foods_tier_list/,60,278,top

if they can send us cloth masks that people still use today, why can't they send us n-95's to protect us all? the inaccessibility to n-95's is so wrong...

687,e5sdhq,Daily Review: Burrito at Center Table,"Dear HFS,

On my post yesterday you said to continue sharing our feedback, I feel obliged: please accept my following review.

I got a beef burrito today, which soon became a bowl thanks to the creative wrapping. I quite liked it, the quantity was good.

However if I were to try improve on your recipe I would use a tortilla which isn't stale.

I might also find that it would be quicker and cheaper to go to Chipotle. Which is quite impressive considering both the distance and their desire to make a profit. 

I do also find it amazing that on ordering a sandwich you can get free avocado spread, but guacamole costs $2 in a burrito. I assume this must be due to the immense costs of the differing tools required in application. I might suggest trying to use the same spoon in the future? Just a thought.

Keep up the scam,

sometimes this randomly happens throughout the rest of the quarter, and each time, especially when it happens multiple times in the same day, is just as painful.
and when you try to join in, they treat you like a baldheaded cretin off rip, or they politely entertain your presence with a “yeah i’m gonna talk to my friend now”.
sometimes you’ll get a normal person to talk to, but in a class of 300-600, that’s gonna be like 3% of people.

707,13slm07,Reflection from a jaded senior (gatekeeping culture at UW),"because every facet of UW is competitive (major admissions, internships, jobs), most students gatekeep their resources and misrepresent their stats. I’ve often seen fellow students and even friends gatekeep their network, internships, resources. As a result, it’s extremely hard for someone without network to even know where to begin looking for internships and get their foot in the door. I especially feel this as a first gen immigrant, as my parents can only nod and smile when I tell them about school or my internship. As much as people don’t want to believe it or laugh at it, but privilege also comes from having well connected parents (or even parents who know about how the American society works). This is where I sound cynical, but it really is true when people joke that someone can make a call to their dad or their dads friend and get an internship. I saw a video where there is soft nepotism (or something along those lines), where young people benefit from having parents in the same industry as them. I see my peers having their hands held through the recruiting process because they have parents in that industry. 

looking back, I want to stress the importance of network to incoming students. resources are distributed widely in professional RSOs and frats/sororities (which also require quite competitive applications but that’s another can of worms) but tightly restricted within those social circles, so make sure you are leveraging these networks.

edit: this post exists to reflect on my experiences and offer a word of advice to younger students. yes, this was my dream school, but because of that I came in with rose tinted glass thinking that as long as I do well (get into a good major, get good grades, get into good clubs) I will be recognized by the real world and be rewarded with a good job. However, I was unaware of the fact that networking is such an important factor in addition to doing well academically, and sometimes even trumps academic achievement. For those that have had similar experiences, I feel seen and I am glad we can all recognize the bigger issue. Yet I want to make it clear that I am not looking for sympathy, but to offer perspectives that I wish someone would have told me coming into college. I write this post partially to also let younger students know that academic achievement isn’t all and it’s better to start building connections, especially if they didn’t realize that network is important or what networking even is (as I was when I started college). 

Secondly, I admit that yes, I perhaps could’ve done better and shot for the stars. I am not giving myself any excuses, as many in the comments think I am doing. This isn’t a pity party, and I am not blaming other hardworking people for “taking things away from me”. My criticism is on the system where some people who have low, no experience, etc, can get a job because their parents have connection.

Lastly, some comments seem to rely on confirmation bias when evaluating the information in this post. More dangerously, making assumptions in the name of “tough love”. Just because I shed light on some less-than-peachy aspects of uw does not mean I have no connections or relationships. I have a job, friends, and I am full of hope. I am simply recognizing the fact that to get here, it took me a lot of extra work.",Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/13slm07/reflection_from_a_jaded_senior_gatekeeping/,36,269,top

730,epu304,Daily Review: Mediterranean Bowl at Center Fable 43.8dB,"Dear HFS,

Sorry for my absence in feedback. I tried to return the day before yesterday, and have attached the previous texts below.

Today I was euphoric when I saw the beef chili on the menu, kind of Norman victory of 1066 happy. The beef chili is quite possibly the best HFS meal I've had this week. In fact it was out of stock, the best HFS meal I've had this week was in my dreams: my humble feedback would to please give me decent food so that the best meal I've had from you is not in fact fictitious.

Instead I resorted to the Mediterranean Bowl: one of my favourites. I choose to add the beef, I'm not an ethical man. The beef was good, the bowl had a lot of food which was warm: more than I normally get both in heat and quality. I reiterate my previous points: it's way too expensive.

Also what's up with the lack of lids on catering troughs. You know, the trays food is kept in the weird warm fridges, that have cling film on. Why the flip, don't they have lids? Would lids not be more economical, environmental, and utilitarianism. Or is this some kind of aesthetic that's been lost on me? Is there actually a HFS Shitsthetic that I'm too uncultured to get?

747,pitysl,Advice to my younger freshman self...,"...from future you, who's been on campus for less than 2 quarters

1. Please read up what panic attacks and anxiety looks like. Cause when you took only half an edible and freaked out, you could've saved money by not going to the hospital. General rule of thumb, don't do anything new drug wise by yourself 

2. I don't care how cute it was when your first date with that junior was watching ATLA, trust him when he says he doesn't want a relationship. You're only hurting by staying and he is definitely not changing for you lol

3. Make multiple friend groups. Not just that group of people on your floor who gush about Superbad. Because trust me if (actually when) that group falls apart you're going to feel like the whole world is ending. Make friends everywhere and you're going to be just fine

4. That best friend 3,000 miles away from you? Not worth staying in your room convincing her to video call when friends at your door are holding snacks and ice cream because they wanted to support you during that friend breakup. Sometimes you outgrow people from your past and that's ok. It just means you're getting closer to being the person you're meant to be 

5. Don't walk alone at night on the Ave and Greek Row. If that boy cared about you, he would've cared about your safety

6. Flick the bean in the morning. Don't care how horny you are because 2 seconds away from finishing you're going to accidently make eye contact with your roommate who also thought you were sleeping...

7. 4am at ode with friends and strangers is going to make you happier than that one frat party 

8. Stop taking school so serious and get out of your room. Trust yourself that the after class revision was enough 

9. Water and center table's scrambled eggs the next morning. Your keys are in the fridge btw

10. Ice in that drink! Don't grind on the guy dressed up as harry potter! Go with three friends if you anticipate going home with some other girl!

10. Actually no take your studies seriously. After that first midterm, midterm season doesn't stop until 2 weeks before the end of quarter. Get back on that smh

11. Just know no matter what you did your best. You aren't perfect and no one is. Even that girl who seems to have everything (4.0 in CSE, a bf, perfect outfits, perfect body, etc.) Focus on doing YOUR best.

12. Stop taking everything so goddamn personal. You aren't the moon kissing the night sky. You have to sing Under the Sea with all your heart. You have to shovel Cheerios 2 mins before your 8:30 because you know you aren't going to function later. You have to pause for a minute and just admire those corgis. You have to stop spending hours after a test figuring out your grade and then your back up major. You've got to stop trying to make your neighbors like you. Fuck it kid. You've got to love yourself.

13. I'm proud of you even if mom doesn't tell you. Your value doesnt go down when she yells at you for not carrying your tracker (sorry I mean cellular device) everywhere. You aren't a whore

14. That guy from madrona? That girl from calc? Those people you randomly met? I can't wait for you to get to know them because you're going to find so much love. Open your heart to then and watch how you heal in a healthy environment. You deserve this

""2:30,"" I replied. So I went to my Marine Bio class at 9:30 then used the time after to study for the Bio exam. In my mind, I still thought it was 2:30... But at exactly 1:35, I checked my phone to see my calendar for the quarter, which was the lock screen... and then... my heart dropped. My exam was at 1:30. I thought I might as well drop and take it again next quarter. But then I didn't give up... I grabbed my wallet, keys, and backpack and DASHED towards the door, PRESSED the elevator button... and waited like Thanos. I got in there, PRESSED floor 3, got out, RAN out the door, RAN through the Quad and then stopped to walk because I'm not athletic, then RAN again. Got to the front, my TA and John Parks directed me towards the back and proceeded to hand me the Exam... I wrote like a MAD MAN, like I'd never written before, wrote like Stephen King if he took Adderall. I will never forget this experience. Now I know what people are saying about PTSD after college for being late to exams. But one thing Dawgs... in the words of JOHN CENA... NEVER GIVE UP!

785,si6lsl,District Market out of Red Bulls,"I started college a devoted connoisseur of tea. A caffeine boost for me meant going crazy with some Earl Grey instead of my usual green tea. But soon the stress of weed-out classes and part time work at a fast food restaurant piled on to me. Simply put, I was exhausted. Around early November I was finally lured across the border into coffee consumption like a waterfront seagull is baited by an Ivar's french fry. This was my gateway drug. What started as one cup before my Math 125 lecture soon became three per day. Then four. Then five. As I integrated my way into finals season, I once again found myself drudging my way through the day in a cloudy stupor of apathy and mental exhaustion. I needed something new. 

With over $500 still left on my dining account, I stumbled into the District Market one Saturday morning looking for something absurd to buy in bulk. I considered potatoes and condoms, but soon realized both would sit around unused on the floor of my dorm, a stark reminder of my shortcomings this quarter. But then I saw them. Shiny metal cylinders, glistening erotically under the florescent lighting of the DM - their red, white and blue logo filling me with a patriotic romanticism I hadn't felt since Jay Inslee secured his third term as governor. I needed them. I needed them all.

Frantically filling a basket with as many as I could carry, I paraded my Red Bull bounty to the cashier with a new-found optimism. I was going to make it through the quarter.

As finals came and went, I jittered and twitched through my days with ease. While occasionally the DM would run out of my fix, I had a large enough stockpile under my bed to give me an illusion of sustainability. Simply put, I thought I was invincible. And I got complacent. Over the last few weeks, I decided to dip into my surplus, put off a restock until after midterms. Two days ago I found myself with only 10 Bulls to my name. I quickly marched over to the District Market for a resupply mission. Upon entering, my stomach folded itself into a klein bottle. The entire shelf was empty. 

In desperation, I returned yesterday. Nothing. And again this morning. Nothing. I sit here now sipping my very last Red Bull and typing this short rant out of desperation. But also as a warning to my fellow Huskies. Please help.",Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/si6lsl/district_market_out_of_red_bulls/,24,252,top

""Even though we don't believe we saw the candidates at their best, “lazy” and “unprepared” should not have been used to describe them.""

These endorsements were grounded in general opinions and attitudes. 

Is this really worth our time to gripe about, this circle jerk of apologies? Slippery slope my boundless boys.

813,nb29b8,Get Ben Wiggins a Permanent Position at the Dept. of Biology,"Hi Guys,

I'm a graduating senior here at the UW graduating from Biochemistry. Some of you may know or have taken intro biology from Ben Wiggins. If you have you have seen how amazing this man is at teaching and the positive impact he leaves on freshmen every year. This quarter is unfortunately his last quarter. It has come to my attention that Ben is not a professor here and is hired as ""staff that teaches"". This means Ben works as administrative staff and only fills teaching positions when there are not enough people to teach. Unfortunately the Bio department does not plan to give him a full professor position to him and therefore he is not guaranteed for any new instructing opportunities. He has told me that this quarter is his last quarter teaching. Ben is the only instructor I have had the pleasure of learning from who actively incorporates the issues of equity in life, science, and stem into his lectures. He makes everyone feel welcome and he inspires students to become scientists.

 I am asking that if you find you care about this, that you please send a letter to the chair of biology and the associate chair of biology letting them know of your feelings. Additionally, you can make an impact by just giving him the rate my professor you've been meaning to but forgot about. STEM needs work to be better for it's students and accessible to everyone and if we lose Ben we will be losing one of our best workers here at UW.

Emails are: Chair of Biology David Perkel: [perkel@uw.edu](mailto:perkel@uw.edu)

Associate Chair of Undergraduate Biology Jennifer Ruesink: [ruesink@uw.edu](mailto:ruesink@uw.edu)

Edit: Ben himself told me this information and when I asked how to help this is what he told me. He may be teaching this summer I'm not sure perhaps he meant this is his last year. Yes he is in administration like I said, staff that teaches. However, he will be leaving teaching and looking elsewhere because there are no open positions. The point is that Ben would teach as his sole job if he could be he is not being given that position.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/nb29b8/get_ben_wiggins_a_permanent_position_at_the_dept/,16,249,top

1. Will I get accepted?
2. What are my chances of getting accepted?
3. Will my offer get rescinded?
4. Is (some area around UW) safe?

The answers are the same most of the time, and it seems like people don’t look at previously asked questions before posting. I know it’s kind of a petty complaint, but it’s annoying as hell! I feel like this sub would benefit from posts with those questions not being allowed outside a specific megathread. That way people are also forced to see other peoples questions and the answers they’ve gotten and might not even need to post their question after all. 

Anyway, if that doesn’t happen and you have one of the questions above, here are the formal answers 

1. Maybe!
2. The acceptance rate of the school!
3. Probably not! Unless you murdered someone or didn’t actually graduate highschool or something, and if that’s the case, you have a bigger problem on your hands!
4. Nowhere in Seattle is safe because I am here and I will track you down and steal all your electronics so there’s one less person asking these questions!

834,178jkym,A suggestion to people considering UW (and any other schools with a city campus),"Do not be surprised when the city is a city!!!

The vast majority of safety-related posts on this sub boil down to “why is the city like a city, don’t they know STUDENTS live here?” or “how can I go to school in the city without confronting anything that is different from suburbia?” and I have to say, it’s really goofy. I understand that safety is important, but next to none of the questions asked need to be answered with any more nuance than “carry mace and be aware of your surroundings.” I’m not saying you can’t feel unsafe, but college is all about growing up and learning about the world, which often includes encountering things that aren’t comfortable or familiar, and posting asking if you’re gonna get murdered on the ave past 8pm or something like that is not going to help you in the long run. There are countless schools in small cozy college towns that are equally, if not more, academically rigorous than UW. With all those options out there, going to a school in the city is very much a choice, and it’s important to recognize a major city is a major city. You’ll be hard pressed to find one in the United States that doesn’t have the qualities that make people feel unsafe.

I know some people always have beef with this sort of take, but regardless on your opinion of how a city should be governed/policed/whatever, the current state of our city and all other major cities in the United States is reality. Carry your mace, keep an eye on your surroundings, and if you’re someone more vulnerable for whatever reason, try and have a buddy with you if you’re out late at night. If you want to challenge yourself, maybe even make eye contact with a homeless person and give them a nod instead of pretending they don’t exist; contrary to popular belief, most of them will not cannibalize you on the spot if you do so!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/178jkym/a_suggestion_to_people_considering_uw_and_any/,27,246,top
835,qkwas4,PSA: You should know what violates FERPA rules,"I recently took a midterm where they required us to write our name and student ID number on every page. ""Ok, if something gets separated, this makes sense as there will be no question about whose paper it is,"" I was thinking as I was starting my midterm.   
When we get them back a few days later, our exams were ripped into multiple sections and **left out in piles for the entire class to go through.** The next section walked in after our class and started going through the piles, too. **Our names in conjunction with our grades and student ID numbers (both of which are by definition educational records and therefore protected) were out and available for anyone to see.**   


You guys, ***this is a blatant violation of FERPA****.* Our grades are personal educational records. If I choose to flip through an exam with all my grades on it in view of everyone, that's my choice. If I want to keep my grades hidden and only look at them in a locked, windowless closet, that's my choice too. Having grades in a pile with identifiable information attached to them *takes away this right that we have as students*.   


[Here](http://courses.washington.edu/registr/FERPA_Faculty_Staff/FERPA_Handout.pdf) is a PDF that outlines some of this. It was written in 2011 but have FERPA requirements loosened since then? No. They haven't. 

[This link](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/ferpa/) says that ""**Public posting** of grades either by the student’s name, student number, or social security number without the student’s written permission is a violation of FERPA.""

WSU has a statement in [this link](http://ferpa.em.wsu.edu/faqs/) that directly states that handing back graded work like this is a violation. (Under Staff and 'How should I return graded work?' there is a statement that says, ""Distributing graded work in a way that exposes the student’s identity or leaving personally identifiable graded papers unattended is no different from posting grade publicly."")

  
**IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED IN ONE OF YOUR CLASSES:**   
Please follow [this link](https://privacy.uw.edu/report/), and report it! We have rights as students, and being able to call out our university for violating FERPA is one of them. We also have a right to report UW *directly to the Department of Education.* [This](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=478-140-080) shows that right, as well as [this one](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/). 

[This page](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/) (same link as the immediate last one) has a FERPA training for students (it's a 10 minute video and a short quiz) if you want more information.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/qkwas4/psa_you_should_know_what_violates_ferpa_rules/,60,247,top

873,e6ske8,Daily Review: BBQ Beef Marinara 80.3dB,"Dear HFS,

How've you been?

I got the pasta special, I wouldn't describe it as special nor pasta. I can only assume you'd intended to make a Bolognese, accidentally snorted an entire jar of paprika: and found nowhere else to spew.

For $7.49 instead of buying overcooked pasta with a sauce that could only be described as disappointing even if I had got it from a discount dented tin can, I could have walked to Dominos. Got a pizza, and have enough change to buy an overpriced bowl of cereal tomorrow morning after undoubtedly having a horrid case of the shits.

I could have got the potato curry again. However I decided to take one for the team, and provide a variety in my feedback for y'all. I would love it if I was able to provide a quality range of feedback by eating cheap decent meals, like the tolerable potato curry yesterday.

For reference a medium sized truck makes 80.3dB. After finishing my meal I said ""HFS is a scam"" at 80.3db.

Love you lots,

Keep up the scam,

Along with around 15 other engineers and designers, I decided to tackle this issue of antisocial-academia this summer. After months of grinding, I’m proud to announce that our work has finally resulted in some pay-off (lol).

Today, I’m excited to introduce KiwiLink - the ultimate UW study buddy finder app! Download it for free on iOS and Android today. 

KiwiLink is super easy to use. Create an account, select your classes and majors, and BOOM! Our special algorithm will automatically introduce you to relevant study buddies in the “For You” page. Swipe right to add these people as KiwiLink friends, and then you can chat with them and make study groups with them! And who knows… Perhaps you’ll find a special someone who’s MORE than just a study buddy xd

But yuh. If you want to find some new UW friends to study with or chat with (or more), download KiwiLink today! It’s free and it’s available on both iOS and Android. We’ve been tirelessly working on this project for a couple of months, so we really hope that people make good use of our app.

899,h8kza0,To everyone who was skipped at graduation,"I'm so fucking proud of you!!!!!!!

Despite covid, despite online classes, despite social ills impacting us right now, you've made a remarkable accomplishment despite 4 years of anxieties, frustrations, and challenges.

However you've also had 4 years of hopefully good memories, laughs, and accomplishments. Nothing will ever change the fact that you've accomplished so much!

To those who were omitted and feel alone...

You're not alone. I was the only person from my former high school (16 of us were graduating) who was mentioned at graduation this year, and even then, not where I was supposed to be. 

I was College of Arts and Sciences. For some reason, I was put with the random stragglers after the College of Social Work. I know that an online graduation is tough, but the 6 minutes where I felt embarrassed and angry that my name wasn't mentioned, at least when I still thought I was omitted? I can only imagine how everyone else feels, who weren't even misplaced as much as they were omitted. 

If we're still being told to have a weak cop out by joining the C/O '21, I'd hope that the Office of Ceremonies/UW at least try to do something to compensate. For many of us, this was one of the most important events of our lives thus far, and for others, a moment of pride. Through UW's and their contractor's gross incompetence, many people have felt hurt in times already tough.

To any graduates now, who were missed, I see you, and I'm so proud of you all for your achievements. Please, take your objective accomplishment, and continue to work for yourself and in making this world a better place.

I'm genuinely so proud of you all, and whilst employment, and life in general are far from ideal right now, tough times breed tough people, and tough people breed good times. As the cycle of life continues, know that as we continue, in our individual and societal pursuits, that we can and will build a future regardless of this one day, and this one year.

Congratulations to the Class of 2020! I wish you all the best.

P.S. In the event that the Office of Ceremonies/UW does nothing to compensate and celebrate those missed, is there something that we as students, and now alumni, can do to make things feel better?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/h8kza0/to_everyone_who_was_skipped_at_graduation/,8,239,top

**Why, my career is ended.**

&#x200B;

Who, you, never! Gaston, youve got to pull yourself together!

&#x200B;

Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston,

Being in so much distress

Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston

Even in ACMS!

There's no reject in town as admired as you,

Your major is just as valid,

Everyone's awed and inspired by you,

And you don't need to be in Allen....

&#x200B;

No one codes like Gaston,

Sits in Ode like Gaston,

No one's code incredibly borrowed as Gaston

For theres no BO in town this egregious

Perfect, a pure paragon

You can ask any Brett, Paul, or Reges,

and they'll tell you whose GitHub they'd want to be on!

No one's style like Gaston,

Goes the mile like Gaston,

And on LinkedIn no ones profiles like Gaston,

**I'm especially good at making connections!** (Howdy!)

Job offers for Gaston!

No one Bytes like Gaston,

Java writes like Gaston,

In a Critters match nobody fights like Gaston

You guys are amazing for keeping your composure. I'm a UWT student in the IT major and I hope to have you guys again.



Professor Goda, the head of the major, caught a cheater during our jeopardy quiz. The mood completely changed from there on but he still was willing to give the class extra credit for the top 5 groups. You genuinely made waking up at 8:45 enjoyable. You interacted with your class like it was a late night discord call with the homies. I don't think I've laughed this much in class ever. (It was also adorable that your wife would come talk to you during our breaks)

Professor Costarella (Chuck), I fully want to email you my final project. I'm willing to finish this. Time management sucked this quarter since MW classes were screwed out of 3 sessions this quarter.

947,grpg1t,Korean restaurant ranking in U-district from poor Korean international student,"&#x200B;

Why Korean food so expensive around U district? 

Here's ranking

3: Korean Tofu House

\- This place is alright, recently remodeled. but sometimes they piss me off that they're kind of half-assing the banchan(side dishes) and sometimes cooks seem like they never had Korean food before. It's on and off on some days. Very Americanized Korean food though and ramen for 8 dollars? go to h mart across the street and buy yourself 10 ramens. 

2: Cafe on the ave

\- Known as a cafe but surprisingly good Korean food. Affordable and a lot of food.

1: The Alley

\- If you don't know what 'ajumma' hospitality is. You'll learn if you go to this place. I think this place is the closest thing to restaurant-grade food in Korea. 

&#x200B;

Honorable mentions:

Green House

That nightclub (buffet is not bad)

Ninja sushi queen backflip 360 quick scope

&#x200B;

Places that are way overpriced because they're selling the 'experience'(almost Portage bay of Korean food) imo:

Most university subreddits don’t allow posts like this, and instead make megathreads for admissions questions for obvious reasons. There’s also other subreddits like r/chanceme that are completely devoted to these kinds of questions.

I completely understand just wanting to feel a little certainty, and I remember how anxious waiting for a decision can be. But the truth is that none of us are able to read your GPA and SAT off a reddit post and then accurately tell you whether you’ll be admitted or not. The admissions criteria is holistic and often pretty unclear, and even if you think you have no shot, it can’t hurt to apply and see.

977,qyh9sm,PSA for those living in campus housing,"Last year I was living in the dorms in Lander, I had stayed here for both thanksgiving and Christmas because of covid. On Christmas Day last year, while I was in my room just on my phone being quiet whatever assumed vacant, got my doorknob rattled on and someone trying to get into my room. My friend and I were obviously pissing our pants at this points, I live in a single, and we weren’t going to confront this person head on but I did go to the door and look at the peephole. I saw a person turned back to me at the door across doing the same thing and did it to numerous other doors, I immediately called uwpd but the person was gone already by the time they got there. I lived on 4th floor at the time and my friend who lived on 7th returned to their room to check if everything was okay to see their door wide open, nothing was taken because there was no cash or anything, there was even a really expensive gaming laptop of the friends roommate in there untouched so I don’t think people will necessarily take items as much as they are looking for cash, doesn’t mean someone won’t though. So, if you are leaving for the holidays either thanksgiving or Christmas, be very aware and lock your door every time you are in and out of your room, excellent to practice in general, I know the doors lock on their own when you shut them. But my guess is the person had a card or something to wedge in between the door to open it, if your door is locked you have nothing to worry about.

996,13l70r8,Open Letter To Boba Up Employees,"I saw a poster on Tuesday morning saying that BobaUp employers were stealing employee tips. This poster has since been taken down and the original poster didn't have anything on it about how to get in contact with people or if there was any organizing to combat this practice. I just wanted to let those employees know that under Washington State Law:

* Employers must pay all tips to employees.
* The employer may not take tips for company use, or to pay employee wages.
* “Tip crediting” isn’t allowed. Tips are **in addition to**, and not a part of, an employee’s state hourly minimum wage.

[https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges](https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges)

I know a lot of workers especially in the service industry worry that it is a losing battle when it comes to standing up for their labor violations, so I wanted to link some resources to ways that employees can enforce their rights:

1. You can get free legal council about your situation with the king county bar association. This will probably be low on the priority list, but they will get to you and it is FREE. I did this myself about a workplace violation and while I have to hire an attorney for the actual lawsuit, it is good to have free legal council to see if proceeding with legal action is a good idea (link to free legal assistance [https://www.kcba.org/?pg=Free-Legal-Assistance](https://www.kcba.org/?pg=Free-Legal-Assistance) )
2. Make sure to document as much as you can in writing. When you have a spoken conversation with your employer saying this stuff about your wages, email them a followup confirming what had been discussed in the meeting so you have a paper trail. Often recording this is enough to scare them straight
3. Talk to your coworkers about your situation and see if you can form a united front. Employers talk a lot about how your labor is replaceable, but honestly it is costly to fire a bunch of people legally, let alone illegally, and then hire a bunch of new inexperienced people. There are ways that you can organize in order to collectively bargain for good treatment. Just because a company is a small business that does not mean that you should accept unethical and illegal treatment from your employer.",PSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/13l70r8/open_letter_to_boba_up_employees/,23,227,top

The HFS website even says they close at 9 PM. I arrive at 7:40 PM. I *should* have plenty of time. I walk in. The gate around Lander Desk is closed. But the desk is still fully staffed with 4-5 people working about. I ask them if they can help me. They say ""No, they are closing at 7 PM for this week.""

I call the RA on call. They say that they can't help me because they can't verify my identity, but I should be able to go to Lander Desk. I tell them the desk is closed.

17,lk6grz,The truth is? Nobody cares anymore.,"Not just Greek Row. As a ""primary source"", someone living in the dorms, I can tell you that the people living in the dorms and hanging out around campus don't care either. No social distancing at all, a bunch of friends playing in the snow together or inviting each other over into dorms for little kickbacks, etc.

Greek Row gets scapegoated once again while not a **single** soul on the Ave, Campus, U-District, etc. follows guidelines. Is Greek Row wrong? Yes. But if you want a petition to suspend them, you better suspend the dorm students as well. In other words, suspend everyone who came out to live on/near campus this year.

It's extremely naive to think they are the only ones in the entire city of Seattle ""ruining it for us"" hahaha, HFS ain't even truly regulating shit to be completely honest. I remember when we had a fire drill and we all huddled up together on the field. Some employee said ""hey, social distancing"" and nobody listened and remained huddled up. Like, hundreds of people.

It is what it is. You guys who are completely remote (most of the people on this reddit) just have no idea what's really going on. The problem is everyone, me included. Shit really got worse in regards to social distancing after the constant stream of great vaccine news, I'll tell you that much.

Go ahead and downvote this post, but I'm just telling it like it is: they aren't the only ones and honestly haven't been since like September. The entire United States fucked this one up, and so we just wait until we're vaccinated by summer and carry on with our lives. If Fall is online again, it wasn't because of Greek Row. It was due to poor vaccine distribution. But, Biden is making good progress and daily vaccinations passed the million mark, so there's that. Cheers.

Edit: If you wanted to complain about Greek Row in the summer, that makes sense. Vaccine was far off and the situation was ""in control"" up until that point around early July. But now? Give me break. We're averaging 1000+ cases a day (7-day average) without their help. This shit is all fucked.


Edit 2: No I’m not gonna go around taking pictures of the dorm people or people around campus and report back to this subreddit. I’m not fucking weird. Remember that deleted post from the summer where one of you weirdos took a picture of some Greek people chilling on their front lawn with their live-in mates and complained despite the fact that that was their family unit?

33,3svoj7,How can the Black Lives Matter movement gain YOUR support on campus?,"As this is a college subreddit, I was wondering why you do or don't support Black Lives Matter.

One of the main issues I see with this movement is that it has horrible leadership. Perhaps it is an issue with media coverage but it always seems that some idiot gets everyone fired up in the wrong way (i.e. getting up in Bernie Sanders face, blocking highways, or most recently blocking 45th).

Also, they seem to pick the wrong people to use as symbolism for their movement. Mike Brown was the go-to representative death to use for the BLM protests, but he was a violent thief that charged a cop. Why not choose Eric Garner or Ervin Edwards?

Also this mob thinking that all white people are the same and that colored people cannot be prejudiced. Some of the most hateful, racist comments I have ever heard uttered have been from black people (but most recently the internationals who come here who rant about EACH OTHER! Chinese vs japanese, koreans vs japanese etc). That's just my anecdotal evidence, not saying all are like that, but that's what I have been exposed to.

This video in particular, during which they silence a young asian woman speaking out against group-think and taking a very MLK like stance really grinds my gears: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8UTj8lQJhY

We have to face the facts: black people are disproportionately targetted by police, were the original targets of drug war campaigns, are underepresented due to their low economic class, underepresented further by the high rate of felony incarceration which leaves them unable to vote for life, and of course daily misjudgement and treatment by other races who fear/loathe them because of persistant blind bigotry, and the gangs and high crime rates the black race is associated with here in America.

However, as one commenter said below, the BLM crowd tends to focus on these outside forces and never on internals. The black populace needs to be equipped with the institutional tools and financial support to rid their communities of black on black violence, reinforce the role of fathers, drive the gangs and violent criminals out, and educate their children so that they don't fall into the poverty trap that is the current state of black society.

These are blatant faults that are not the MAJORITY of the reason their society remains beaten down after so many years of ""equal opportunity"" laws, but should be acknowledged by the BLM crowd as further evidence that the black community needs attention. Replacing the constant ""check your privilege"" jabs and anti-white brigades with this acknowledgement won't piss off the people who are in position to help you and will gain the support of other minorities who face many of the same issues.

So what do you think? They have a valid cause, but how do we advance it?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/3svoj7/how_can_the_black_lives_matter_movement_gain_your/,23,0,controversial

44,s1r1lj,Still Mad about CSE 143E Still Having No Resubmissions,"Really am struggling to get over this. In a recent Q&A session, Hunter Schafer addressed the absence of resubmissions for this quarter of CSE 143. He explained the reason for the absence was ""a Staffing Issue"".

There is no doubt resubmissions have a significant impact on your grade. This was one of the only ways I was able to learn in 142; in these times of pandemic there already isn't much teacher-to-student contact and communication. I used feedback from my TA's as a place to get personal help and explanations on what I was doing right or wrong and then have the opportunity to resubmit with my new knowledge. Now we are in a new offering of 143 that has even less teacher to student contact, due to the lectures being videos from other quarters, and there still is no resubmissions

So now my grade might suffer drastically due to a ""staffing issue"".

Not saying the CS department is to blame for this. Sounds like there truly is a shortage of TAs this quarter. Not sure what the solution is, but what's frustrating is there are staffing issues plaguing UW in all areas yet we are still getting charged the full price to go here.  \~60k for me to not receive what is promised from this education. For example, we are forced to have a dining plan if on campus but the dining options are super inaccessible due to ""staffing issues"". Well if you didn't require it then there would be less strain on the dining system and in turn higher accessibility. Of course, this won't happen because UW has proven time and time again it loves money.

I understand they don't have enough TA's for resubmissions, I just think they should do something grading-wise to account for this change, something that would still give me a chance in competing with students who took 143 in a quarter that had resubmissions.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/s1r1lj/still_mad_about_cse_143e_still_having_no/,15,0,controversial

101,mn1qr4,What can you do with a humanities degree? Part 2,"What can you do with a humanities degree? We've asked graduates from across the Humanities Division to write about what their current jobs are like, and how their educations helped prepare them for the challenges and responsibilities of their current work.

Right now, we're spotlighting Maureen Trantham, who discusses how her humanities education has helped her to become Senior Vice President of Operations, Social Impact and Philanthropy at Sesame Workshop (yes, the people who make Sesame Street)!

Maureen majored in Comparative History of Ideas (CHID) and Journalism. She writes, “At the UW, my CHID and Journalism professors not only encouraged me to engage in my own independent research and inquiry through the Mary Gates Undergraduate Research Scholarship, but also apply my learnings and develop practical skills via internships like the Journalism Foreign Intrigue Program. This blend of theory and practice taught me to be flexible, creative, pragmatic and solution-oriented. It also strengthened my ability to pull from multiple disciplines to deconstruct a problem – whether I am advising executives, analyzing the merits of different strategies or developing implementation plans. This laid the foundation for my work in journalism, education policy and advocacy, management consulting and now operations at Sesame.”

• Masks work to prevent spread to those around you and they don’t work if you have your nose out. 

All in all, remember to distance and mask up. These preventative measures protect no only yourself, but everyone else and that’s exactly why we have to keep doing them.

 My question to the people who roam this subreddit, should I tell the professor that this person is working in a group on this specific test? 

Some details:
1. Class is not curved
2. Not a lot of people taking this test so it's easy to distinguish who is cheating
3. I don't even know his name or his major, so this isn't personal
4. I know a friend who is friends with this person, so it's possible to figure how his identity
5. He will be taking 3 different tests, which I am fairly certain that he will be working in a group for all of them. Therefore, giving him an advantage
6. I have studied for this test, so it's not a sense of jealously (I think)

148,26tln0,Why is the UW screwing over students so hard in tuition?," Why is the tuition a whopping $12.5k a year when the UW is sitting on an endowment bank of 2.3 billion dollars up 235 million on last year? If they took the 235 million dollar increase from last year and put it towards lowering the tuition of the 29 thousand undergraduate students they would  have lowered it by over $8k meaning it would instead cost us only $4.5k. They would still have their 2.1 billion dollar bank that they had last year.

And to make matters worse despite the overpriced tuition and large endowment the university still won't get its act together regarding the abysmal acceptance rates of its engineering schools and other programs. Computer science and engineering has dropped below a 28% acceptance rate and other programs are having similar funding issues.

What the fuck is going on and why the fuck are we getting screwed over so hard? What happened to this being a public university? I don't know how they expect students like me to be able to afford $27k a year costs. The only reason I'm able to keep attending is because summer software internships pay well and I work 40 hours each week while going part-time(which doesn't save much on tuition...).

150,5pg06u,Response to UW Presidential Statement Regarding Shooting,"If you're a UW student, you should've gotten President Ana Mari's email about our non-acceptance to violence.

A few months ago, a Muslim girl was attacked on campus. We asked that an email be sent out at the time, so that the UW community would not make light of crimes against Muslims or put anyone's safety in jeopardy.The perpetrator was on the loose, we wanted to know who he was.

CAIR set up a press conference on Red Square, and yet the UW did not release any statement on the assault. CAIR even put up a reward for any information on the attacker.. and still a silence from the university.

I am asking you to respond to Ana Mari's email informing her about your concern for violence using the template below and how silence about it may mean it will reoccur. A strict stance against it means speaking about it every time it happens and finding every subscriber to it.

Fill in the spaces regarding your affiliation the UW, and your name at the end. Copy/paste into a reply email to the President's earlier statement (and share with your friends).

Dear President Ana Mari,

I am writing to you today not only out of gratitude for your acknowledgment of the incidents which transpired last night, as well as your reaffirment of our University’s intent to serve as a violence-free zone, but also out of disappointment over the lack of similar concern over a violent act which occurred on-campus the afternoon of November 15th, 2016.

The messages you espoused regarding the election results on November 9th were hopeful and inspiring. As a ___________ (student, faculty member, worker, researcher, alumni, etc.) of the University of Washington, I was proud to uphold “...our responsibility to serve the public good...” which would “never waver” and to be working “...to reaffirm our ongoing and unwavering support toward creating and nurturing an inclusive, diverse and welcoming community.”

However, that right and gratitude was tarnished shortly after the receival of such uplifting messages, when I heard no word from my University’s President concerning the violent physical assault of a female Muslim student on-campus. This silence spoke volumes. Instead of apologizing on behalf of the University for the struggles she faced on its grounds, and educating the rest of the community body on the crime’s specifics to promote help in finding the perpetrator, and providing information for everybody’s safety, I can only assume an e-mail sent on November 17th was intended to encompass this incident along with others by stating, “[t]here have...been several reports of harassment, vandalism and violent incidents, in our state and even on our own campuses. We want to be clear: assault, discrimination, harassment, or vandalism have no place on our campuses.”

Although such statements were necessary to make, they were not sufficient. The nature of this crime was such that the outrage for this crime, seeking justice for this crime, and intolerance for any such crime - then, now, and in the future - should stand alone, and not be inferred as being a part of a broader statement. This was an assault, this was discrimination, and this must be prevented in the future in keeping with the vision for this University that you have shared of a nurturing, inclusive, and welcoming community.

My concern is the safety of everyone on campus, as is yours. I hope to see action from the University of Washington administration that reflects a consciousness for every student regardless of their background, way of life, or faith. The concern should be vocal, prominent, and transparent.

I thank you in advance for your willingness to speak up on behalf of all of us, especially the purposely marginalized.

167,cxr7mj,CS Direct Admit first quarter schedule/other general advice,"Hey guys,

I'm an incoming freshman DA and I am worried about the schedule I am registered for currently; I tried reaching out to a cs advisor but they haven't gotten back to me yet. I'd really appreciate any advice you have for me.

The classes I'm registered for now are CSE 311, 351, and 391, with a 7 credit Landscape Architecture FIG. The total credit amount is 16, but it will be 18 after adding the DA Seminar class. I'm concerned that this schedule would be very time-consuming. I know a lot of students take two CSE classes a quarter but 17 credits are quite intimidating. I was hoping to take a lighter course load for this fall quarter in order to get used to UW and the dorms, make new friends and have fun, focus on trying to get an internship, etc. What do you guys think? 

I am leaning towards dropping 351 and 391 and adding an easier general education class, but I wanted to know if I'd be alright for the future and not too overwhelmed with CSE classes. For reference, I am bringing in 105 total credits from running start/AP and would like to graduate in three years. I need 23 more credits of general education, need to take Phys 122 and Math 308, and then the rest are CSE classes. I want to balance how many CSE courses I take so that I don't take too many or too little in the 3rd year. I want to fill out the rest of my classes with electives in business, statistics, economics, communications, etc. to help me in the industry. I am unsure of double majoring/minoring. 

Finally, I want to get a new laptop for school and was interested in the difference between MacBooks and Windows laptops for CSE. Would MacBooks be easier? I heard they might because they are Unix machines but I have no knowledge about that. Do most students prefer one over another? I would love to buy a MacBook pro but they are very expensive, even with the student discount right now. Would a premium laptop be helpful with the nice computer labs in the CS buildings?

Do you guys have any other general advice for new computer science students?

Thanks

I believe everyone has a right to protest when it comes to racial inequality but you’re literally gonna go to a library where the rules are to be quiet so people can study and then get mad and  immediately blurt racial slurs just because someone politely asked you to be quiet?

191,ao2q4u,We don't have all the information about the recent tragedy! Stop witch hunting!,"I think it's important to remember that in the face of tragedy it's easy to leap to conclusions. While the recent death on campus is a truly horrible event, we simply don't know enough to make a judgement on the role of the administration in the recent death.

&#x200B;

All the evidence we have that the administration could have prevented the tragedy is a haphazard collection of anecdotes. Sure, people are posting here that they slipped and fell and that they saw substandard work being done to de-ice walkways, but is that really enough to make an empirical judgement on the safety of campus? A bunch of random redditors and students can't judge the administration's effectiveness in dealing with the ice, instead we need an official investigation by qualified authorities. 

&#x200B;

Next, I'm not convinced that we should be expecting the university to completely de-ice campus. Is it reasonable to buy enough salt and sand to cover all of the walkways on campus, and is there enough time and money to hire the workers needed to spread it? I don't know, and neither do you. We simply aren't aware of the logistics behind a thorough campus de-icing, and before leaping to the conclusion that the administration is mishandling the situation we should consider the possibility that completely de-icing the campus (as some people on this sub seem to want) is unfeasible.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I'm sure the administration is under considerable pressure to reopen campus as soon as possible. Every day campus is closed, the university is losing a considerable amount of money. Research isn't being done, floors aren't being cleaned, books aren't being shelved, students aren't being educated. Cauce simply can't shut down  campus without extremely good reason. A death is more than enough reason to close campus, but hindsight is 20/20. Cauce chose to open campus with the knowledge that something like this may happen, because there was obviously still ice on the ground. Us experiencing such a tragedy doesn't necessarily mean the Cauce made the wrong call. 

&#x200B;

Of course, the administration could be at fault. The thing is, we don't have enough information yet to say. Stop jumping to conclusions!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ao2q4u/we_dont_have_all_the_information_about_the_recent/,3,0,controversial

And now it just turned into a scale of whole uni; I'm scared of even being here but I have to stay to graduate. 

I'm just done with everything, I'm fucking done.

But then you might say ""well if your opportunity is shit, that's what you get"". I think it's not civil when you try to put me down for having different opinion. 

I guess it started with imposter syndrome, but it turned into something bigger than I thought, and I just need a help. I'm gonna get downvotes but I just wanted to share a piece of thoughts. Some of you might say ""well that's not what everyone thinks and people I've seen so far are nice so you are wrong.""

Why does it seem like an overwhelming amount of people who post here are either computer science, math, or engineering majors?

I know computer science and engineering are popular degrees at UW, but as far as I'm aware Math isn't a very popular major relatively speaking. I'm a math major and it's rare for me to find other math majors in general ed courses.

There are a ton of people at UW who major in biology and I also know psychology is a popular degree as well. Yet I rarely ever hear anybody on this reddit say they are either one of these degrees.

Also what about the liberal arts and the social sciences? I think I've only seen maybe 2 or so people say they are a liberal arts or social science major. I've seen a little more people say they are business majors, but again not very much despite the fact that business also is a pretty popular degree at UW.

Do you think it's possible that people who don't major in STEM don't post here or don't admit to being a non-STEM major even if they post here because of potential STEM degree arrogance on the part of STEM students?

If you think that explanation is wrong what do you think is a possible explanation for this? Or do any of you disagree with my observation to begin with?

I am currently the captain of our Relay For Life team here at the University of Washington. The reason I am doing Relay this year is because the parent of one of our members within our professional business fraternity is currently battling cancer. It would be my pleasure to dedicate all proceeds of our Relay For Life fundraiser to this member and his father at the event on May 10th. The reason being is that his father was just put in hospice, and I know it would mean the world to him to know that we (our chapter and the surrounding community) care, and are there for him in his moment of crisis. Join us at the event by joining our team or donating to our pager here:

I would love to hear how I can go about getting the ""free"" stuff, from pens, papers, mouse pads, stress balls, shirts, hoodies, whatever you can get! I feel as being a college student, it should be one of the adventures of grabbing the free swag, after all, it is free, am I right?

\*

\*

After lots of research, I have found that if you want to be a UW CS major as a running start student it is most important that you get the CS major [prerequisites](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/currentuw) finished ([with nearly perfect grades](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/transfer)) so you can enroll for direct admission into the CS major as a freshman because as of 2019 the CS major became a [predominantly direct admission major](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/dtm). You should only go for an associate's degree if you have enough leftover classes after finishing the prerequisites for the CS major with high grades. An associate's degree is good for your resume and working before you get your bachelor's. I don't think most people will work at more than minimum wage jobs until after completing their major anyways, making the associate's degree seem nearly pointless for UW CS majors. After completing the prerequisites it is important to get as many [CS Major Graduation Requirements](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/ugrad/curriculum/CS_reqs_wi22.pdf) as your community college offers as possible to finish the required courses at an easier and cheaper college.

What are your thoughts? If you’ve used this restroom (or any other one like it on campus???), how was your experience?

The graffiti I am referencing reads ""End Rape"", and first showed up a few weeks ago, with more appearing just this last weekend.

Obviously if you know anyone who might have been involved in writing graffiti or has actually written this or other graffiti, you should contact the Seattle Police Department at phone number (206) 625-5011.

I understand [from this page](https://www.seattle.gov/police/contact/reporting/default.htm) that if your tip leads to an arrest or charge, you can earn up to a $1,000 reward. (Disclosure: tip leading to an arrest on graffiti will probably only get you $10-$20. HOWEVER, since this same graffiti is sprouting up everywhere, I'd imagine they would hand over something closer to $100-$150, especially since some of it is on-campus.)

You can also report graffiti to SPD using [this online report form](http://www.seattle.gov/police/prevention/graffiti.htm). It takes about 5 minutes.

250,aojiqg,I feel uneasy about this.,"So while the ice wasn't directly to blame for her death, it doesn't change the fact campus was still left with dangerous conditions. They could of done better deicing campus, as shown by the response of ice clean up directly after the death of that student. 

It doesn't change the fact that people still injured themselves on the ice the past few days. If you have limited mobility or a mobility based disability it was extremely challenging to navigate campus, unreasonably so. It doesn't change the fact that people didn't feel safe on campus. People are saying we're treating students like they're inept by advocating for less ice on campus. But not all of us are familiar with navigating ice. Not all of us can just get back up if we slip on the ice. Not all of us can pay for a trip to the doctor if we fall and get a concussion or break our nose (both of which happened to people due to the ice).

People jumped to conclusions but that doesn't change the fact that campus was still dangerous. UW didn't take proper precautions, didn't work on cleaning up the ice and then when something might of happened due to it, they finally cleaned everything up. They could of done better from the start and that's clear. 

I'm not calling for anyone's head on a plate, just I feel uneasy that the state of discussion about the ice has turned to ""it's just ice, stop being such a baby"" and people being downvoted for anything to the contrary. It's clear we tend to have a bad mob mentality, even now with our response with concern to the ice after we realized someone didn't die as a direct result of it.

It must be great to be short and just hide under your little canopy of umbrellas but god damn it's just so selfish.

271,rgbpxv,Serious question for vegans,"Are there any plants that you refuse to eat for ethical reasons?  Here, I am asking specifically about avoiding a particular plant rather than avoiding a plant because it was farmed or harvested in an unsustainable way.

The reason I ask is that, while I do eat meat, there are a number of animals that I choose to not eat for ethical reasons.  For example, pigs are quite intelligent and, for this reason, I do not eat them.   I do not have a hard a fast rule for which animals I will and will not eat.  But, the larger, older or more intelligent an animal, the less likely I am to eat it.

I understand that most of the plant food we eat does not live that long.  But, let's suppose, for example, that humans could eat oak trees.  I would definitely avoid eating oak trees because of their immense size and age.  Same goes for those beautiful cherry trees we have on campus.

So, to reiterate my question for the vegans in the room (or anybody I guess): are plants that you avoid eating, specifically because you think it is wrong to do so rather than because the plant was farmed in a unsustainable or environmentally unfriendly way?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/rgbpxv/serious_question_for_vegans/,14,1,controversial

I'm a rising junior in high school. Connecticut resident. I know going to an OOS public school isn't... smart... but I know that the University of Washington is a great school and I've always wanted to visit/live in Seattle (never been, though; I should probably do that). 

UConn's also a great school, but I don't know about the campus life. I'm not into partying or anything, but the only thing to do over there is to visit the cows they have on a farm and sporting events that I have little interest in (I'm down for hockey, though. How's that at UW?). Apparently administration is pretty uncooperative as well at UConn. 

I'm pretty sure that UConn and UW (if that's the correct abbreviation) are pretty much equal in academics. **I'm more concerned with post-graduation: co-op/research/etc. opportunities, job market, career guidance/resources, etc.**

**Prospective majors/programs — in order of interest:** 

- Chemistry 

- Pre-pharmacy (will likely major in chem during this time, and I'd hope to get both degrees)

- Engineering (big oof; Chemical Engineering or Material Science and Engineering) 

- Pre-dentistry (would also major in chem and hope to get degree in both)

- Undeclared if I can't figure it out by then. 

Also, how similar to NYC is Seattle? I'm not too fond of the former, but Seattle seems like it's own thing. 

Back to hockey: what team do you guys like over there? You don't have a team, so I guess I'm free to continue rooting for the Rangers. Big criterion in my college search.

Use your fucking brains for one fucking second: do you really fucking think every time there is a fucking spike (which will happen for the next 2-5 years), the entire world will shut down and we have to fucking go back on Zoom and wait until its “normal” again and then it spikes again and then we go back online and then we go back to in-person but wait nope it spiked back online, etc. etc. for fucking ever? **Or do we fucking accept that this shit is here and fucking LIVE WITH IT.**

Guys, please laugh with me for a second 😂 Can you fucking imagine the packed dorms (McMahon included) being sent home because of a resurgence of a virus that ~100% of the student population is vaccinated against? 😂😂😂😂 Fucking LMAO.

293,ltttpi,Questions on drinking/partying/social life/housing from an exchange student from the UK,"Obvious COVID disclaimer, any questions related to partying assume it'll be safe to do so next year.

I will (most likely) be studying as a junior at UW next year as an exchange student from the UK, and my only knowledge of drinking/partying/social life at US colleges comes from TV and movies so I've got like a dozen questions. Male, will be 20 for most of the school year.

Given the drinking age of 18, ""partying"" at uni in the UK involves just buying alcohol and drinking in halls, or going to university bars, or going to clubs/bars in the city (I live in London) like any adult. Pretty standard at my uni at least would be clubbing or going to student bar 2-4 times a week. How does UW compare?

The consensus from previous posts seems to be that if you're not ""in the Greek system"", as a guy you're not going to get into any frat parties. Is this still/actually the case? Also, what does ""in"" mean? Do you have to actually be in a frat, or if you are friends with fraternity member(s) will you be able to reliably get onto guestlists? Or is having friends get you on guestlists more of a sometimes works/sometimes doesn't thing?

If to reliably (like every week or fortnight) get into frat parties you actually have to be in a frat, is this an option for an exchange student? 

What are the non-frat options like? Do people under 21 generally have fake IDs and go to clubs/bars in the city? How common are non-frat house parties, and how is it to get into them? Is it just a case of knowing people?

Do most juniors/seniors live off-campus? I don't really want to have to try to organise private accom abroad, so assume I'll apply for halls/apartments, so would I live predominantly with people younger than me?

Are any halls more/less social than others? (the reputation seems to change year by year from previous posts). What are apartments like, as in do they have staff, or can you just drink as if it were private accom?

He asserted that the city is a mess, they are ""more concerned with straws than the homeless"", it's not their property nor responsibility, etc.

While this may be true, I would like input from anybody else on what kind of community effort that can be made about this. short of personally picking up the trash myself every morning. Writing to the manager? The City? What would be most effective?

Why should I care so much you might ask? I spend thousands of dollars at this business and am there almost everyday, and walk by frequently. It is a scourge. I would ""vote with my dollar"" and go elsewhere but options are limited in that area (Trader Joes does not have all the staples...)

Housing is really expensive, and the system is poorly organized. The undergrad classes aren't as exceptional as the high academic rating, which only comes from the amazing graduate schools, would make it seem. Class selection is average (in comparison to other colleges). 

Registration is horrible. But like many other things, this is mainly because of the awful technology department. 

The enormous population decreases the quality of everything. Housing becomes highly limited, registration is crowded and competitive, there are fewer open job opportunities, less professor-student interaction due to large classes,  etc. 
You just become another part of the huge, faceless crowd. Making friends or distinguishing yourself in any way is difficult because the sheer number of people, unless you deliberately go out of your way to do so.

People immediately started firing at me and some say I’m a 12 year old and some say I embarrassed the rest of you. I seriously lost hope in this city. I am an outsider and I will leave in just one year. I absolutely have no duty in making this place safer. However, I think it is in everyone’s favor that tragical incidents will not happen in the future. I posted this, at least as a reminder to raise awareness. What do I get? Criticism and hatred. Is it all because I said China is safer? There are a lot of country that are safer than the US and you are just going to sit there and be grumpy about it? I thought I did a good thing posting this in remembrance of the horrible incident that happened on the Ave yesterday. Apparently I’m wrong. You rather things stay this way than having an outsider pointing out the problem should be dealt with. 

           ————————Original Post———————

Almost everyday there is violent crime happening somewhere near the Ave. I just saw the email saying a girl was assaulted, pushed to the ground and slashed with a razor blade. Yesterday some one displayed a pistol; and just days ago some one even had an ax.

Why are we still so chill about it. The Ave has become the home for homeless people and every time I walk near them I feel deeply disturbed because they are all crazy and yell on the street all day. Incidents like those happen almost everyday and never was a suspect ever found by the police. There are no cameras, no nothing. And UW never did anything other than sending emails. As an university, UW has the responsibility to make its campus a safe place for everyone; but now, our very life is threatened everyday and there is nothing they are doing to prevent it. If it was other places, students would go on a strike a long time ago. We have to do something. Crimes like this is happening more and more often and we cannot just sit back and watch them happen. Next time, the victim might be us.

Edit: Why no one is focusing on the real underlying problem I’m trying to say here? I am not saying homeless people are the cause of all those problems. I don’t believe it was homeless people who robbed key bank yesterday, and I am not saying we should just make them leave. I am truly sorry for them and I often help them whenever I can. However, there are a lot of crazy people around the campus and you cannot deny that by saying the Ave is not part of the campus, that’s just ridiculous and lying to yourself. What I’m trying to say is we should urge the university and the police department to have better protection.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/evqade/why_are_we_still_so_chill_about_the_ave/,65,60,controversial

333,88ooyx,Feasibility of a CS Double-Major? (Hear me Out...),"So I am currently in the IBDP, and the way things are going, it's looking like UW is going to give me 45 credits at the start of my freshman year for doing so. From what I have seen, this is approximately a year's worth considering the minimum to graduate is 180 creds.

I am also a DA for UW CS, so that's my planned major.

I don't want to graduate early. So I have been thinking about possible alternatives. One of which is double-majoring. Now under normal circumstances I would understand being bombarded with ""dude, don't do it, you're going to die"" comments, but it doesn't seem that double-majoring within four years with 45 starting credits seems that ridiculous. But of course, I accept that I am probably totally naïve. 

I know that CS is going to be hard, but I think that doing another supplementary major like Statistics or Physics or something that would make me even more attractive for hiring could be a good idea. 

Any thoughts on this? Is there anyone who has done this with one of the majors being CS? Is this the most idiotic plan you've ever heard?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/88ooyx/feasibility_of_a_cs_doublemajor_hear_me_out/,34,4,controversial

“Please stop asking about schedules/courses.

I know you guys are freshman and are worried about maintaining a good GPA but college is about learning independence. The point of freshman year is to make decisions for yourself and learn about yourself and grow as a person. Your first year in college, you will run into difficulties, and you have to learn to manage it. 

Asking if 3 STEM class is manageable is a silly question. You know yourself better than we know you. If you are willing to put in the effort and time, you will be fine. If you don't think you can manage your time correctly, maybe take less STEM and explore other interests. Stop worrying if a particular class will be challenging, if it's a prerequisite class, you're going to take it eventually.

All in all, most classes will be hard. You will need to put in enough effort to do well in your classes.”

#1. Which campus should I attend if I want to continue my education in that field?

#2. Would any one of these campuses have a social aspect to it. As in are there any social events and opportunities to meet new people.

#3. If I were to transfer to UWT, would I be receiving the same education as at UWS since I'm first generation and have no idea which school is right for me.

#4. If I do transfer to UWT, would it be possible to cross-transfer campuses from UWT to UWS?

Edit: 

Should've added this as it wasn't at the top of my mind.

#5. If I do transfer to Udub Seattle, how do I find a commute from Tacoma to Seattle? And when I do get to the campus where do I park as I've heard stories of Seattle being a hotspot for motor theft.

6#.  Does UWT and UWS do FASFA or a dependency forum?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/15rhm9o/which_campus_branch_should_i_attend_uws_or_uwt/,39,0,controversial

381,7lqs7s,"Applying as a transfer student to CS, have lots of questions","So I currently go to a four-year state school on the east coast (nothing prestigious) and am interested in transferring to UW for CS. I feel that I'm not challenged at my current university. It's a huge party school and that's not really my scene. As pretentious and elitist as it sounds, I feel diosyapointed in myself for attending a university with the kind of people that attend my current school. Thus, I want to attend a university with excellent academics and a strong CS program.

Anyways, I applied to transfer last semester for aerospace engineering, and was rejected. I was a mechanical engineering major at the point and believed that I was interested in doing aerospace engineering. I have since switched to CS since I don't really want to be doing stress analyses for the rest of my life and am more interested in CS anyways. Since I switched majors, I am a freshman in terms of my major, so I am planning on transferring to UW as a sophomore. I selected to apply directly into the major as a transfer student, since I will have pretty much all of the prerequisites done (see questions below).

My GPA is much better this semester (~3.8/3.9 this past semester, 3.5 the semester before that, and a 3.0 my first year) after switching to CS. I think part of this that I decided I would give pre-med a shot, and that has given me the motivation to push for a 4.0. Without pre-med, my mindset was that I'd be able to get a job right out of college with my degree and work experience, and that I'd be fine with anything above a 3.0. Thus, there wasn't any motivation for pursue a higher GPA and that I could put in the minimum amount of work and get above a 3.0. But now I've proven to myself that I can get a good GPA!

Anyways, here are my questions:

1.  Unfortunately, my calculus courses did not cover double integrals or a few of the topics that MATH 126 covers. This shouldn't be a problem, should it? Luckily our intro to CS courses also cover Java, so they should count as CS 142 and 143. 

2. How competitive is it to transfer directly into CS as an out of state student (I put down informatics as my second major)? I have decent ECs (IMO) and a decent GPA (at least from this past semester). While I think that applying to UW and not applying for CS directly may be easier admissions wise, I don't want to be stuck with having nothing to do for a semester while I wait to apply for CS once I'm there (if that makes sense). Is that concern valid?

3. It shouldn't be an issue that I applied for a different major last year and was rejected, would it? One of the things I'm planning to address the fact that I keep switching majors in my essay, and say how switching to CS gives me the potential to take part in all of these industries that I might be interested in.

4. I'm currently a pre-med student, but I'll probably drop this if I transfer to UW to focus on CS, since I imagine the courses will be much harder and I won't have as much time to spare on taking pre-med prerequisites. Plus, I don't think I'm that interested in health anyways, now that I'm interested in doing CS. Should I mention the fact that I'm a pre-med student in my application? I'm worried that saying I will drop it in pursuit of CS is a red flag.

5. Is it okay to re-use passages from my essay from my last application? There are a few passages that I am proud of and are still accurate today that I am interested in using.

6. Is there anything like a student-run angel investing fund on campus? I'm pretty involved with one at my school currently, but, as much as I love what we do, I don't want it to be the only thing that keeps me at my current university. I'd love to participate in one at UW (if I get in).

7. The application says that I'll need to submit an application for my major along with the transfer application since I'm applying directly to the major. But, the CS school website says that students do not need to submit a separate application. Which is true?

I want to apply for direct admission to Comp sci, because I initially heard that if you don't get into the major, they won't reject you because of it. However, I recently heard from a current student that they have started rejecting those who do not get into comp sci so students wouldn't ""hang around waiting for something they will never get into,"" and have to go through an appeal process and change majors.

If this is the case, wouldn't it be better to decide on something that doesn't require direct admit (ex. Informatics, which I would be more than willing to do) if I don't have a stellar chance at majoring in CS? I would also like to know my chances of getting into UW in general.

Now I am back because I checked out some 13"" ultrabooks (Dell XPS 13, Macbook, & Macbook Pro) and realized how small 13 inches is. I am used to a 17"" gaming laptop and dual 27"" monitors.

My plan was to get a top-of-the-line ultrabook that I would use for the two years at Foster then at least two more at my job (currently aiming for general manager). 13 inches looked too small for good productivity though. I wouldn't be able to have two windows open (such as Word + a PDF). I'm thinking 13"" is a better size for school because of the reduced weight and for fitting onto small classroom desks, but for work, with a real desk, 15"" seems much more productive.

Does you guys share your good and bad experiences with 13"" and larger laptops at school?

http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/genedinq.html

This software is extremely easy to use. However, its yet another piece of poorly-written UW software released without testing or any indication that it doesn't really work. 

Though Academic advising says it locates all open courses, it misses many open UW courses. It doesn't locate any open online courses which fit just about anyone's schedule, or open courses where the professors don't specify times and puts ""to be arranged"". Often, these professors will arrange days and times that all students can attend later or will work out with students when to meet. These are among the best courses at the UW since they are usually small with very caring professors. 

You can find some of the UW's online courses at

http://www.pce.uw.edu/online-learning/

This probably isn't all of them. 

Again, beware of this tool. You'll miss hundreds of UW classes that might be perfert for you if you use it. Instead, use your advisor and the ENTIRE UW list at:

I have no idea if UW plans to add more classes to the in-person list before Fall, and not sure if that’d be wise. It’s perfectly fine how it stands, no reason to go fully online every damn quarter until we have 0 cases.


Edit 2: okay originally I was exaggerating about people saying online the full year but apparently people DO want that?! Get a fucking grip! 😂😂😂

Edit 3: Can y'all imagine a full year of online? Like, just thinking about it..I would probably end up with some major depression. I'd definitely postpone graduation to '22, that's for sure!

In any relationship, even with strangers, communication is key, instead of letting things reach a boiling point for yourself or the other person.

2. A person's past actions don't define who they are today. If I could shoot the person I was 10, or hell, even 5 years back, I would out of absolute disgust, but that's what we as humans do- we evolve from our mistakes and change over time.

522,ao8p3g,Message From Ana Mari Cauce,"Dear UW Community, 

We are all in shock and sadness over the death of a UW student after a tragic fall on the Seattle campus yesterday. I have spoken with the student’s father and my heart is with her grieving family and friends and all who knew her. 

This was a tragic accident, one that is felt very personally by me and all the UW staff who work to keep our campus safe, every day. Resources for anyone who needs support can be found in the links below. 

The decision to operate or suspend operations on our campus during inclement weather is ultimately my responsibility. It is made after careful assessment and deliberations with our facilities managers and the safety of our campus community is always the determining factor. By Wednesday, we determined that campus operations could resume. It is important to note that as a public, residential space, our campus is never “closed” and that there will always be people on the grounds. Our crews work around the clock to keep our campus roads and sidewalks as clear of snow and ice as possible, regardless of whether normal operations are suspended. 

With more snow in the forecast, we are already assessing campus conditions — the safety of our community will continue to be our priority. If you know of or become aware of places on campus where additional clearing or signage is needed, UW Facilities asks that you contact their customer care team to identify areas to service. I also encourage everyone to sign up for UW Alerts for updates and notifications about campus safety. 

The weather conditions we are experiencing are unusual and challenging for Seattle due to the combination of snow and below-freezing temperatures that prevent a full melt. Please take extra precautions, move a little slower, have patience with delays and watch out for your friends and colleagues. 

Please do know that we are doing, and will continue to do, all that we can to keep you and all who visit our campus as safe as possible. 

Sincerely,


Ana Mari Cauce

President

Professor of Psychology

However, I do not understand why UW is still asking students for full tuition when all the learning is done at home without getting any access to the facilities provided by UW. UW President is making millions of bucks by the way which I do not understand why they feel the necessity to leech off of us for the full tuition. Also, times like this, I think the acamdeia people need to reconsider about the upcoming finals for this quarter. I am not using the protest as an excuse to pass on the finals but more of can you guys for once be realistic and take the side of the students and the things we are going through. This protest is effecting many of us and I know that times are not easy for everyone to be in the right state of mind to push through school. One of my friend I know wanted to part of the peaceful protest but she realized she has classes to pass and had to pass up. I know as a student academic is important but this protest is more than just Floyd's death. It is fighting for justice and the mistreatment happening in the society for so many years and this is the time to put the government back in its right place and have them stop treating working and middle class like shit. All my thoughts and prayers are out there fighting for justice on the street and I hope that everyone stays safe and hope we get justice.

It doesnt matter if you do poorly, but giving up is the easy way out especially if someone else is paying for your education. 

I would feel fucking horrible if my parents were paying for my tuition and then not putting in all the effort I can. There are soooo many other people who wish they could be here but cant because of financial issues. Some people need to grow up and make smarter decisions. 

And im not saying im perfect. I slack off and procrastinate but I have never considered not taking a final or doing all that I could to get a good grade and understand the course material. (PS: I pay for my education by working and scholarships not one penny comes from my parents).

I read a little about the uw bothell program and it seems more about programming and exploring career paths in coding. obviously id rather go to uws if there program is the same tho.

another option too is to just go to a different university like western washing university which also seems more about programming as a whole.

I also heard a little bit about possibly going to the school of information and pursuing an informatics major. it seems to me that its just about user interface and improving media apps but again i could be completely wrong. if someone wants to touch up on that it would be super helpful.

My GPA as of right now is at a 3.6125, but I hope it will go up to a 3.7 if I do well during the Fall Quarter at EDCC (I'm a Running Start student studying CS; there's a bit of a GPA weight). My current SAT score is a 1390, but I'm not satisfied with that score, and I'm planning on taking the August SAT to hopefully get a score around 1450. My current ACT score is a 29 (I know, it's pretty weak, but I took the test as a dry run, meaning when I took the test, it was the first time seeing the format, without any prep at all). I am also in the Honor roll at EDCC, NHS, and a couple of intellectual clubs at my high school.

With my CURRENT GPA and test scores, what are my chances of acceptance?

595,osufuo,"Rant: Convinced UW will Rescind ""No Mask Requirement"" for fall","[First, here's a CDC study about the effectiveness of vaccination.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7013e3-H.pdf)

Now that the CDC is recommending ""universal masking for teachers, staff, students and visitors in schools, regardless of vaccination status and community transmission of the virus"" I'm planning to take fall quarter off.

I've followed the science, I've masked up, I've gotten vaccinated.  I've returned to not wearing a mask. 

But then this dropped.

But now I'm tired of these masks, I'm tired of the isolation, I'm tired of the fear, I don't expect I'll return to the devoted quarantining that I practiced for the past 16 months.  I've had an incredibly hard time staying motivated in my coursework with this whole ""remote learning"" fiasco. 

I've been vaccinated.  *We've* all been vaccinated.  We will not be able to attend classes unless we attest that we are vaccinated.  Does the vaccine work or doesn't it?  Who are we, the vaccinated, protecting?  Am I supposed to wear a mask so that if I get COVID, I'm protecting the anti-vaxxers?  Not worth it in my mind.

No more gym w/o a mask?  No library without a mask?  We're going to go back to all of that?  No thanks.  I'd rather opt out of fall quarter.  If it's so dangerous, classes should still be remote, anyways.  This is not worth the *massive* amount of money I'm paying for this bullshit college experience.

From the CDC: “In rare occasions, some vaccinated people infected with a Delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others.”

Sure, I get it.  But this is no longer our pandemic.  As the Director of the CDC said, this is now a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” But she's worried that ""vaccinated people who are in a place with substantial or high transmission could contract a breakthrough infection, and could pass the virus onto unvaccinated family members or those with weakened immune systems and others most at risk.""  Not my problem.  I'm vaccinated.  You're vaccinated.  I'm not going to give it to you.  You're not going to give it to me.

And now that I've written this incredibly self-centered post, I still see the importance of protecting those that are vulnerable, including the IDIOTS that have just decided not to get vaccinated.  So, I guess I'll see you all on campus.  But you won't be able to tell I'm grumpy, cause my frown will be covered.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/osufuo/rant_convinced_uw_will_rescind_no_mask/,68,131,controversial

643,izn6iy,Math Placement for 120,"Hello all

I've applied to UW for Winter 2021, but am preparing to take the Self Guided Math Placement so I can be ready to take MATH 120 on my first quarter.

Currently, I'm working through Khan Academy and doing pretty well (I'm working through Algebra II and will probably work on Precalc if I have time -- I like maths!). My question to you all is are there resources where I can get a 'practice' test? I know that UW has a couple of sources for review which I will probably use if nothing else, but they have the answers directly next to the questions which kinda makes it difficult. 

I've taken practice Accuplacer tests and I'm nearly 100% confident that I've studied enough to get a half-decent score, but I'm not sure how well these translate. I'm also not sure if I'm able to retake the Self Guided Math Placement before I start UW (acceptance permitting) in case I end up in a lower class than I had hoped. 

TL;DR 

-- Are there any resources with an actual test practice that are similar to the Self Guided Math Placement, or are the resources on UW my best option?

-- Can I retake the Self Guided Math Placement before taking a maths class if I'm unhappy with my placement?

Thanks in advance!

I am currently taking Math 308, PHYS 121, and AFRAM 337 and research credits. I'm a Freshman applying to Computer Science this summer.  I did poorly on the first 308 midterm and I think at best I could get a 3.3.   My other classes have been: Math 125: 3.8, Math 126: 3.7, CSE 142/143: 3.8/4.0 ENGL 111: 4.0, ENGR 115: 4.0.  Will having the W on my transcript be more detrimental than having a grade around a 3.3 for Math 308 (best case scenario)?

You might think that I'm a bit late since the deadline for applying is just hours away. But I got to know about this program a few minutes ago :(

What I've understood from their website is that it is an interdisciplinary program for students interested in more than one majors. Correct me if I'm wrong, as I think I don't understand what it is. 

I'm applying for Electrical Engineering (first choice) and Computer Engineering (second choice). I'm interested in Brain-Machine Interfaces and might work on them in future. This will require knowledge in other fields like Neuroscience, Material Science etc. 

Do you think I should apply for the honors program? Also, will applying for the honors program affect the chances of my admission into UW. I saw a video in which they said: ""admission into the honours program is contingent on admission into UW"". I don't understand what that means. 

Stats (if they matter)

SAT: 800 Math ([UW only looks at Math scores of International Applicants](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/how-to-apply/#test-scores))

School doesn't give a GPA, but I rank around 50-100 in a class of 900 with the percentage I get each year.

I have pretty good ECs: robotics and aerospace projects, along with awards at International Robotics Competitions and a few competitions at NASA (can't go into more details to maintain anonymity).

661,78hy7r,UW International Student Application,"Hello everyone! 

I am an international student applying to the University of Washington from Russia. I have a few things to clarify, and I am convinced that this is an appropriate place because some of my questions are specifically about UW.

Major: International Relations/Political Science.

Here are some stats: 
1. Ethnicity: Russian. I believe it might help because there are very few (if any) Russian at the University of Washington. Here comes diversity. 
2. GPA: I believe it is something around 4.6-4.7/5.0 (on 5 scale). I attend very rigorous school in my country, so it is really hard to be a stellar student, taking into account that everyone is obliged to follow a national curriculum. Anyway, GPA is probably within the range of acceptance. 
3. TOEFL. I have got 85 overall, with 28 out of 30 on the Writing section. Some of you might say that it is not that much, but I personally believe that it is quite good; UW requires the minimum of 76, so I am okay on this requirement. I have also taken IELTS, and I have scored 6.5 overall. Still not sure which one to send. 
4. SAT. I have had a bad experience taking the SAT exam because I am not used to such system. I mean, it was quite hard to do 60 problems in like 60 minutes. No way. You would say it is all about strategies and time-management, but those who say these things were educated in the US and they were taught these things (the way things are teacher in every country is different, just saying). Well, I scored 1060, which is above the national average (and I should be proud of myself because many U.S. students did worse than I did). I have not studied for it, by the way. Of course, you must think that I am very dumb, but this is who I am. Yes, I did badly on the test, but I am very industrious, willing to work and passionate. It is just not the way I should be judged. And here is the thing: UW does not require SAT/ACT for international admission. I am taking ACT just for a change (maybe, it will be better). But I do not really plan to send it to the UW. 
5. Essays: I have done a good job writing my essays. They are almost completed. I assume they are quite good, but I also don't have a explicit idea what I am expected to write about, though. 
6. ECs: Not much to say about it. In Russia, the priority is given to academics, so we do not really have any clubs, organizations, volunteering, etc. Nonetheless, I have done some things outside the classroom. First of all, I have served as Steam Community Translator @ Valve Software translating Valve games into Russian. I was some kind of leader when it came to proofreading Russian translations. It is so because I had the deepest understanding of how the Russian language was structured. Secondly, I have participated in many All-Russian Olympiads in Social Sciences (Law, Russian History, Sociology, Russian, English). I have done pretty well on them, and they are really rigorous. I guess it is worth mentioning on my college application. Secondly, I have been playing as a goalkeeper for a local soccer team. We are not really good, but since the US college want to see that you are active, I guess it is worth telling them that I am also sporty. I might also mention that I am a participant of the UN Model. So, am I good in terms of ECs? 

Please chance me for the UW based on the information above. Thank you in advance. 

Here are few questions that concern me: 
1. Why UW does not require SAT for international students? Does it mean that they are basically cash cows and they are treated this way? I do not think that is cool.
2. Will I be able to find any job in the United States after graduation if I major in International Relations or Political Science? Provided that I also speak Russian fluently and + one more foreign language. My main goal is to stay in the US, so it is really important. I do not mind hearing from international students, and I would especially appreciate your responses. 
3. How is the school overall? Tell me your experience. 

Thank you for your attention and patience.

684,2c0wk6,How social is Mercer Court?,"So I ended up in Mercer Court for this year and I can't find much information on what it's like to live there, seeing as it's only been recently constructed. What I'm wondering is if it offers anything like the other dorms in getting to know your whole floor, or if you tend to be isolated to your cluster. The lack of a common area for each floor, and only one common meeting place for the entire area from what it seems, has me worried in the event that the 7 other people I've been randomly assigned to don't turn out well.

I know I can still have a social life outside of my dorm if I put myself out there, but I'm worried about missing out on something, especially during freshman year.

Also, how big are the undergrad bedrooms? Is the security at or above the level of the regular residence halls?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/2c0wk6/how_social_is_mercer_court/,7,0,controversial

686,277t4x,Honors physics and EE admissions,"I'm going to UW next year as a pre-engineering major. Looking at the honors physics 121-123 details, it looks like it would be a lot more enjoyable, with smaller class sizes, better instructors, and a focus on quantum mechanics and relativity. Can anyone who has taken it talk about the difficulty and workload of it compared to the normal classes?

I also have the problem of admission to the EE department that I want to sort out. I want to apply ASAP, and the science pre-requisites are CHEM 142, and PHYS 121/122. Honors physics only runs in a specific order from Autumn to Spring quarters, which means that I can't take CHEM 142 first quarter. If I take chemistry Spring quarter, then I lose priority registration for PHYS 123 in Autumn of the next year, and I also can't do honors for the last section. However, this lets me apply to EE by the end of freshman year. I could also take two science classes in one quarter, but I've read around here that it is a very bad idea to try that. On the other hand, if I take all of honors physics during freshman year, and take chemistry in fall of sophomore year, I can get all of the classes I want, but it delays the application date. This worries me, due to the possibility of having to re-apply several times if my GPA is too low, and it's cutting it close to the beginning of the major-specific courses. Does anyone have any experience with trying to cram in courses like this, or am I making too big of a deal about applying late?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/277t4x/honors_physics_and_ee_admissions/,8,2,controversial

698,uawj5h,New thrifting app for UW students !,"I stumbled across a QR code on campus the other day and found out about Thrifthouse which is an app made by some MIT students that allows you to sell your clothes, shoes, textbooks, appliances, etc. to other students at your college campus. You need to log in with your student ID and everything so it is very secure and only reaches other UW students. It makes selling shit so easy because you don’t have to package and ship out your item like you would for Depop. You just need to meet up at like paccar or ode and that it. Anyway I’ve been using the app for awhile and have been selling stuff here and there just because the creators of the app sometimes give you free money to spend on the app as an incentive to buy and sell things. The only thing is, as with any startup, not a lot of people know about the app so there’s not many new items being sold or even being listed on the app on a weekly basis. 

So I am here to tell all of y’all to GET THRIFTHOUSE. 

I feel like this app has the potential to be a mainstream UW student app just because it’s so convenient and allows you to make a few bucks if your moving out and trying to get rid of things. Anyway, if any of you guys are interested here’s the link:) I feel like I’m an ambassador or something but I swear I actually just love the concept of this app so much.

My choices have boiled down to:

- UW (Seattle):
Pros: Can actually compete for majors. Seattle is the best location for me personally.
Cons: No guarantees.

- UCSD:
Pros: Backup majors are tier 2. To not call them top-tier is splitting hairs. Location is ideal for career.
Cons: CS transfer admissions are literally random. Once you pass the cutoff GPA, you have no influence.

- WSU:
Pros: They'll let me study CS
Cons: They're WSU. I don't think I need to say more here. :) I've lived in Pullman. It's not the greatest place for me.

Going to WSU seems silly. Shade-throwing aside, they'll eat me up should I decide transfer out of either UCSD or UW, so picking one first makes sense. So the question is then: Should I just settle on a backup and make the best of it at UCSD, or try my hand at pre-CS at UW?

725,70inew,What are my chances of getting into UW (NOT Trolling),"I had posted about this before, but I'd like to go a little more in depth.

So I royally screwed up when I was in high school. I graduated in 2009, but my final GPA was 2.6.

Anywhew, for a litany of reasons (mainly alcohol/drug abuse and major depressive disorder), I continued my terrible academic streak with a stint at a state college in Connecticut, where I am originally from.   

I ended up essentially skipping out on all my classes for one semester, and did not return.

I just looked at my old transcript from this school, and I received one F, three W's (withdraws), and one N (never attended). 

That was in 2010.

In spring of 2016, after living in Washington for a year, I decided to give college a more serious go. I am two quarters away from finishing my DTA Associates Degree from Whatcom Community College, I currently have a **4.0 GPA** and plan on keeping it until I transfer. 


 Obviously I plan to elaborate on why my High school and early college careers were such disasters, I was attending rehabilitation for a period in high school, my parents divorced, mother diagnosed with cancer, general angsty teen stuff.... constantly struggling to maintain a sense of well being. 

I plan on highlighting my strengths in my application as well, duh.

 I don't want to bore you too much with them, so I'll be brief:

Basically around 2012 I started working for a high profile entertainment promotions/marketing company named ""Celebrity Access"". I worked there for 4 years, was promoted to Tour Date Manager after the first year. This was essentially the type of career that a Com major like myself seeks. In other words, I have already worked in the field. 

I began to realize that it was possible to make it without a college degree, however the further I went in the field the more I recognized the importance of having a formal college education. These days, you are always given more opportunities when you have that badge under your belt. 

That being said, I eventually left the job on good terms, to travel the country and find the right school, eventually finding myself in Washington state. 

Its been a roller coaster ride, but I am hoping that UW will see the stark contrast between my academic record as a kid, and my academic record now as a 26 year old. It truly is a night and day difference. 

What do you think my chances are of getting into UW?

Has anyone been in this situation before? If so, please share!

Do you think they will seriously take into account my first college stint when configuring my ""transfer GPA""? I don't think W's and N's can be taken into account, meaning the one F may be the only grade to potentially transfer (and haunt me). But come on! I've got a 4.0 now... 

Obviously there are a lot more things I could tell you about myself (volunteer work, passions, etc), but I think you get the gist. 

Edit - oh, and yes, around the age of 22 I did in fact take control of my own life. I do not drink or take drugs anymore. At 26, I can 100% say that I am the happiest I have ever been, more focused than ever!

But doing so in a classroom full of people who are struggling to just pass the class with a 2.0... that's not cool. I know you're a freshman, but I can only hope for your sake that you learn the difference between *gaining an education* and *earning a degree* before you graduate. This isn't high school anymore. Grades aren't everything. Grades don't make a person. Grades are not an accurate measure of the skills and capacity of a person.  And to top it off by ostentatiously boasting about yours in a class full of struggling freshmen, many of whom might be first-generation college students, or students away from their home with little-to-no support structure? Do everyone a favor and brag to your parents or your friends instead, not loudly during class, repeatedly throughout the quarter.


Edit: My intent in this post was not to make leaping, unfounded accusations about the original student not being a first-generation student or being disadvantaged in someway herself. It was to illustrate the point that there are people who might be disadvantaged from circumstances outside their control who could become discouraged and on top of that because they’re not doing well. I also wasn’t meaning to attribute their success to something outside of their own work ethic and drive. 

Edit2: Since everyone is assuming I’m jealous: I’m not. I have a 4.0 as well. I just don’t agree with bragging openly at the risk of discouraging other people who aren’t doing as well.

741,1ryb8e,The future of the University of Washington?,"Hey Huskies,

I had an interesting conversation with a recruiter at Amazon (UW Alum), and she was talking a lot about the computer science program here at the UW, how it is amazing, but recently some professors are leaving (she mentioned a name and said he is a very popular researcher in the field, just don't recall the professors name) to other universities such as Stanford, or other elite schools. I myself am a freshman here at the UW, majoring in CSE, but after this convo with the recruiter, it is making me think, how is the UW doing right now? I know it is ranked top 50, or even 16th in some rankings, but as a school, is it doing better? or is it doing worse than previous years? This years incoming freshman class was the largest, so I'd imagine this is a good sign?

The university is constantly expanding, and for such a HUGE university, it is quite impressive how laid out the programs are here (excluding registration hehe). I was accepted to top CSE programs too (Columbia, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley) but I choose the UW mainly because of it being located in Seattle, as I want to be apart of the giant startup scene, and of course, it is a top 10 school in the field. But even with that aside, is the UW progressing in terms of being better? or is it really falling behind? 

Sorry for rambling and probably being redundant, I've been studying for finals, and figured it would be awesome to hear more from other huskies about this topic, as I definitely feel the university is heading towards the right path...

What are we looking for? We're looking to recruit 15 (> 23+) grad students who were or are freelancers, mid-late stage startup leaders, or dealing with clients, ideally with pain points in managing documents on Google Drive and Slack, to help us test the app. Volunteers will be testing the app during their free times throughout the alpha stage (beta will be released sometime in February 2021) and will be asked to give feedback once a week. If you find value in the app, we would love for you to continue throughout our product stages! In return, users joining during our exclusive alpha stage will get free access to our beta product, as we will be planning to charge people for beta!

I'd be majoring in Environmental Sciences in both schools, and they both seem to be strong in that. Cost wise, I'd be considered out of state/international (I'm coming from Maryland, so distance and travel costs are about the same) and UBC is a bit cheaper given the exchange rate, but UW did give me money all four years. So my costs would be like 39k comprehensive UBC vs 43k comprehensive for UW. And between the two cities, I like them both enough. Anyone else had a similar choice to make, and how did you make that?

I just wanted to get peoples opinions on if I should drop the class or try to do better with the final. If I end up trying the latter, and say don't do good, and end the quarter with a bad grade in math, and then if I request placement into 125 next quarter and do better, will this be worse than having simply dropped the class and done better on the second time?

If I drop I can focus on my other classes which does sound somewhat appealing, but I think I would be  playing with fire trying to get a 3.0 and I heard its not even that good anyway.

I support Israel and Palestine, but condemn Hamas - I support two state solution but fuck Hamas and their atrocities

I support Palestine, but condemn Israel - Palestine people are people too, you can't treat them like animals

I support saving all civilians, both Israel and Palestine, but fuck both Hamas and Benjamin (Israel PM) - Both elected governments and head of states are corrupted to its core and both sides of their civilians should elect a new government 

I support neither/rather not say - Pretty much you shut your mouth about this or don't have a final opinion yet

Ah shit here we go again - Another broken ceasefire for the 66th gazillion time and more human suffering that both sides blame each other for

Please don't murder me on campus :(

I am a female, living in Stevens Court A, it's a 2nd floor 6 bedroom apartment, 9 months lease. I want to switch to a room in Stevens Court J, K, L, or M.

I know the A building is much older and you are thinking, ""why should I swap rooms with you?"". Reasons you may want to switch are: 

* you live on the ground floor and feel unsafe opening the window  for fresh air. If you swap rooms with me, you can open the window with no worry of someone breaking into the room.
* you live on the ground floor and feel hesitant to open the blinds for light because people will see into your room. If you swap rooms with me, you can open the blinds more freely as I have a room on the second floor, and it faces the back.
* you don't like sunlight shining into your eyes at 7:00 am. The room I have currently does not have that problem, as it does not face the direction of the sunrise.
* you don't like your roommates. You can get new ones if you move into my room.
* your roommates are too loud. The other people in my apartment keep to themselves mostly and I haven't really heard anything from them.
* your currant roommates are slobs. The people in my apartment are not.

The reason I want to move is because I am a very private person and sharing a bathroom with 5 other people is not ideal for me. 
If you are interested in switching but are worried that one bathroom is too small for 6 people please do not worry too much. During the past week, I have not seen anyone trying to use the bathroom while I was using it. If you are worried about someone using the bathroom when you also want to use the bathroom, there are two toilets/sinks/showers so there is enough room for everyone. 

If you wouldn't mind living in Stevens Court A, but think switching rooms is too much of a hassle I can pay the room switch fee for you, help you move, and pay you an extra $100 dollars for switching with me!

So if you are interested in switching, or know someone who is interested in switching, please PM me!

I ask because I am applying to the math major for spring quarter, and my grades for the Calc series are: 4.0, 3.8, 3.9. Now in Calc 2 and 3 I felt that I really understood the material, but I had other engagements outside of class (work) and was taking Physics in addition to Calc. In the case of Calc 2 I actually underwent surgery during the quarter which caused me to get a lower grade on one of my midterms. I still feel that I could have done a lot better in those classes.

Does UW not care about this? I mean, I have no problem with them hanging out here and all, but sometimes it makes me a little uncomfortable.

So far, I have noted:


*Location: 3rd Floor Ode

Person: Old white lady all in black.

Description: All she does is hang around on a computer on the quiet floor and watches videos all day. If she has to leave to get food or whatever, she will leave all her garbage/mess there for people not to take her spot. She sometimes answers the phone and answers it then after like 30 seconds finally goes to the bathroom to talk more comfortably.

Note: Ode staff never checks if she has a Husky Card after 7pm. Weird.


*Location: Suzzallo/Allen Basement

Person: Black dude with an oxygen tank.

Description: This guy just posts himself at the same desk here everyday and looks homeless. When the library closes, I see him just walking around campus at night. Not sure what he does until it closes.


*Location: Ode 1st & 3rd Floors

Person: Old Asian guy with a beanie

Description: This dude just hangs around Ode and just pulls his beanie over his head and just sleeps it off. Can be found on single chairs in first floor or 3rd floor.


*Location: HUB area on first floor where people take naps

Person: Old white lady

Description: This lady is just flat out crazy. If you sit by her, you'll just see her lying down on a couch, possibly sleeping. When she's not slumbering, you'll hear her talking to herself in an aggravated tone, which makes me a little uneasy for my safety at times.


*Location: Savery Hall

Person: Older white guy dress all in black.

Description: This guy hangs around in Savery during the night. He's dressed all in black with a black beanie covering most of his head that makes him look a little sketchy. I've seen him walking around campus sometimes, definitely not a student here. You can find him sleeping in Savery rooms throughout various times of the day since Savery apparently never locks their doors at night.


*Location:Ode

Person: Old white guy with a weird dress attire + bucket hat and glasses.

Description: This guy just lingers around Ode all day. I've made eye contact with him so many times and it feels like he just stares at me. Just plain creepy.

914,141854c,"Hello, guys, desperately need some of your help here. I am so stuck.","Hello, everyone. It is surely a pleasure and honor to be able to join this vibrant community of UW but I am now experiencing some troubles here. I am intl student and I am now having some daunting troubles of getting my visa to study at UW. I wrote this email to the ISS office in the hope to receive some help from them. For me, joining UW is sort of like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Also, it could be just my affection for every aspect and bit of this community which propels me to never give away my endeavors to work towards physically arriving here. I genuinely hope that you could take several minutes to read my story and possibly offer me some help or advice on my situation. I included details in the letter below:

Dear officers at UW ISS,

Greetings. I really hope that you could read my following words and consider them carefully, as it is absolutely something that directly pours out of a student who is now working desperately hard to get to UW and start his academic journey. As previously mentioned, my background is very different from most other students from UW and it could be something that affects my visa application. I applied for a student visa in Beijing, China today but unfortunately got rejected. I discussed the situation on my visa application form(DS160) about how I tried to overcome the bullying issues, which were seriously hindering my education and have cost me several years out of school, creating a gap in my education. But it seems that the visa officer did not read it in full detail at all(maybe because it was kind of long) and did not acknowledge my situation. It is likely that they only thought about the fact that I am older than other ordinary students and just rejected me, assuming that I have ***immigration intent*** because I am attending college at my current age. They may have concerns that I would overstay/work illegally once I got the visa.

But it is not the truth, bullying is nothing that should be considered my fault and I suffered a lot from the situation. I have seen quite a lot of people with similar situations never be able to rise up from the abyss where they were struggling. But God knows how I managed to overcome those exceedingly insurmountable obstacles and managed to come back from that. I think it is the innate determination that has pushed me finally to this stage of life. It is funny that the bullies and everyone else from my previous school here in China never made it to UW or other similarly prestigious universities. 

After I was forced out of school because of these incidents, I almost never ceased learning everything I had at hand. I have been so desperately working hard to absorb every bit of knowledge that I have in my sight. I have come back from that abyss where a significant number of people were crashed, hammered, and scattered in pieces and I do not want this to affect my hard-earned opportunities anymore. I want to go to UW without being accused of having immigration intent and being older than other students. I hope everything I worked up will eventually pay off for me and I know I am well worth it. I promise I will work hard amongst the top determined students you have ever seen in your career and I hope I can have a chance to make you and UW proud! I have come back from a student who did not know how to cope when forced out of a Chinese middle school to someone that finds his way to finish four years of U.S. high school in one year and successfully send himself to college. I want to keep being a miracle worker! I love UW and desperately want to come!

Sincerely, may I please have some assistance regarding my visa application from UW? Today, I was rejected by an officer in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, likely due to my previous visa rejections when going to a community college(I wanted to transfer to a 4-year university from a CC first) and the fact I am older than other undergraduate college students, which means I am 26 years old now. Could you please offer me some guidance and assistance regarding my unique situation? I really want to nail this visa application and successfully come to UW.

Heck even the US border guards when I was going back to Seattle were wearing masks, but when I came back to Canada, the border guards there weren’t wearing them and they were sitting less than 2m from each other just chatting.

I think seeing so many “Karens” on social media refusing to wear mask and flaunting their white privilege can be frustrating and discouraging, and as much as Canadians like to feel we’re superior to the Americans, I think the majority of people in the US, or at least in Washington state are taking this seriously.

933,q4uebp,Let's have a serious discussion - What will be the necessary conditions for COVID to no longer impact our daily lives?,"Many parts of the country have already begun a transition back to normal, but I have observed the state of Washington, and apparently the students at UW, are very resistant to this transition. There has been this delta scare that has gone on now for a while, which has appeared to keep us in a perpetual loop of restrictions. 

What I want to address today, is what exactly the road to 'normalcy' will look like. There seems to be no mention of when the mask mandate will be lifted, or what the actual plan is for resolving our current state of affairs. Regarding vaccines, a strong majority of people are **already fully vaccinated**. The only people that aren't are:

* Those that are immunocompromised - this portion of the population is not going anywhere, there will always be people with weakened immune system and they will always be unfortunately over-susceptible to a **wide array of illnesses**, not just COVID.

* Those that are resisting getting vaccinated for their own moral or religious reasons - at the end of the day, there isn't much you can do about people who are delusional without going against their civil liberties and forcing them to do something against their will (which we need to ask ourselves, can we really resort to that?)

So as we have logically established, these two groups are not going anywhere, and by the way, neither are viral variants. Viruses adapt the same way any organic system would, and there will **always be** new mutations to deal with. 

-------------------

Also, before you tell me to ""suck it up and wear a mask"", I would like to point out that current restrictions extend way beyond just mask wearing:

* Many events (at least in my experience) that would normally be held in-person have still been virtualized, taking the human element and ability to meet other people out of them, despite the fact that a return to classes has been allowed. 

* Eating food in any area that is not an 'established common area' like the hub is disallowed (this doesn't even make any sense to me, if we have allowed people to eat maskless at the hub, why not in other indoor areas?)

* Currently you are not allowed to even drink coffee during classes (only water) due to having to pull down your mask to do so.

* Everyone must continue to wear masks even when inside gyms or fitness centers, and if you are engaging in a particularly aerobic task such as treadmill running, the issues with wearing a mask while doing so can range from miserable to straight up dangerous (asphyxiation). 

* I am not even sure why, but it seems like a lot of the students here feel compelled to wear their masks even when walking outside - I personally don't and I constantly feel like I am being stared at as if I am some sort of anti-vaxxer...

------------------

So now, to conclude, if all of these things have now reached a point of 'static equilibrium' and we still have all of these restrictions placed on us, I question how exactly we can ever contemplate the idea of returning back to some notion of normal. Now I ask all of you, what do you envision the roadmap might look like, or do you believe we should permanently live our lives as we are now?

I earned at least 3 Bs in my 1st semester and astonishingly received a D in AP CS A (I had no prior CS experience by the way). I stopped attending school consistently due to a string of numerous illnesses (flu, covid, staph infection) starting in November 2022 and that has led to me ""snowballing"" my lack of preparation for tests and school in general. 

In short, I am very worried about my 2nd semester grades (potentially dropping below 3.0) and whether or not I would be rescinded for this precipitous drop in academics, and I am unsure if my explanation to the admissions office about my illnesses would suffice.

956,r7ma9z,Husky Card Rant (keep scrolling),"Disclaimer:  I'm not looking for solution, as this is not a *real* problem.  I have just found the scenario humorous enough to write about while drinking a beer.  If you're a hater, kindly downvote and leave your negative comments to yourself.  I'm fortunate enough for the following situation to be the biggest issue I've got right now, following traffic & MGH wifi, and I do not take this seriously.

I'm a weird person and I don't like cords or plugging things in.  I love the fact that I can place my phone down and it starts charging instead of having to plug it in.  I made a decision on the air buds I use because the case can be charged wirelessly.  These simple pleasures I treasure.

I keep my husky card in my phone protector.  When I need to get on the light rail, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  When I need to get into UW buildings after hours, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  I love how seamless this is.  But then there is the IMA.  Because of COVID and a lack of lockers, I have to keep my stuff at my locker in the HUB, where I change and then jog to the IMA.  I don't like heavy things in my pockets when I'm running, so I don't bring my wallet, I don't bring my keys.  I bring my phone and that's it.

But at the IMA we have to *swipe* our ID card, to obtain access.  That's no biggie, I changed my phone protector to be one that has the cover that opens up like a book, which has a place to put ids, etc.  So, I get in, I take out my card, swipe, and then happily go to sweat and suffer.

A couple weeks ago the magnetic swipe stopped working.  The very kind and patient staff at the IMA happily took my card and manually looked me up to make sure I wasn't some degenerate WSU student or something, and then let me pass.  After this happened multiple days in a row, one of them suggested that I get a new card; I could tell their patience was wearing thin.  I thought, why should I get a new card?  It still works everywhere else?    When I need to get on the light rail, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.  When I need to get into UW buildings after hours, I put my phone next to the sensor and it works.

I found out that the reason is that magnetic swipes are prone to corruption when they are placed in electromagnetic fields like the ones created on wireless chargers.  I got a new card.  This time, I decided to just leave it in my wallet.  That worked fine.  Lightrail - still worked.  After-hour access - still worked.  I just hold my wallet next to readers instead of my phone.  But then - of course - I forgot one day to remember to take my card out of my wallet to bring with me to the IMA when I tried to take it out of my phone.  Next week, I did it again.

Fine, how about I just take it out of my phone case every night before I charge it?  That worked for about a week until I forgot to take it out and now it doesn't work again.

I've now purchased a new phone case to allow access to the card, and two new husky cards.  But there is an obvious solution, here.  Why can't the IMA just put the same kind of scanner for access instead of the swipey thing?  Can't they see they are causing me *immense* frustration?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/r7ma9z/husky_card_rant_keep_scrolling/,11,10,controversial

Our    project needs short-term volunteers (no skills or money required) to    help build a database to train a machine learning algorithm that will    contribute to our overall project of tracking Russian military  movements   in Ukraine. We need individuals to help us with the  following tasks:

1. Identify images of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers and military equipment.
2. Collect images featured in Russian propaganda. 

The    individuals volunteering to sort images of soldiers and military    equipment will be provided an easy crash course by the verification team    lead (me). Here is an example of the material that will be covered in    the crash course: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo).    Volunteers will be provided images and clearly marked folders in  which   to sort them. Military knowledge helpful but not necessary.  
The    atrocities committed by Russian forces every day are testament to the    need for efficient and reliable real-time tracking of Russian troop    movements for the safety of Ukrainian civilians. Please help by  donating   some of your time. Even as little as a couple hours would be  helpful.   It’s possible to volunteer remotely any day of the week, but  we usually   meet at 10pm over Zoom. **I  am  also a college student in Boston, and our team consists of college   students and subject field experts in the US and Europe.
